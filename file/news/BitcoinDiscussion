Title: A Lonely Old Bitcoin Miner Bids Farewell...

Thanks for your work, Old Timer. Hate to lose you, but thanks for what you have done to break the trail!..Fair winds and following seas friend.

I used to believe that PoS would allow even little guys to participate. That is, until 1 week  before the migration I discovered that 6 major corporations had front-run and captured over 51% of the staking share. Now that they have it, there is nothing that can be done to dislodge them. It’s game over before it even started.

Sad, this is what carbon religion does to people. Transforming you from a pioneer to a shitcoiner.

Before you get kicked out...  How do you feel about the pre-mine from Ethereum?

Bitcoin is the idea, a peer to peer currency. .But:.- mining is only profitable for some, after the halving only those with access to the cheapest energy will keep mining..- while my Ethereum node runs off the iPad charger..- doesn’t support smart accounts, with social recovery. I sleep well knowing if fire occurs or I lose my passphrase, I won’t lose my life savings..- I can quickly swap my tokens to basically any other token on the planet with instant speed and sub-cent fees on L2 of my choice..- I can and did write smart contracts with real world usage...My first crypto was Bitcoin. Sadly, it was a decade ago and since then, no advancements in technology were made..While Ethereum keeps improving year on year...Bitcoin is the idea. Ethereum is execution.

The reason that it seems only big mining farm or heavily-invested miners can now play the mining game is that it is difficult to distribute a tiny share of block reward in small blocks.  You could play the mining game if your "USB mining chip" is as efficient as those of other heavy-invested miners and the block is big...The proof-of-energy-work is essential as you could use the same amount of energy to boil the same amount of water even with advanced heating technology in a far future.  Energy is the universal accounting basis so it is the best measurement of cost.  Trust must be maintained and manufactured and cannot come from thin air as trust is the cost to rollback the commitment.  If you think some proof-of-X works, you re-run the ugly history of a bad money system.  In ideal proof-of-energy-work, you sacrifice 1 joule to get 1 joule trust.  In a proof-of-X system, if you only spend, opaquely and equivalently, 0.2 joule to get 1 joule trust, there is a gap of 0.8 joule for rent-seekers and the proof-of-X system will go sour someday somewhere somehow by someone for sure.

"Finally, the Ethereum ecosystem (including layer 2s, etc.) seems to be where the actually interesting applications that were dreamed of in the early bitcointalk.com days are becoming reality. "  ...Imagine mining for 14 years and only reading headlines. You still have A LOT to learn. A bit too early to declare total victory and that you know everything you need to know. Looks like you havent spent much time looking at bitcoin code.

Trading is not for the weak, I tried trading and also tried copy trading and I lost funds, until i was introduced to Prime Clinch RCV. They are genius when it comes to cryptocurrencies trading, the way they analyses the market, their expertise and guidance have led me to fruitful outcomes in my trading endeavors and best part they still gives a good result even with the fluctuations of the market. I started with the least and now I earn $30k to $50k weekly without stress not just that, they also gives me guidelines on how I could recover back the lost $153,000 funds i invested with the wrong crypto unregulated platform and to my amazing surprise it was also a success. If you seek success in your cryptocurrencies trades, I highly recommend reaching out to Prime Clinch RCV via Email: (info@primeclinch.pro) Telegram username: (prime\_clinch) and embark on your journey to financial success.

> Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake also deals with the somewhat dystopian energy-use reality of PoW mining in a world where energy consumption is one of the existential questions for our species...That transition to PoS shows the project is captured and centralized and not worth anyone's time. It's just another company, which is fine if you want to buy stock in a company, but it's not what they advertise...> If the only way to secure a network to your satisfaction is to burn so much energy that it pushes the world towards one of the more horrifying climate models, one should question whether such true trustlessness is desirable..By tying money to energy it encourages finding new energy sources. The cost of energy goes down exponentially in bitcoin terms. With low cost of energy, many applications like desalination become economically viable....Deserts have lots of solar energy and little cloud coverage. You can recoup the costs of deploying a solar farm in the desert where there are no people around to pay for it otherwise by mining bitcoin. You can pull water out of the atmosphere if you have that excess energy^1 and use it to grow plants where they previously couldn't be grown. Then you can build cities in the desert rather than destroying forests. If you ditch proof-of-work you lose the ability to monetize that energy production and have no sustainable way to fund that project....1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator

Great comments, best of luck.

TLDR please....

Some day you might appreciate the irony of using an apostasy framing to decry another's perspective as religion. ;)..When I first got involved I was pretty agnostic on climate stuff, reading Bjorn Lomborg and the like. I presumed there was probably some reality to CC, but it was overblown and the impacts would be more than offset by economic development...Since then, I've become more grounded in the biophysical reality of our situation, and developed a better understanding of commons. Not to get into it too deeply, but the two most salient points to me are:..1. You can't expect to burn an enormous stock of stored solar energy that was accumulated over a geologic time scale in the span of a few hundred years, and not expect there to be significant consequences. The implications of "the Carbon Pulse" we're living through, at Nate Hagens puts it, are significant both for the environmental livability of the planet, as well as for long-term energy planning for our civilization..2. When humans comprise a small portion of an ecosystem, we can ignore externalities because said ecosystem has the capacity to process waste/restock fish, etc. A small tribe shitting in the lake they live next to is a drop in the proverbial bucket. A giant city there means that all of the "ecosystem services" have been displaced to increase human carrying capacity, and dumping the enormous stream of raw sewage into the lake would be catestrophic. The atmospheric commons follows the same logic. If we are going to sustainably be the dominant life-form on the planet, we can't rely on other life-forms to clean up our waste (shit, CO2, etc.) on their own, but instead need to deal with our own messes one way or the other. That can look like proactively taking responsibility, or degrading the commons to the point where we are poorer and can support the existence of fewer humans.

Wow calling Ethereum 'shitcoin'  seems like Ethereum is groundbreaking and bitcoin is stuck in the stone age.
2
Like all people, they are either unaware or pretend it didn’t happen
3
I was skeptical of it when I first started vaguely following ETH a decade or so ago in terms of fairness, but have come to see the 50 coins per block of the early days of Bitcoin as playing a similar role. Any such system needs mechanisms in the launch phase to capitalize development work, network effect, etc., so it's not something I particularly lose sleep over.
1
Yeah, this is good, much shorter, articulation of a big element of the realization I've come to this month...
2
The only problem is that you get one joule 5 times cheaper than me.
1
As trust is something inherently embedded in human relationships, I've come to see the ideal of mathematically perfect "trustlessness" as something with diminishing returns as you approach the asymtote. At a certain point, the marginal cost of going from 99.999% certain to 99.9999% certain becomes enormous, and you can use knowledge of human psychology and sociology to augment the trust of systems without needing to burn huge amounts of energy for that last ten-thousandths of a percent...One of the things that has come to worry me about Bitcoin is that its myopia on this front leads it to become a [Paperclip Maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer) in which it uses an economic incentive system to drive enormous energy consumption for increasingly minescule marginal improvements that not only provide little-to-no additional socetial value, but also crowd out more productive uses for said energy.

There are many aspects of carbon nonsense. ..One is to believe that the solution is to use less energy. On the contrary, in general, more energy is what people need to solve problems. This nonsense is what I criticize about your OP, where you praise Ethereum for PoS because of that. It's complete nonsense. OK, perhaps we can agree that nuclear energy is better than coal. Happy with that, let's go there and replace all coal with nuclear. Somehow the climate activists are usually against nuclear (perhaps not you though, well I hope not you). This is a red flag, it highly suggests that there is something else going on. ..Another aspect is thinking that some changes in human actions are going to change the trend. That was proven false during last 5 years (remember COVID, right?)...Another aspect is believing that the climate change (whether or not caused by human) leads to some disaster. Notably, alarmists were proven wrong every five years for last 50 years or more in their predictions...Another aspect is that if someone is pushing solar/wind and at the same time does not recognize how Bitcoin helps grids that need to work under erratic supply from those sources .....And many others ...

> You can't expect to burn an enormous stock of stored solar energy..Small sidenote: the stored energy isn't really the problem. That's just the direct heat from the fire. It feels like a lot when you are standing close to the fire, but it's surprisingly much smaller than the atmospheric heating effect of the released carbon dioxide. ..The indirect heating effect is estimated to be somewhere between [100](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008GL036465) and [100,000(!)](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/fossil-fuels-heat-climate-dramatically-19062) times as high as the effect of the directly released heat. ..So if you could release the energy stored in a lump of coal without releasing any of the CO2, it would be great - even if you released it as heat.  .On the other hand, if you somehow released all the CO2 from that coal without generating any (direct) heat, that would still be almost exactly as bad as burning it from a climate change perspective.

If a shitcoin sounds appealing to you as groundbreaking, then sure. The rest of us will stay with the most relevant technology of our time.
3
Ex Eth Miner and I can also agree that it has been relegated to shitcoin since moving to POS.

It was enormous and it was clearly unfair.  I can't see any use for all of the extra bells and whistles of ETH.  See you around.

You mistake energy's price and token represents an energy. There is a concept about energy gain factor.  Assuming the factor is 25 and one token means 1 joule, the energy's price could be as low to 0.04 token or as high to 1 token based on market condition.  Then you see this mindset is adopted by Kardashev who classifies civilization scale or by central banks who eagerly try to stabilize energy price.
1
The demand for trust is determined by the society structure.  Say, assume a future where everyone is basically "Robinson Crusoe" who fills his need by his own, then there is little demand for trust tokens aka money; each person still need some battery banks and book-keeping his own energy usage, though.  For a highly cooperative/social economy, trust market is like other fundamental markets like transportation, recreation,  ..etc, you can safely assume its size expands or shrinks based on the whole economy size which is expressed in terms of total energy consumption and the money is like an energy accounting system.  That said, as energy gain factor could improve by technology, the percentage of energy consumption of trust market could become lower while the absolute energy consumption becomes higher...Keep in mind, as trust is the cost to rollback/attack the commitment and cost is expressed in terms of energy.  There is no way "human psychology and sociology to augment the trust of systems" which is pretty much like what governments want people to believe their fiats, and as said, that approach will go sour inevitably.  Of course, the "sour" can only be felt by the non PWTB and their friends.

I'm with you on nuclear - while presenting some risks, it's the only non-fossil solar (if you don't count how everything heavier than helium was forged in a supernova at some point) energy source that could come close to providing enough power to maintain or grow our civilization. How long it can buy us will be determined by the EROI - as the easy to access stocks are depleted, we bump back into limits, but a crash program would definitely buy us time and should happen...As to whether or not climate science has panned out in the past few decades, you and I clearly have different epistemological standards and sources, so probably aren't going to convince each other. That said, from my thought-out, formerly skeptical position, all I see in the denialist camp is tribalist cope as the sea-surface temperature charts march in one direction for very clear reasons...The tragedy to me is that there was a window in the late 80s/early 90s after [Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp-WiNXH6hI) testified to Congress when a small, gradually escalating carbon tax could have made climate change a historical footnote like the Montreal Protocol made the Ozone Hole in a gradualist, mostly painless way. But then companies with significant FF assets took a page out of the Tobacco PR playbook, and here we are... :(

"more energy is what people need to solve problems" ???? what does that even mean?  Why doesn't bitcoin move to PoS ???  It would make it sooo much more acceptable.
1
You can name it as you will, you getting your energy 5 times cheaper than me and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
1
I think we will have to stay with nuclear as we won't agree on anything else :)..I am not surprised that someone who praises Ethereum is proposing taxation. This perfectly fits into my image of climate activists, who are mostly just scammers. What scammers want? Other people's money. That's all it is. Ethereum is the same and taxation is the same. What is taxation? It's a legalized theft. It's highly immoral but it's worse than that. It's promoted dishonestly. You know, when you live under control of mafia, at least they are honest - you pay or you get into trouble, there is no pretending. With taxation, it's all about pretending that it's a good and necessary thing...I just can't help it. Every time I try to listen to anyone from carbon hysteria side, they always just want other people's money like every other scammer...I would love to see a single honest person who is on the climate activists side. Someone who does not want to steal from others, is genuine, does not run their own scam, or does not promote scams of other groups associated with that. ..How am I supposed to listen to anything you say if you are promoting taxation? ..The OP suggests, you are not following Bitcoin space very carefully. No problem, sure, but it's a red flag when someone criticizes something they do not follow (like the community of builders on Bitcoin today is awesome, have you been sleeping under a rock?). Second red flag comes with promoting decrease instead of increase of energy consumption in order to solve a problem. Third is not recognizing that PoW is crucial. And fourth, you are proposing taxation (while ignoring that not taxation, but halting half of the whole world for 2 years did not make any change).
2
Because PoS is critically flawed mechanism that is not unlike the current fiat system. One of many flaws, for example, just to be specific, is that if it happens that an attacker ever obtains majority of coins, they can never be defeated. So 51% attack on PoS is a permanent state...As for energy - people always move forward and progress and solve problems by expending more energy. How is this surprising? People can produce more food today than they used to before because they are using more energy. People can protect themselves against attacks better than before because they use more energy. People can travel further and faster than before because they use more energy. People can extract more resources from Earth than before by using more energy...
2
In this scenario, assuming 1.86e+12 joules per bitcoin which you can objectively to estimate as well like others, the price of the same goods of everything in your place, in terms of bitcoin, would be much higher than in my place due to the role of energy price in economy activity.  Also, you might find a solar panel is a worthy set up in this scenario thanks to sun shines on you as well.
1
As I mentioned in OP, I definitely once shared your ideological convictions about taxation. As I've gotten older I've come to see that the "taxation is theft" vulgar libertarian sloganeering represents an extremely simplistic (but self-serving, for certain groups of people) understanding of both value and power...In particular, the most compelling flaw for me lies in the relationship to [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource). If your property's value derives from externalizing costs onto other people, that is a form of taking from them to aggrandize your own wealth. In other words, theft...Because no human being created things like land, the breathable atmosphere, oceans full of fish, etc., fully individualized property rights in them do not make sense from a justice perspective. Rather (and this is the basis of [Geolibertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism)), if anyone wants to take from, or otherwise use the capacity of, a commons, they owe everyone else for the right to do so. The prices for the individual use of the common-pool resources need to be sufficient so they are not over-used, degraded, and exhausted in a Tragedy of the Commons scenario...This can be structured in a variety of ways - for instance, setting limits on the amount that can be taken/emitted in a given year, and [allowing participants to freely trade the license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading) to do so is one more market-based alternative to a set [use tax/universal dividend scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend). Either approach, though, is far superior to allowing the unfettered individual taking of common-pool resources, which to my eyes, far more clearly falls under the rubric of "theft" than such taxation.
2
I live in Ukraine and we have modest prices but our energy sources get bombed by terrorist country.
1
> fully individualized property rights in them do not make sense from a justice perspective..Since we disagree on this, all you build on top of that obviously does not lead us anywhere.
2
>setting limits on the amount that can be taken/emitted in a given year..this is price. The real tragedy of the commons is that the true price of non-nuclear energy is unbearable, so it's been offset into the future.

This scenario is extreme in the context of this comment threads.  In this case even internet and all services based on are not sustainable.  However, the concept that money is an abstraction of energy accounting remains true.  You could still use the battery or peanuts as money to exchange for goods with other people as both are physically energy storage rather than abstractly like bitcoin or gold via the concept of proof-of-energy work sort of mimic float charging.
1
The energy is scarce and I can run an Ether node off of my home reserve power supply coz it is powered by an iPad charger..The energy is scarce and no matter how many bitcoins I have I can’t create energy from the thin air..But I can still run a node cos I have cellular/satellite connection for node..You live in a no problems world, Ether is sustainable in a war situation and is ww3 proof.
1
If you are complaining you don't have enough energy for mining, you can look at my comment reply to the other reditter in this OP.  Actually bitcoin currently has multiple chains and you can choose one easier chain for mining.  As you can still access reddit and I assume your internet is ok, I guess your situation is far from a terrible war scenario I mentioned above (the peanuts money) and I strongly suggest you get a solar panel because on average it provides 342 watt per square meter and I read news that Russia is targeting your energy infrastructure so your iPad charger will be useless soon. ..Did you understand my mentioned logical proof that the proof-of-energy work is the only way out?  Currently eth is proof-of-stake.  If you like that, I can only say either you want to be the new power-that-be of a repeated ugly money history or you really don't have a clue what money is or you are a bot...Sorry, as bot prevention, tell me what is the last digit of (123)\^456 + (789)\^101112 ? if you want to go on the conversation.
1
You are pretty dumb to assume that bot wouldn’t be able to solve junior school math. But it is consistent with the rest of your argument. ..Regarding your first point: you say I install the solar panels for mining but the next thing you say is that I won’t be able to run my iPad charger?..Our energy infrastructure is under attack for ~800 days and we are defending ok while republicans block the funding for us to protect hospitals and schools...You didn’t address any of my points and just plain stated that your proof is right but I clearly showed to you that:.1) energy is scarce .2) wasting it on mining is dumb

the vast majority of social securities are impossible under a bitcoin standard...as nayib bukele pointed out this week, government largely funds itself through money printing (not taxation). next, look at how much of annual government expenditure the nhs accounts for in the uk as an example. and you will quickly see a bitcoin standard kills big government. hence, why libertarians like bitcoin...and as other posters have pointed out, why a leftie who understands bitcoin, would not like it... it take away their ability to expropriate others' wealth. it takes away their ability to play god with other's labour, and hard earned wealth.

It’s not chaos at all . By letting the market decide what has actually value and what no , you have the best people and services to serve the community with their advancements . By contrasts , relying on a central entity leads to magnify human flaws in terms of what is valuable and what is not . Atm we should start with a limited state which just sets the boundaries , takes care of people in need , and let the free market thrive . In the following decades we could also have a “decentralized network state “ , but it’s a bit too early now

Hans-Hermann Hoppe is libertarian, technically.  But he is on the far right of libertarian thought.  ...Most libertarians are much more accepting of people's difference.  ...One can have libertarians who are not accepting ... in that they are not friendly with those with whom they disagree ... just as you can have liberals who are not accepting of those with whom they disagree.  ...A libertarian, however, unlike a liberal, must be TOLERANT of those of whom the disagree, and failing this, they cease to be libertarian ipso facto.  ...In order to understand the difference, you have to understand the difference between tolerance and acceptance.  ...If I accept you, I think you're just fine, your presence does not annoy you, and I am generally nice to you.  ...If I tolerate you, on the other hand, I may not be as polite, I may let you know that I don't like you ... but yet in order to remain libertarian, I must none the less refrain from violating your rights, or advocating that the government or anyone else violate your rights on my behalf.  ...I, personally, am accepting of nearly all people, to the best of my ability.  If you make a habit of demeaning or insulting me, or if you do things that are just nasty, like using the n-word in anger ( as opposed to the way that rappers might use the soft-r form), or "shaming" people for their sexuality, then that acceptance might devolve into mere tolerance.  I will won't violate your rights, I won't harm you or advocate that others harm you ( in theory, I'm human, I \*COULD\* lose my temper and assault you ... but I'm 55 and I haven't done that since I was a child and did not know better, so you're pretty safe with me ).  ...What I may not tolerate, probably WILL NOT tolerate, unless I am simply out-manned and outgunned and unwilling to die on that hill, is people who fail to tolerate peaceful people.  If you insult people, I won't physically stop you, but I may tell you you are an asshole and I don't approve of your behavior.  If your reasons for doing so are particularly bad ( e.g. racism, homophobia, etc) then I will probably tell you more loudly.   ...If you actually initiate force against people, then I reserve the right to put a stop to it, by any means necessary.   I may not do so .... I don't owe anybody free security services, but I may well.  If I fell that person has brought the situation on themselves, e.g. shouting hard-r's in Harlem, I am much less likely to choose to help you.

You do not have to be a libertarian to like Bitcoin. However, it implies that you lack knowledge on the subject, which is not uncommon, but it is great if you realize it and try to fix it...> Is this the way to go?..yes..>  Is it a good idea to have no state and organize everything by the "market"? ..yes..> Social Darwinism?..that's something else..> Does this kind of thinking really provide more freedom/benefits for the people?..yes..> For me, it sounds like chaos..That is common. Just think about how you perceive a word "anarchy". It is not unlikely that if you come from where masses are, you watch some TV and the word "anarchy" is put as a synonym for chaos and pictures show anarcho-communist (or similar) people destroying property of their capitalist enemies...But anarchy does not mean anarcho-communism. Anarchy means only "no state". Only if you combine that with something like communism, you can get that picture that is presented to you as anarchy. ..But what libertarians envision is anarcho-capitalism, which is nothing like anarcho-communism (or similar) except that they both look for "no state"...>  the informed early adopter will form an Elite..There is such super advantage of early adopters on the free market. On the free market, even if you are first and do good, if you change that and stop providing the best available service to the market, someone else will beat you...> I also realized that libertarian economists like Hans-Hermann Hoppe are connected to far right parties like the German AFD...I don't know about that. May or may not be true, would be surprising to me, but would not matter. Since we are for "no state", there are no political parties to support, except perhaps during transition for parties that would strictly cancel regulations one by one...> As European, a government without social securities (healthcare/education/ unemployment benefit/...) sounds like survival of the fittest...Understandably, as you are fed this idea since you are a baby. One random hint here - there is no (involuntary) unemployment in the free market...> What are your thoughts?..Read a book or two, expand your knowledge, fill your gaps.

Libertarianism is not the same as anarchism (belief that a stateless society is best). Also, many libertarians hate Hans-Hermann Hoppe. Myself included. ..Libertarianism is simply the idea that freedoms are good and we should maximize them. It takes both the social freedom aspects of leftists and the fiscal freedom aspects of the right. However, most libertarians belive that there is some good amount of government, just that it is less than what we currently have in most countries.
2
If anything history has taught us anything it is that country’s/civilizations/governments that utilize fiat currency fail.  Over and over , every time they debase the currency to cover over expansion growing beyond their means. ..To understand BTC you must understand money. ..Once you understand money you will  see that more government means more money printing. We are at war with Covid, Carbon, The Russians , terrorism and whatever comes next. ..We will see the expansion of weaponizing USD , increasing deficit spending by the US government regardless who wins the election, this leads many to feel that it is just a matter of time before a crisis forces a reset or a paradigm shift. ..The USD is the reserve currency for the world except for bad countries but continues to debaseUSD,   the effect is spread world wide. Now treasury bonds don’t sell so good and more countries seek gold   ..We are here in this particular time with many emerging technologies neural link,  AI , BTC, automation , any many undisclosed technologies still being developed will form the future just as fire, iron the wheel. ..Government is a necessary evil, hopefully someday we can break the chains  of fiat. ..Imagine a day with no inflation and if you fight a war you have to do it with the funds you have , not debase the value of everything else.

Libertarians will adopt Bitcoin because they like it..Statists / authoritarians will adopt Bitcoin out of necessity. They will hate it, but if you want to survive, you do what you've got to do.

Libertarianism is not "anti-government". You're thinking of anarchism (which could be considered a subset of libertarianism). Libertarians usually hold the view that there are several important things a government should do (usually defense, policing, and dispute resolution are the main ones), and that governments should basically not do more than those things. ..>  it sounds like chaos..It doesn't sound like you know much about libertarian thinking. The founding fathers in the US could have all been considered libertarian. In fact the term "liberals" described people that were basically libertarians until the 1920s when the great depression for some reason shifted people who self-described as "liberals" into meaning something rather more socialist leaning, where government would help struggling people and help fix the economy. This is not what liberalism meant for hundreds of years...In any case, my favorite economist that talks about libertarianism and even anarchism is David Friedman (son of the famous Milton Friedman). He often writes about the more nuanced things in the space and isn't at all dogmatic about libertarianism. Check out some of his writing on libertariansism here: http://daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Libertarian.html..>  libertarian economists like Hans-Hermann Hoppe..Hoppe is far right even in the libertarian sphere. I read one of his book and I thought it was hateful shit...But to answer your main question, you don't have to be libertarian to like bitcoin, but it does tend to go hand in hand. The mainstream modern opinion is that governments should operate currencies. Why they should isn't really made clear. The whole idea of having a non-national currency is somewhat antagonistic to mainstream statists who think the government should do that. So if you're in favor of a bitcoin world where bitcoin *replaces* national currencies, you might have a bit of libertarianism in you after all.

You don't have to be Libertarian to get Bitcoin, in fact, IMO libertarian Bitcoiners lost the plot long ago...You can believe whatever you want, Bitcoin is just Bitcoin, you could as well be a communist and like it...And while it's true that many maxis are larpertarians, that doesn't make everyone (not even all maxis) libertarians. Many maxis believe that Bitcoin is some kind of godsent asset that validates their lifestyles, and that is not the case...  .I think you'd like to give a read to this article as well: [Occupy Bitcoin: Bitcoin Is Not Just Libertarian](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/occupy-bitcoin-bitcoin-is-not-just-libertarian)

Bitcoin maxis think that monopoly is possible on a free market.  ...That is a decidedly unlibertarian view, and also flyies in the face of everything we know about economic law.  ...The only way to maintain a monopoly or cartel is through naked, brutal force.  ...The war on drugs, for example, is the government defending Big Pharma's turf from  competition.  ...And it's not working very well.

Twitter is full of these lunatics claiming that a bitcoin is going to be worth 1/21,000,000th of the universe, because it will be the only thing of value and the only way to trade...  .Which means that they are either completely unacquainted with the laws of economics, or they are planning to get the governments help maintaining their monopoly the way they did for Bit Pharma and do for Big Banking, or they are engaged in a pattern of really blatant fraud.

There's a good reason to believe that bitcoin will eventually eat the majority of a number of classes of assets. Gold + silver + government bonds + corporate bonds +  derivatives + national currencies + credit card credit = $300 trillion to $900 trillion. This doesn't count real estate or stocks or household debt among other things. ..Why would it eat the majority of those asset classes? Because bitcoin has superior qualities to all of them. Its cheaper to store than gold and silver (and most assets that require a custodian). Its far easier to verify and transfer than gold and silver. As an aside, only about 10% of the value of gold and silver is related to its physical uses, and the other 90% is because of their uses as stores of value. It is likely to appreciate faster than bonds and low-value derivatives. It doesn't bleed value like fiat currencies. Its cheaper to spend than credit card credit (by about 6X not including interest payment gotchas). [Read this for more details](https://governology.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/so-you-want-to-understand-bitcoin-part-1/)..So if bitcoin eats 50% of all of those things, that's about $100 trillion of value on the low end. That leads to a future price at that equilibrium of over $7 million per bitcoin. Only 10% of those things? That's still a $1.4 million bitcoin. ..There needs to be no monopoly for bitcoin to succeed in this way. Bitcoin has numerous beneficial qualities that give it a competitive advantage over all those assets for many people in many cases.

Title: Initial Investigation into Miner Collusion

Dude, if folks want to write whatever they want to write into the blockchain and pay for it, that's precisely what it's there for.  You have no idea behind the motivation, or what makes it worthwhile.  To them.  And you have no right to impose your definition of what is "worthless" on other people...That is, in fact, the whole point of a censorship-free network...Individuals can determine value for themselves, and transact in that value, irrespective of the values held by others.  Yourself included.

Going theaters for some movie, some "smart-that-be" introduced an accounting hack so that the fee by way of entrance1 is artificially lower than the fee by way of entrance2.  Then another "smart-that-be" plan to raise the fee rate by way of entrance1 to counteract the effect.  What a mess.  The average Joe that just likes to arbitrage the fee shall not be blamed and the world would be much simpler without those "smart-that-be".

If you are a small or mid-sized miner who is receiving less revenue from your pool because your pool is spending resources pumping the price of transactions, then it would be worthwhile for you to switch to a pool that does not pump...Not only is this digital drug abuse, this is also mistreating people who use the block chain.  An intervention would be helpful.

Perhaps someone could offer a logical explanation as to why you think his supposition is "dumb."  He's not wrong about what ETFs did with gold, ie giving out more shares of gold than gold exists.  Nor is he wrong that they will do the same with Bitcoin, ie give out more shares of Bitcoin than the Bitcoin these ETFs actually possess...I neither believe nor disbelieve that this inflated imaginary amount of Bitcoin will affect the actual existing quantity of Bitcoin, but it seems worthy of discussion/consideration.

What a waste of a video to watch.  Ugh.

Yeap, my only fear is that the lesson isn’t learned until after a massive amount of bitcoin is locked into these highly regulated custodial accounts. At a certain point, that becomes an existential issue, as it diminishes Bitcoin’s censorship resistance greatly.
2
Let’s hope not. I think the underlying asset is solid but the fuckery of wall st knows no bounds. Synthetic assets on synthetic assets. Invest answers did a good video on YouTube channel today exploring what’s happening. I liked his insights.

The one difference is the ability to transact buy and sell bitcoin without going through any brokerage or even a centralized entity at all...They can make fake bitcoin and you bet will. But there is actually a built in balance to the fraud which is just owning your own coin. So I truly believe that will keep the abusive short selling a bit in check compared to normal securities or even gold backed securities.
2
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Therefore 21 million is arbitrary. It takes just as many resources to send 1 bitcoin as it does .00000000000000000001 bitcoin. Physically, it doesnt matter if you own 1 billion or 1 billionth of a bitcoin. They take up the same space. With that said, there is no physical limitation with bitcoin so inflation and deflation has no real effect on its function or capacity. With fiat, you can't get lower than a penny but with digital currency you can get infinitely small. So what does all this mean. It means that a pizza could cost 100 bitcoin or .0000001 bitcoin depending on the arbitrarily assigned value. Either way, it takes the same pizza and same effort on the blockchain no matter what the arbitrary number is valued at. All that to say, hyperinflation has zero effect on the actual function of bitcoin. Only its value. Even then, people will just use .00000001 instead of 1 bitcoin. Makes no difference.
1
It doesn't really make a difference for censorship resistance. The ETFs are already maximally censored in that sense. anyone who buys them already expects to be maximally censored, so anyone who cares about that, won't touch them and no-one will accept them for payment, because they can't.
0
I'm leaning toward your viewpoint, the more thought I give it,  what this guy is predicting would probably only come about if the government attempted to commandeer and control Bitcoin, as they did with gold, and that effort would be likely to fail due to Bitcoin's very nature.  At first glance this guy made a convincing case, because what he describes is what ETFs will undoubtedly do.  Thanks for the reply.
1
It *absolutely* can make a difference in terms of censorship resistance- consider the economic weight of a node when faced with a network soft-forking situation. If a huge number of coins are locked into a regulated custodial account, then that custodian’s node will start to have a larger say in the outcome of such forks. ..You aren’t just giving them your coins to hold, you’re also *giving them the ability to influence the rules that govern your coins*!
1
I don't think you understand what a soft fork does. Soft fork can't \*change\* the rules. That'd be a hard fork. Soft fork can \*only add \*\*optional\*\* new rules\*. Anyone who doesn't like the effects of those new rules can opt to just not use them and stick to doing transactions according to the old rules instead and be unaffected by the new rules...A soft fork is meaningless unless the rules it adds start getting significant usage.
1
I understand well what a soft fork can do, and it can indeed effectively ‘change’ the rules. It may help to consider that a soft fork can be described as a restriction of the consensus rules. ..Some of what you wrote isn’t correct in the extreme case. Consider a situation in which regulated custodians have enough economic weight to enforce a new rule that says coins can only be sent to whitelisted addresses. This would be a soft fork by definition, and it would affect all UTXO holders, whether or not they like it. (This assumes a majority of miners enforce the new rule, but that is game-theoretically implied by the term ‘economic majority’ in these discussions). ..Don’t let your guard down just because something is a ‘soft fork’. I can’t seem to find it now, but there is a good article/talk out there somewhere from one of the core maintainers, about how basically *any* change can be pushed as a soft fork if you do it in a clever enough way.
1
The scenario you're describing is one where miners have done a hard fork, which would materialize the moment a non-compliant miner produces a block that includes any transaction that doesn't follow the changed rule...A soft fork is only a soft fork if it doesn't make any block or transaction invalid, that would be valid with a previous version. It's a hard fork if it changes things like this.
1
Nope it’s more of a grey area than that- the fork I described wouldn’t make anything invalid in the view of any nodes on the network. Transactions paying to non-whitelist addresses would still be valid, they just wouldn’t ever be confirmed in the most-work chain. ..Old nodes would happily follow along with the new-rule blocks, which means it wouldn’t be a hard fork. A hard fork introduces something that old nodes will see as invalid, which the above scenario does not. ..(Semantics of hard/soft fork aside, I hope this helps to highlight the dangers of locking large numbers of coins into regulated accounts).
1
What you described is a hostile miner led takeover attempt of Bitcoin. Nothing, whatsoever, to do with an ETF. The people who don't like the new rules, will pick the first block that's invalid with respect to the "new" rules and hardcode that to be a required block in the full node software and continue the chain from there. Market will decide how much value each part of the network will end up having...The only effect the ETFs could have on this process is to affect how much value finally ends up on each fork, but even that is a coin toss because both forks would become less valuable, which could well trigger mass exits from the ETFs overall, which would further reduce the overall market value of both forks to total much less than the original chain had...That last part is why I doubt the ETFs would want to start playing dumb games.
1
Having an ‘economic majority’ of full nodes backing such a thing is exactly what could embolden miners to sign on to participate. Cronyism and politic-ing amongst regulated entities is inevitable. The issue is the centralization of power. ..(Also fwiw, hardcoding a block to ignore the attacking majority is not really a viable solution. If you replace the consensus mechanism with politics, that only means the consensus mechanism itself has failed).
1
Yes, if the scenario you're talking about were to actually happen, it'd be a failure of the consensus mechanism...This is one of the potential weaknesses of the blockchain model. It can only stay unchanged and keep it's full value if a big enough portion of the market wants it to stay that way...The attack you were talking about with regard to the ETFs is of the bait and switch type. First they offer investment vehicle into Bitcoin, then once they have enough "mass", they'd proceed to convert them into coins in an inferior altcoin while pretending it's still the original Bitcoin. Even going so far as attempting to kill the original Bitcoin in the process...That said, ultimately, the ETFs are just middle men. Whether such an attack succeeds depends on the whole market and the influence of the ETFs can easily end up cut off if enough of the ETF's customers figure out what's going on and decide they don't like it...It's not really a technical issue. It's a social one. One of the cornerstones of Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is the assumption that the market, as a whole, would prefer Bitcoin as an open platform only regulated by it's own consensus rules...The situation you're talking about can only come to pass if a large majority of investment into Bitcoin comes from people and organizations who are oblivious to what made Bitcoin valuable in the first place.

Title: Lightning Network

Did I read somewhere that lightning network is going to stop 🛑? Or maybe only on a certain platform is going to stop using it? Sorry for this poor question.
2
Mostly. But the lightning network is fully secure *unless* fees suddenly get huge and stays huge for a long time. If fees slowly get larger and larger, this isn't a problem. So while yes, there's a higher probability of losing money with LN than onchain, the probability is still so small that its not really significant.

Title: How does bitcoin tackle any flaws in the underlying code/hardware it resides on to keep it being secure?
1
Bitcoin is updated all the time, but it's also designed to be very backwards compatible. I was running a node from 2021 without any updates and it still runs and communicates with the network just fine, and you can check online and see there are even older nodes connected to the network. But there is always a risk in running older code because there might be something major that was updated that might fuck me over later.
3
The Bitcoin protocol, compared with many newer cryptos, is pretty basic and no major issues have been found for a long time...That said, if an issue was found, a proposed fix can be put forward, and then it's up to miners and pools to either accept the revision or not. If enough of the network accept the new codebase, the protocol is updated and non-conforming miners are excluded until such time they update...This is known as a fork, and usually the old protocol simply dies as no one uses it anymore. But sometimes we see old protocols kept alive by a smaller subset of minors (normally on ideological grounds), and these essentially become alt-coins such as Bitcoin Cash etc. ..Holders are not impacted, as unless the underlying hashing processes were changed, legacy coins remain perfectly accessible on the updated chain...Bitcoin has undergone many of these updates in its life, and generally they are very uneventful...Again, Bitcoin is a pretty basic protocol so the following is unlikely, but if something catastrophic happened and it was too late for a fix, that gets more complex. Miners would still have to agree on a fix, but you then run into questions or rollbacks, which fundamentally goes against the Bitcoin ideology. Eth had this happen back in 2014 (?) with the Dao failure, which caused lots of issues and nearly destroyed Eth...I'm not sure Eth or Bitcoin would survive such an event now it's a far more mature economy. But equally the chance of exploits being found on a decades old protocol becomes less and less.
2
Things are being patched all the time in Bitcoin...The question seems really vague to me, could you explain it a little better? Seems like you don't completely understand what you actually want to ask, so if you can add as much information as you can, better, that way we can also know where you're just confused and you're actually concerned.

The problem is that you will end up downloading and validating Ordinals regardless since the data is embeded into the tx, so once validated by a miner, it lives in your UTXO, whether you filter it beforehand or not, valid block are valid blocks...You could apply the same modifications that Knots applies so you dont relay that data (clearing your mempool from Ordinals and possibly footguning your own fee estimation), or run Knots directly (I wouldn't recommend that), but valid blocks are valid blocks, so expect to live with that data whether you like it or not.

Bitcoin is the idea, a peer to peer currency. .But:.- mining is only profitable for some, after the halving only those with access to the cheapest energy will keep mining..- while my Ethereum node runs off the iPad charger..- doesn’t support smart accounts, with social recovery. I sleep well knowing if fire occurs or I lose my passphrase, I won’t lose my life savings..- I can quickly swap my tokens to basically any other token on the planet with instant speed and sub-cent fees on L2 of my choice..- I can and did write smart contracts with real world usage...My first crypto was Bitcoin. Sadly, it was a decade ago and since then, no advancements in technology were made..While Ethereum keeps improving year on year...Bitcoin is the idea. Ethereum is execution.
3
The reason that it seems only big mining farm or heavily-invested miners can now play the mining game is that it is difficult to distribute a tiny share of block reward in small blocks.  You could play the mining game if your "USB mining chip" is as efficient as those of other heavy-invested miners and the block is big...The proof-of-energy-work is essential as you could use the same amount of energy to boil the same amount of water even with advanced heating technology in a far future.  Energy is the universal accounting basis so it is the best measurement of cost.  Trust must be maintained and manufactured and cannot come from thin air as trust is the cost to rollback the commitment.  If you think some proof-of-X works, you re-run the ugly history of a bad money system.  In ideal proof-of-energy-work, you sacrifice 1 joule to get 1 joule trust.  In a proof-of-X system, if you only spend, opaquely and equivalently, 0.2 joule to get 1 joule trust, there is a gap of 0.8 joule for rent-seekers and the proof-of-X system will go sour someday somewhere somehow by someone for sure.

> Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake also deals with the somewhat dystopian energy-use reality of PoW mining in a world where energy consumption is one of the existential questions for our species...That transition to PoS shows the project is captured and centralized and not worth anyone's time. It's just another company, which is fine if you want to buy stock in a company, but it's not what they advertise...> If the only way to secure a network to your satisfaction is to burn so much energy that it pushes the world towards one of the more horrifying climate models, one should question whether such true trustlessness is desirable..By tying money to energy it encourages finding new energy sources. The cost of energy goes down exponentially in bitcoin terms. With low cost of energy, many applications like desalination become economically viable....Deserts have lots of solar energy and little cloud coverage. You can recoup the costs of deploying a solar farm in the desert where there are no people around to pay for it otherwise by mining bitcoin. You can pull water out of the atmosphere if you have that excess energy^1 and use it to grow plants where they previously couldn't be grown. Then you can build cities in the desert rather than destroying forests. If you ditch proof-of-work you lose the ability to monetize that energy production and have no sustainable way to fund that project....1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator

TLDR please....

Some day you might appreciate the irony of using an apostasy framing to decry another's perspective as religion. ;)..When I first got involved I was pretty agnostic on climate stuff, reading Bjorn Lomborg and the like. I presumed there was probably some reality to CC, but it was overblown and the impacts would be more than offset by economic development...Since then, I've become more grounded in the biophysical reality of our situation, and developed a better understanding of commons. Not to get into it too deeply, but the two most salient points to me are:..1. You can't expect to burn an enormous stock of stored solar energy that was accumulated over a geologic time scale in the span of a few hundred years, and not expect there to be significant consequences. The implications of "the Carbon Pulse" we're living through, at Nate Hagens puts it, are significant both for the environmental livability of the planet, as well as for long-term energy planning for our civilization..2. When humans comprise a small portion of an ecosystem, we can ignore externalities because said ecosystem has the capacity to process waste/restock fish, etc. A small tribe shitting in the lake they live next to is a drop in the proverbial bucket. A giant city there means that all of the "ecosystem services" have been displaced to increase human carrying capacity, and dumping the enormous stream of raw sewage into the lake would be catestrophic. The atmospheric commons follows the same logic. If we are going to sustainably be the dominant life-form on the planet, we can't rely on other life-forms to clean up our waste (shit, CO2, etc.) on their own, but instead need to deal with our own messes one way or the other. That can look like proactively taking responsibility, or degrading the commons to the point where we are poorer and can support the existence of fewer humans.

Wow calling Ethereum 'shitcoin'  seems like Ethereum is groundbreaking and bitcoin is stuck in the stone age.
2
Like all people, they are either unaware or pretend it didn’t happen
3
I was skeptical of it when I first started vaguely following ETH a decade or so ago in terms of fairness, but have come to see the 50 coins per block of the early days of Bitcoin as playing a similar role. Any such system needs mechanisms in the launch phase to capitalize development work, network effect, etc., so it's not something I particularly lose sleep over.

Yeah, this is good, much shorter, articulation of a big element of the realization I've come to this month...

The only problem is that you get one joule 5 times cheaper than me.

As trust is something inherently embedded in human relationships, I've come to see the ideal of mathematically perfect "trustlessness" as something with diminishing returns as you approach the asymtote. At a certain point, the marginal cost of going from 99.999% certain to 99.9999% certain becomes enormous, and you can use knowledge of human psychology and sociology to augment the trust of systems without needing to burn huge amounts of energy for that last ten-thousandths of a percent...One of the things that has come to worry me about Bitcoin is that its myopia on this front leads it to become a [Paperclip Maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer) in which it uses an economic incentive system to drive enormous energy consumption for increasingly minescule marginal improvements that not only provide little-to-no additional socetial value, but also crowd out more productive uses for said energy.

There are many aspects of carbon nonsense. ..One is to believe that the solution is to use less energy. On the contrary, in general, more energy is what people need to solve problems. This nonsense is what I criticize about your OP, where you praise Ethereum for PoS because of that. It's complete nonsense. OK, perhaps we can agree that nuclear energy is better than coal. Happy with that, let's go there and replace all coal with nuclear. Somehow the climate activists are usually against nuclear (perhaps not you though, well I hope not you). This is a red flag, it highly suggests that there is something else going on. ..Another aspect is thinking that some changes in human actions are going to change the trend. That was proven false during last 5 years (remember COVID, right?)...Another aspect is believing that the climate change (whether or not caused by human) leads to some disaster. Notably, alarmists were proven wrong every five years for last 50 years or more in their predictions...Another aspect is that if someone is pushing solar/wind and at the same time does not recognize how Bitcoin helps grids that need to work under erratic supply from those sources .....And many others ...
3
> You can't expect to burn an enormous stock of stored solar energy..Small sidenote: the stored energy isn't really the problem. That's just the direct heat from the fire. It feels like a lot when you are standing close to the fire, but it's surprisingly much smaller than the atmospheric heating effect of the released carbon dioxide. ..The indirect heating effect is estimated to be somewhere between [100](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008GL036465) and [100,000(!)](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/fossil-fuels-heat-climate-dramatically-19062) times as high as the effect of the directly released heat. ..So if you could release the energy stored in a lump of coal without releasing any of the CO2, it would be great - even if you released it as heat.  .On the other hand, if you somehow released all the CO2 from that coal without generating any (direct) heat, that would still be almost exactly as bad as burning it from a climate change perspective.

If a shitcoin sounds appealing to you as groundbreaking, then sure. The rest of us will stay with the most relevant technology of our time.

Ex Eth Miner and I can also agree that it has been relegated to shitcoin since moving to POS.

It was enormous and it was clearly unfair.  I can't see any use for all of the extra bells and whistles of ETH.  See you around.

You mistake energy's price and token represents an energy. There is a concept about energy gain factor.  Assuming the factor is 25 and one token means 1 joule, the energy's price could be as low to 0.04 token or as high to 1 token based on market condition.  Then you see this mindset is adopted by Kardashev who classifies civilization scale or by central banks who eagerly try to stabilize energy price.
1
The demand for trust is determined by the society structure.  Say, assume a future where everyone is basically "Robinson Crusoe" who fills his need by his own, then there is little demand for trust tokens aka money; each person still need some battery banks and book-keeping his own energy usage, though.  For a highly cooperative/social economy, trust market is like other fundamental markets like transportation, recreation,  ..etc, you can safely assume its size expands or shrinks based on the whole economy size which is expressed in terms of total energy consumption and the money is like an energy accounting system.  That said, as energy gain factor could improve by technology, the percentage of energy consumption of trust market could become lower while the absolute energy consumption becomes higher...Keep in mind, as trust is the cost to rollback/attack the commitment and cost is expressed in terms of energy.  There is no way "human psychology and sociology to augment the trust of systems" which is pretty much like what governments want people to believe their fiats, and as said, that approach will go sour inevitably.  Of course, the "sour" can only be felt by the non PWTB and their friends.

I'm with you on nuclear - while presenting some risks, it's the only non-fossil solar (if you don't count how everything heavier than helium was forged in a supernova at some point) energy source that could come close to providing enough power to maintain or grow our civilization. How long it can buy us will be determined by the EROI - as the easy to access stocks are depleted, we bump back into limits, but a crash program would definitely buy us time and should happen...As to whether or not climate science has panned out in the past few decades, you and I clearly have different epistemological standards and sources, so probably aren't going to convince each other. That said, from my thought-out, formerly skeptical position, all I see in the denialist camp is tribalist cope as the sea-surface temperature charts march in one direction for very clear reasons...The tragedy to me is that there was a window in the late 80s/early 90s after [Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp-WiNXH6hI) testified to Congress when a small, gradually escalating carbon tax could have made climate change a historical footnote like the Montreal Protocol made the Ozone Hole in a gradualist, mostly painless way. But then companies with significant FF assets took a page out of the Tobacco PR playbook, and here we are... :(

"more energy is what people need to solve problems" ???? what does that even mean?  Why doesn't bitcoin move to PoS ???  It would make it sooo much more acceptable.

You can name it as you will, you getting your energy 5 times cheaper than me and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

I think we will have to stay with nuclear as we won't agree on anything else :)..I am not surprised that someone who praises Ethereum is proposing taxation. This perfectly fits into my image of climate activists, who are mostly just scammers. What scammers want? Other people's money. That's all it is. Ethereum is the same and taxation is the same. What is taxation? It's a legalized theft. It's highly immoral but it's worse than that. It's promoted dishonestly. You know, when you live under control of mafia, at least they are honest - you pay or you get into trouble, there is no pretending. With taxation, it's all about pretending that it's a good and necessary thing...I just can't help it. Every time I try to listen to anyone from carbon hysteria side, they always just want other people's money like every other scammer...I would love to see a single honest person who is on the climate activists side. Someone who does not want to steal from others, is genuine, does not run their own scam, or does not promote scams of other groups associated with that. ..How am I supposed to listen to anything you say if you are promoting taxation? ..The OP suggests, you are not following Bitcoin space very carefully. No problem, sure, but it's a red flag when someone criticizes something they do not follow (like the community of builders on Bitcoin today is awesome, have you been sleeping under a rock?). Second red flag comes with promoting decrease instead of increase of energy consumption in order to solve a problem. Third is not recognizing that PoW is crucial. And fourth, you are proposing taxation (while ignoring that not taxation, but halting half of the whole world for 2 years did not make any change).
2
Because PoS is critically flawed mechanism that is not unlike the current fiat system. One of many flaws, for example, just to be specific, is that if it happens that an attacker ever obtains majority of coins, they can never be defeated. So 51% attack on PoS is a permanent state...As for energy - people always move forward and progress and solve problems by expending more energy. How is this surprising? People can produce more food today than they used to before because they are using more energy. People can protect themselves against attacks better than before because they use more energy. People can travel further and faster than before because they use more energy. People can extract more resources from Earth than before by using more energy...
2
In this scenario, assuming 1.86e+12 joules per bitcoin which you can objectively to estimate as well like others, the price of the same goods of everything in your place, in terms of bitcoin, would be much higher than in my place due to the role of energy price in economy activity.  Also, you might find a solar panel is a worthy set up in this scenario thanks to sun shines on you as well.
1
As I mentioned in OP, I definitely once shared your ideological convictions about taxation. As I've gotten older I've come to see that the "taxation is theft" vulgar libertarian sloganeering represents an extremely simplistic (but self-serving, for certain groups of people) understanding of both value and power...In particular, the most compelling flaw for me lies in the relationship to [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource). If your property's value derives from externalizing costs onto other people, that is a form of taking from them to aggrandize your own wealth. In other words, theft...Because no human being created things like land, the breathable atmosphere, oceans full of fish, etc., fully individualized property rights in them do not make sense from a justice perspective. Rather (and this is the basis of [Geolibertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism)), if anyone wants to take from, or otherwise use the capacity of, a commons, they owe everyone else for the right to do so. The prices for the individual use of the common-pool resources need to be sufficient so they are not over-used, degraded, and exhausted in a Tragedy of the Commons scenario...This can be structured in a variety of ways - for instance, setting limits on the amount that can be taken/emitted in a given year, and [allowing participants to freely trade the license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading) to do so is one more market-based alternative to a set [use tax/universal dividend scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend). Either approach, though, is far superior to allowing the unfettered individual taking of common-pool resources, which to my eyes, far more clearly falls under the rubric of "theft" than such taxation.
2
I live in Ukraine and we have modest prices but our energy sources get bombed by terrorist country.

> fully individualized property rights in them do not make sense from a justice perspective..Since we disagree on this, all you build on top of that obviously does not lead us anywhere.
2
>setting limits on the amount that can be taken/emitted in a given year..this is price. The real tragedy of the commons is that the true price of non-nuclear energy is unbearable, so it's been offset into the future.

This scenario is extreme in the context of this comment threads.  In this case even internet and all services based on are not sustainable.  However, the concept that money is an abstraction of energy accounting remains true.  You could still use the battery or peanuts as money to exchange for goods with other people as both are physically energy storage rather than abstractly like bitcoin or gold via the concept of proof-of-energy work sort of mimic float charging.
1
The energy is scarce and I can run an Ether node off of my home reserve power supply coz it is powered by an iPad charger..The energy is scarce and no matter how many bitcoins I have I can’t create energy from the thin air..But I can still run a node cos I have cellular/satellite connection for node..You live in a no problems world, Ether is sustainable in a war situation and is ww3 proof.

If you are complaining you don't have enough energy for mining, you can look at my comment reply to the other reditter in this OP.  Actually bitcoin currently has multiple chains and you can choose one easier chain for mining.  As you can still access reddit and I assume your internet is ok, I guess your situation is far from a terrible war scenario I mentioned above (the peanuts money) and I strongly suggest you get a solar panel because on average it provides 342 watt per square meter and I read news that Russia is targeting your energy infrastructure so your iPad charger will be useless soon. ..Did you understand my mentioned logical proof that the proof-of-energy work is the only way out?  Currently eth is proof-of-stake.  If you like that, I can only say either you want to be the new power-that-be of a repeated ugly money history or you really don't have a clue what money is or you are a bot...Sorry, as bot prevention, tell me what is the last digit of (123)\^456 + (789)\^101112 ? if you want to go on the conversation.
1
You are pretty dumb to assume that bot wouldn’t be able to solve junior school math. But it is consistent with the rest of your argument. ..Regarding your first point: you say I install the solar panels for mining but the next thing you say is that I won’t be able to run my iPad charger?..Our energy infrastructure is under attack for ~800 days and we are defending ok while republicans block the funding for us to protect hospitals and schools...You didn’t address any of my points and just plain stated that your proof is right but I clearly showed to you that:.1) energy is scarce .2) wasting it on mining is dumb

It’s not chaos at all . By letting the market decide what has actually value and what no , you have the best people and services to serve the community with their advancements . By contrasts , relying on a central entity leads to magnify human flaws in terms of what is valuable and what is not . Atm we should start with a limited state which just sets the boundaries , takes care of people in need , and let the free market thrive . In the following decades we could also have a “decentralized network state “ , but it’s a bit too early now

Hans-Hermann Hoppe is libertarian, technically.  But he is on the far right of libertarian thought.  ...Most libertarians are much more accepting of people's difference.  ...One can have libertarians who are not accepting ... in that they are not friendly with those with whom they disagree ... just as you can have liberals who are not accepting of those with whom they disagree.  ...A libertarian, however, unlike a liberal, must be TOLERANT of those of whom the disagree, and failing this, they cease to be libertarian ipso facto.  ...In order to understand the difference, you have to understand the difference between tolerance and acceptance.  ...If I accept you, I think you're just fine, your presence does not annoy you, and I am generally nice to you.  ...If I tolerate you, on the other hand, I may not be as polite, I may let you know that I don't like you ... but yet in order to remain libertarian, I must none the less refrain from violating your rights, or advocating that the government or anyone else violate your rights on my behalf.  ...I, personally, am accepting of nearly all people, to the best of my ability.  If you make a habit of demeaning or insulting me, or if you do things that are just nasty, like using the n-word in anger ( as opposed to the way that rappers might use the soft-r form), or "shaming" people for their sexuality, then that acceptance might devolve into mere tolerance.  I will won't violate your rights, I won't harm you or advocate that others harm you ( in theory, I'm human, I \*COULD\* lose my temper and assault you ... but I'm 55 and I haven't done that since I was a child and did not know better, so you're pretty safe with me ).  ...What I may not tolerate, probably WILL NOT tolerate, unless I am simply out-manned and outgunned and unwilling to die on that hill, is people who fail to tolerate peaceful people.  If you insult people, I won't physically stop you, but I may tell you you are an asshole and I don't approve of your behavior.  If your reasons for doing so are particularly bad ( e.g. racism, homophobia, etc) then I will probably tell you more loudly.   ...If you actually initiate force against people, then I reserve the right to put a stop to it, by any means necessary.   I may not do so .... I don't owe anybody free security services, but I may well.  If I fell that person has brought the situation on themselves, e.g. shouting hard-r's in Harlem, I am much less likely to choose to help you.

You do not have to be a libertarian to like Bitcoin. However, it implies that you lack knowledge on the subject, which is not uncommon, but it is great if you realize it and try to fix it...> Is this the way to go?..yes..>  Is it a good idea to have no state and organize everything by the "market"? ..yes..> Social Darwinism?..that's something else..> Does this kind of thinking really provide more freedom/benefits for the people?..yes..> For me, it sounds like chaos..That is common. Just think about how you perceive a word "anarchy". It is not unlikely that if you come from where masses are, you watch some TV and the word "anarchy" is put as a synonym for chaos and pictures show anarcho-communist (or similar) people destroying property of their capitalist enemies...But anarchy does not mean anarcho-communism. Anarchy means only "no state". Only if you combine that with something like communism, you can get that picture that is presented to you as anarchy. ..But what libertarians envision is anarcho-capitalism, which is nothing like anarcho-communism (or similar) except that they both look for "no state"...>  the informed early adopter will form an Elite..There is such super advantage of early adopters on the free market. On the free market, even if you are first and do good, if you change that and stop providing the best available service to the market, someone else will beat you...> I also realized that libertarian economists like Hans-Hermann Hoppe are connected to far right parties like the German AFD...I don't know about that. May or may not be true, would be surprising to me, but would not matter. Since we are for "no state", there are no political parties to support, except perhaps during transition for parties that would strictly cancel regulations one by one...> As European, a government without social securities (healthcare/education/ unemployment benefit/...) sounds like survival of the fittest...Understandably, as you are fed this idea since you are a baby.

Libertarianism is not the same as anarchism (belief that a stateless society is best). Also, many libertarians hate Hans-Hermann Hoppe. Myself included. ..Libertarianism is simply the idea that freedoms are good and we should maximize them. It takes both the social freedom aspects of leftists and the fiscal freedom aspects of the right. However, most libertarians belive that there is some good amount of government, just that it is less than what we currently have in most countries.

If anything history has taught us anything it is that country’s/civilizations/governments that utilize fiat currency fail.  Over and over , every time they debase the currency to cover over expansion growing beyond their means. ..To understand BTC you must understand money. ..Once you understand money you will  see that more government means more money printing. We are at war with Covid, Carbon, The Russians , terrorism and whatever comes next. ..We will see the expansion of weaponizing USD , increasing deficit spending by the US government regardless who wins the election, this leads many to feel that it is just a matter of time before a crisis forces a reset or a paradigm shift. ..The USD is the reserve currency for the world except for bad countries but continues to debaseUSD,   the effect is spread world wide. Now treasury bonds don’t sell so good and more countries seek gold   ..We are here in this particular time with many emerging technologies neural link,  AI , BTC, automation , any many undisclosed technologies still being developed will form the future just as fire, iron the wheel. ..Government is a necessary evil, hopefully someday we can break the chains  of fiat. ..Imagine a day with no inflation and if you fight a war you have to do it with the funds you have , not debase the value of everything else.

Libertarianism is not "anti-government". You're thinking of anarchism (which could be considered a subset of libertarianism). Libertarians usually hold the view that there are several important things a government should do (usually defense, policing, and dispute resolution are the main ones), and that governments should basically not do more than those things. ..>  it sounds like chaos..It doesn't sound like you know much about libertarian thinking. The founding fathers in the US could have all been considered libertarian. In fact the term "liberals" described people that were basically libertarians until the 1920s when the great depression for some reason shifted people who self-described as "liberals" into meaning something rather more socialist leaning, where government would help struggling people and help fix the economy. This is not what liberalism meant for hundreds of years...In any case, my favorite economist that talks about libertarianism and even anarchism is David Friedman (son of the famous Milton Friedman). He often writes about the more nuanced things in the space and isn't at all dogmatic about libertarianism. Check out some of his writing on libertariansism here: http://daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Libertarian.html..>  libertarian economists like Hans-Hermann Hoppe..Hoppe is far right even in the libertarian sphere. I read one of his book and I thought it was hateful shit...But to answer your main question, you don't have to be libertarian to like bitcoin, but it does tend to go hand in hand. The mainstream modern opinion is that governments should operate currencies. Why they should isn't really made clear. The whole idea of having a non-national currency is somewhat antagonistic to mainstream statists who think the government should do that. So if you're in favor of a bitcoin world where bitcoin *replaces* national currencies, you might have a bit of libertarianism in you after all.

You don't have to be Libertarian to get Bitcoin, in fact, IMO libertarian Bitcoiners lost the plot long ago...You can believe whatever you want, Bitcoin is just Bitcoin, you could as well be a communist and like it...And while it's true that many maxis are larpertarians, that doesn't make everyone (not even all maxis) libertarians.

There's a good reason to believe that bitcoin will eventually eat the majority of a number of classes of assets. Gold + silver + government bonds + corporate bonds +  derivatives + national currencies + credit card credit = $300 trillion to $900 trillion. This doesn't count real estate or stocks or household debt among other things. ..Why would it eat the majority of those asset classes? Because bitcoin has superior qualities to all of them. Its cheaper to store than gold and silver (and most assets that require a custodian). Its far easier to verify and transfer than gold and silver. As an aside, only about 10% of the value of gold and silver is related to its physical uses, and the other 90% is because of their uses as stores of value. It is likely to appreciate faster than bonds and low-value derivatives. It doesn't bleed value like fiat currencies. Its cheaper to spend than credit card credit (by about 6X not including interest payment gotchas). [Read this for more details](https://governology.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/so-you-want-to-understand-bitcoin-part-1/)..So if bitcoin eats 50% of all of those things, that's about $100 trillion of value on the low end. That leads to a future price at that equilibrium of over $7 million per bitcoin. Only 10% of those things? That's still a $1.4 million bitcoin. ..There needs to be no monopoly for bitcoin to succeed in this way. Bitcoin has numerous beneficial qualities that give it a competitive advantage over all those assets for many people in many cases.

Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Therefore 21 million is arbitrary. It takes just as many resources to send 1 bitcoin as it does .00000000000000000001 bitcoin. Physically, it doesnt matter if you own 1 billion or 1 billionth of a bitcoin. They take up the same space. With that said, there is no physical limitation with bitcoin so inflation and deflation has no real effect on its function or capacity. With fiat, you can't get lower than a penny but with digital currency you can get infinitely small. So what does all this mean. It means that a pizza could cost 100 bitcoin or .0000001 bitcoin depending on the arbitrarily assigned value. Either way, it takes the same pizza and same effort on the blockchain no matter what the arbitrary number is valued at. All that to say, hyperinflation has zero effect on the actual function of bitcoin. Only its value. Even then, people will just use .00000001 instead of 1 bitcoin. Makes no difference.

It doesn't really make a difference for censorship resistance. The ETFs are already maximally censored in that sense. anyone who buys them already expects to be maximally censored, so anyone who cares about that, won't touch them and no-one will accept them for payment, because they can't.

I'm leaning toward your viewpoint, the more thought I give it,  what this guy is predicting would probably only come about if the government attempted to commandeer and control Bitcoin, as they did with gold, and that effort would be likely to fail due to Bitcoin's very nature.  At first glance this guy made a convincing case, because what he describes is what ETFs will undoubtedly do.  Thanks for the reply.

It *absolutely* can make a difference in terms of censorship resistance- consider the economic weight of a node when faced with a network soft-forking situation. If a huge number of coins are locked into a regulated custodial account, then that custodian’s node will start to have a larger say in the outcome of such forks. ..You aren’t just giving them your coins to hold, you’re also *giving them the ability to influence the rules that govern your coins*!

I don't think you understand what a soft fork does. Soft fork can't \*change\* the rules. That'd be a hard fork. Soft fork can \*only add \*\*optional\*\* new rules\*. Anyone who doesn't like the effects of those new rules can opt to just not use them and stick to doing transactions according to the old rules instead and be unaffected by the new rules...A soft fork is meaningless unless the rules it adds start getting significant usage.

I understand well what a soft fork can do, and it can indeed effectively ‘change’ the rules. It may help to consider that a soft fork can be described as a restriction of the consensus rules. ..Some of what you wrote isn’t correct in the extreme case. Consider a situation in which regulated custodians have enough economic weight to enforce a new rule that says coins can only be sent to whitelisted addresses. This would be a soft fork by definition, and it would affect all UTXO holders, whether or not they like it. (This assumes a majority of miners enforce the new rule, but that is game-theoretically implied by the term ‘economic majority’ in these discussions). ..Don’t let your guard down just because something is a ‘soft fork’. I can’t seem to find it now, but there is a good article/talk out there somewhere from one of the core maintainers, about how basically *any* change can be pushed as a soft fork if you do it in a clever enough way.

The scenario you're describing is one where miners have done a hard fork, which would materialize the moment a non-compliant miner produces a block that includes any transaction that doesn't follow the changed rule...A soft fork is only a soft fork if it doesn't make any block or transaction invalid, that would be valid with a previous version. It's a hard fork if it changes things like this.
1
Nope it’s more of a grey area than that- the fork I described wouldn’t make anything invalid in the view of any nodes on the network. Transactions paying to non-whitelist addresses would still be valid, they just wouldn’t ever be confirmed in the most-work chain. ..Old nodes would happily follow along with the new-rule blocks, which means it wouldn’t be a hard fork. A hard fork introduces something that old nodes will see as invalid, which the above scenario does not. ..(Semantics of hard/soft fork aside, I hope this helps to highlight the dangers of locking large numbers of coins into regulated accounts).

What you described is a hostile miner led takeover attempt of Bitcoin. Nothing, whatsoever, to do with an ETF. The people who don't like the new rules, will pick the first block that's invalid with respect to the "new" rules and hardcode that to be a required block in the full node software and continue the chain from there. Market will decide how much value each part of the network will end up having...The only effect the ETFs could have on this process is to affect how much value finally ends up on each fork, but even that is a coin toss because both forks would become less valuable, which could well trigger mass exits from the ETFs overall, which would further reduce the overall market value of both forks to total much less than the original chain had...That last part is why I doubt the ETFs would want to start playing dumb games.

Having an ‘economic majority’ of full nodes backing such a thing is exactly what could embolden miners to sign on to participate. Cronyism and politic-ing amongst regulated entities is inevitable. The issue is the centralization of power. ..(Also fwiw, hardcoding a block to ignore the attacking majority is not really a viable solution. If you replace the consensus mechanism with politics, that only means the consensus mechanism itself has failed).

Yes, if the scenario you're talking about were to actually happen, it'd be a failure of the consensus mechanism...This is one of the potential weaknesses of the blockchain model. It can only stay unchanged and keep it's full value if a big enough portion of the market wants it to stay that way...The attack you were talking about with regard to the ETFs is of the bait and switch type. First they offer investment vehicle into Bitcoin, then once they have enough "mass", they'd proceed to convert them into coins in an inferior altcoin while pretending it's still the original Bitcoin. Even going so far as attempting to kill the original Bitcoin in the process...That said, ultimately, the ETFs are just middle men. Whether such an attack succeeds depends on the whole market and the influence of the ETFs can easily end up cut off if enough of the ETF's customers figure out what's going on and decide they don't like it...It's not really a technical issue. It's a social one. One of the cornerstones of Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is the assumption that the market, as a whole, would prefer Bitcoin as an open platform only regulated by it's own consensus rules...The situation you're talking about can only come to pass if a large majority of investment into Bitcoin comes from people and organizations who are oblivious to what made Bitcoin valuable in the first place.

Title: Initial Investigation into Miner Collusion

Dude, if folks want to write whatever they want to write into the blockchain and pay for it, that's precisely what it's there for.  You have no idea behind the motivation, or what makes it worthwhile.  To them.  And you have no right to impose your definition of what is "worthless" on other people...That is, in fact, the whole point of a censorship-free network...Individuals can determine value for themselves, and transact in that value, irrespective of the values held by others.  Yourself included.

Going theaters for some movie, some "smart-that-be" introduced an accounting hack so that the fee by way of entrance1 is artificially lower than the fee by way of entrance2.  Then another "smart-that-be" plan to raise the fee rate by way of entrance1 to counteract the effect.  What a mess.  The average Joe that just likes to arbitrage the fee shall not be blamed and the world would be much simpler without those "smart-that-be".

If you are a small or mid-sized miner who is receiving less revenue from your pool because your pool is spending resources pumping the price of transactions, then it would be worthwhile for you to switch to a pool that does not pump...Not only is this digital drug abuse, this is also mistreating people who use the block chain.  An intervention would be helpful.

Yes that is true I agree, even though i also believe nfts are a sort of spam xD
