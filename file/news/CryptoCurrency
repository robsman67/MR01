It's slowly creeping into traditional financial system and DEFI has so many advantages & higher yield while being transparent; defi just has to solve the hacking problems & needs more insurances.

tldr; Bank of NY Mellon CEO Robin Vince, in an interview on the Opening Bid podcast, expressed confidence that cryptocurrencies will not dethrone the dollar in the foreseeable future. Despite acknowledging the rise of digital assets and their potential, Vince highlighted the limitations of cryptocurrencies and emphasized the enduring importance of the dollar. He also mentioned the bank's interest in evolving with technology, including blockchain, to enhance the efficiency of the dollar in the global financial system...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

This venture, which could launch on Ethereum or Polygon mainnets, plans to sell 30% of its WLFI tokens after reaching a $1.8 billion valuation. Managed by Donald Trump's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, the project aims to challenge traditional financial institutions and empower average Americans. However, it faces scrutiny over regulatory risks and its potential impact on Trump's electoral prospects...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

you have to be really crazy to vote for a fool with no political vision, incapable of making a meaningful speech without reading. but, hey, she has a good laugh.
-4
Ripple works with big banks, who are also in the DNC’s pocket. So it makes sense...Trump is the first anti-establishment candidate we’ve seen in decades, so obviously he doesn’t have the establishment’s support. It also why all the establishment Republicans support Harris. They’re all the same, and want to protect their power structure.
-4
Stay out of politics
-4
They must have dirt on him
1
After seeing the DNCs lawfare to remove a political opponent (who met all the requirements) from the ballot, I see them as being far more dangerous to democracy. They preach one thing, and do the exact opposite. Suing to remove political opponents from ballots is the type of thing that's done by authoritarian regimes. The Trump campaign never prevented this political opponent from accessing ballots, even though he took far more votes from him, than Harris...So as I see it, voting for the Democrats is worse for our democracy than voting for Trump. By voting for Trump, I’m voting for my country...Plus, the Democrats have been on a 4 year campaign to destroy the crypto industry. While Trump’s VP pick owns Bitcoin and his current advisors all hold pro-crypto stances...To me, the choice is clear.
-4
 I get where you're coming from. Ripple's all about navigating the regulatory waters, which doesn’t really align with the crypto spirit of decentralization. It's interesting how they play the game, but endorsing a political figure might just add more confusion in the crypto space. Just feels like a strategic move to shield themselves during their ongoing issues with the SEC.

Can you point me to a meaningful speech the felon has made at any point during the current campaign? Meaningful as in a clear message that isn't ranting and insulting someone at any possible chance? Looking forward to that.

such anti establishment. very drain the swamp. much honest. wow...Is it possible that maybe the "establishment republicans" (which apparently doesn't include the vast majority of congress, state governors, right wing media, or the heads of the republican party) don't like Trump because they're no longer incentivized to put up with his bullshit since they retired already? And in many cases he personally insulted them or their families? And in some cases they genuinely don't feel criminals and insurrectionist wannabe dictators who lie compulsively should be President?..  .If you want to see how an actual anti-establishment republican is treated by his party look at Ron Paul in 08-12

You wont get upvotes in reddit because of all the bots and trolls but i agree, the Democratic party stands for censorship and control. Any criticism towards Kamala is responded with “but Trump..” . ..The truth is these people have severe derangement, and it was proven when they tried to convince themselves that Biden was fit to be president and “sharper than ever”, then the debate happens and they can no longer deny how incompetent he is. ..These people literally watch their own party eliminate their own leader because he couldnt win and then supplant their pick Kamala and everyone just gets in line with the programming.  They will stop at nothing to avoid losing. People like Pelosi, and the Clintons that control this democratic machine are absolutely evil and hate American.
1
Sir this is Reddit, where people don't come to be persuaded but to scream at the other team. Don't bring your to fancy logic here, saying that both teams are just different flavours of the same rotting shit. Their team is more important to them than anything else and nothing you can say can penetrate their bubble, nor do they want it to.

Good to see others on here with common sense

😂😂😂 Trump literally does interviews every other day, in long format, all over the globe. Literally hours at a time with no teleprompter and actual live questions from the people. ..You say this likes its hard to do. Go to YouTube

Felon, huh? Means nothing from a de-rat shit state with a rogue AG on a political vendetta to "get trump". Funniest shit of all is how blue states, who were so pro illegals, up until red states that actually have to deal with the horde invasion daily, started to bus them into the blue states. Then it became REEEEEEEEEEEE!
-8
Lol, you're just projecting. Everything he said was true and you just go to the same old playbook
1
Here is where I become outraged and meme case bOtH sIdEs 😡
1
Not denying that the felon talks... alot... but there hasn't been a single speech of his that I've watched that sticks out with a coherent well thought out message. And often his answers are... well..not really answers. For example someone asked him some specific policy questions recently. One was on abortion and I can't recall the second right now. But his response was something along the lines of "we're gonna have a great policy on this. Not ready to share it yet but we'll have a press conference on it soon" which isn't really answering a question without referring to "notes" because he's incapable of not ranting nonsense. ..Also I don't really get why using a teleprompter is such a taboo thing all of a sudden. Like it's more common to use a teleprompter than to not use one. And it's clear as day when the felon is using a teleprompter and is not. Because he rants and insults when not using one because that's all he knows...The great and holy Ronald Regan used a teleprompter so I guess they were just a big phony after all.
4
When I go to YouTube and watch videos of him talking I see a demented moron trying to string together completely random thoughts.
2
Just curious, do you have any meaningful speeches in mind that the *felon* (convicted by a jury, not the AG) made during this campaign?  Again, ranting and insulting people the entire speech does not qualify as "meaningful"
10
Imagine typing this out and thinking you aren't the one "REEEEEEEEE!"ing lol.

Everything I said is true. Deflect more. Answer the questions I posed.

I'll only accept this if you can include a Trump/Biden/Harris quote out of context that makes them sound bad but that has since been disproven many times but is still somehow used by the opposing team.
1
Yeah you havent tried at all and your probably trolling....Hes stance on abortion has been laid out plenty of times. Hes not against it...If the only thing you can do is watch 30 sec clips and create an entire worldview for yourself then thats on you...He just did a whole thing with lex freidman. Like its painfully obvious. Your lying and coping saying something as silly as all he does is rant an insult. ..Easily verifiable by going to YouTube.
1
The problem isn't when politicians use teleprompters during long speeches, that's quite normal. But when they refuse to hold any live interviews, and ONLY speak with prepared speeches, that's a major red flag...Trump has done countless of long-form conversations/interviews during the election cycle. Including some with audiences who tend to be less supportive of him.
1
Seeing as the Judge was almost as bias as the AG, if not more, how many of those on the jury were fair and unbiased?  Political vendetta as I said before.
-9
Thanks for the suggestion and watching it now! 15 min into it and there hasn't been a single articulate point on policy. "Ukraine war should have never happend and I'll put an end to it" ok but how?.. then goes on and on about blaming Biden. Q: China. Ends up ranting about Biden and crying that Kamala is now the candidate. Talking about Biden in a swim suit? "I have a plan to end the wars but can't tell you". Trust me bro. Q: Losing the 2020 election. "The election was a fraud". And rants about the border and Kamala and "the harm she's done" "it's destroying our country". Again this is about the 2020 election? "They're emptying out their prisons into America". Sounds like an off topic rant to me. Then goes onto Afghanistan (which was trumps deal with the taliban). What does the pull out of Afghanistan have to do with losing the 2020 election and criminally attempting to overturn the results?..Yeahhh that's a lot of ranting without answering the questions asked. If you want You can call me a troll for not viewing it the same way as you. But I've certainly done more than watch 30 second clips over the years.
1
If we're talking interviews, then yeah I can get behind that. In general it would be nice to see more unprepared interviews/questions. I was going with the original comment about speeches.
1
What role did the judge play exactly in a trial? I wasn't aware that the judge gives a guilty verdict. Because I'm pretty sure that's the jury...And given that the felons legal team played a role in selecting the jury, that's the felon and their legal teams job to ensure...The felon himself was involved in the selection of the jury, according to their legal team. So if they were biased, why didn't they do a better job? I'm willing to share sources if interested...Also.....Just curious, do you have any meaningful speeches in mind that the *felon* (convicted by a jury, not the AG) made during this campaign?  Again, ranting and insulting people the entire speech does not qualify as "meaningful"...Just looking for one speech :)

33% fiat is insane if you have more than a few months of savings.

 It's an interesting take, but isn't the concept of UBI meant to be, you know, universal? Everyone shares the same benefits. Making your own income is great, but calling it a "personal UBI" seems a bit off. It's more about social safety nets for everyone, right? Just my two cents.
2
Everybody can be rich but bot everyone...
1
>It doesn't make any sense...Yes it does, but I understand that this UBI seems different than the idea you had of it yourself and thus you argue how this isn't UBI. Updating your idea of an UBI is harder than accepting another theirs. Basic human psychology. So with that having said, indeed, it's not UBI if only one person gets it. Thus, this idea lets everyone have it. But the number won't be fair? I know. It's a tough game. We're all trying to make it more fair, or at least, the majority of us does. In varying ways. Posts like this is part of these attempts.

because those with 1k net worth or less could still save and win lottery earnings of over 10k without losing a penny if they use defi/crypto, thus if anything, it should be 50% fiat, 0% stocks and 50% crypto to honor the present and maximally aim for hoping on a better future than the present

> 33% fiat is insane if you have more than a few months of savings. ..I know. But for many, their numbers look very different. The point is not to argue for 33% specifically but for a general ratio to maintain that acknowledges and incorporates all 3. The numbers will be different for every individual. It shouldn't be 0%. That is perhaps the main point of this post which is kinda preaching to the choir here, thus, different numbers, same point, same direction :)

That's what I'm saying.

Ideally, we have both. But I kinda gave up advocating for UBI, felt way too much resistance everywhere, so I'm changing my strategy. Instead of trying to change the world, offer a new perspective on the current world with the hopes of it being of benefit to everyone.

You still can't make your own Personal Universal basic income. That's just called your own income. Everyone can make their own income but that doesn't make it universal because the universal part means everyone gets the same thing. It doesn't matter what your intention is, the word means what it means and it doesn't mean what you're saying.
2
You’re missing the key point of what makes UBI, UBI. ..Which is it’s universal, meaning everyone gets it...What you’re describing is building personal wealth, which by definition isn’t universal, because it only applies to you, the individual...Not everyone has the financial means to separate their income into an even 33% split. The vast majority of people in the world live paycheck to paycheck. Which means they need 90% or more of their income to be in fiat, because that’s what they need to live. ..The theory behind UBI is that you’re given enough income from society, usually through taxation to have your basic needs met. Which in turn should help you save more of your non-UBI income...It’s not UBI if it’s you saving for yourself only.

So you’re suggesting to win the lottery. ..Right.

I am simply moving on and advocating for a new kind of UBI because regular UBI consistently meets resistance to a point of still not having spread like a meme all around the globe of being a good idea. After so much resistance, it only makes sense to take the feedback and patch the signal, until it finally breaks through into the masses.
1
No I'm saying if you have just a few dollars, you can meaningfully invest that through crypto/defi into a no loss lottery where sure you wont make much of your current holdings, but at least there is a *chance* of winning a big meaningful amount, which is simply *never* going to be the case with stocks (or fiat which is technically also just stocks, but with huge built in issuance, fiat/stocks are financial instruments with different properties)

Again, it’s not UBI if it’s an individual saving for themselves. That’s the exact model we already have which continues to push wealth toward the highest earners...You essentially just described how people save to live off their wealth, which is exactly how something like saving for retirement works...You save money so that you can live off the interest. That is in no way, shape or form, UBI. ..The whole idea of UBI is to even out the wealth distribution of society. ..If you’re not dispersing the wealth among the entire society it’s not any form of UBI.

Alright, the skepticism is healthy, clearly we're dealing with a veteran here. There is indeed a loss, you lose out on the interests gained on your funds that you could have staked or put into a regular bank to gain interest. You'd lose your 5% on your $10. But you'll have a non zero chance of winning $10k+ which your $10 would have taken 100+ *years* to get to $10k (though if you're 5% gain isn't higher than the inflation of the USD then you'd never even get there)

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that the whale bought 862 BTC at an average price of $56,933 over three days. This purchase occurred amidst a broader trend of whales and sharks accumulating Bitcoin during price dips, indicating a strong belief in its long-term value despite current volatility. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin's price was at $56,038.29, still struggling to reach its all-time high of $73,737 from March 14...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

 It's true that there's a lot of noise around whales buying up BTC when the price dips, but the overall market feel can be pretty contradictory. It's like one moment it's all bullish vibes, and the next, prices are still heading down. Can't help but wonder if they're buying to cover up their own sell-offs or if they really believe in a long-term comeback. Just part of the crypto rollercoaster, I guess.

Title: Ethervista ‘unconsciously hacked’ hundreds of times by bot
0
tldr; Ethervista, an Ethereum-based platform, was 'unconsciously hacked' hundreds of times by a bot following another attacker's instructions. The bot, created by PhD student Chaofan Shou, exploited an integer overflow in Ethervista's router contract, unknowingly repeating a malicious transaction. The initial attacker made 10 ETH, while Shou's bot and others collectively made around 28 ETH. Shou emphasized that Ethervista's liquidity pools were not at risk, as the vulnerability only allowed for the sweeping of fees. Ethervista faces other issues, including a bug affecting fee distribution among liquidity providers...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Imagine if the bot was actually conscious 😵‍💫
1
 that's a wild situation. It's kinda unsettling how easily a bot can exploit these vulnerabilities without anyone really being aware of it. Guess it shows how important it is for developers to keep an eye out for bugs. Glad to hear the liquidity pools are safe, but it seems Ethervista's got a bit of cleanup ahead of them. Certainly a learning moment for everyone in the space.

Title: Russia mined nearly 54,000 Bitcoin in 2023, says industry expert
15
tldr; In 2023, Russia mined approximately 54,000 Bitcoins, valued around $3 billion, according to Sergey Bezdelov, Director of the Industrial Mining Association. This activity could generate about 50 billion rubles in taxes for the government. The recent legalization of crypto mining by President Putin is expected to attract more investors and increase tax revenue, contributing to economic growth. This move is part of a broader strategy to circumvent economic sanctions and includes plans to establish crypto exchanges in Moscow and St. Petersburg...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

 That's a pretty bold move by Russia to ramp up Bitcoin mining like that. With the whole sanction situation, it makes sense for them to look for alternative revenue streams. I wonder how this newfound wealth will play out in terms of their economy and the global crypto market. Feels like the game's changing again.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs hit 7-day losing streak, outflows surpass $1 billion

tldr; US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows for seven consecutive trading days, totaling over $1 billion from August 27 to September 5. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the outflows, with $374 million leaving, followed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF with $227 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust also saw its second-ever outflow since its January launch. This period of outflows coincides with a decline in Bitcoin's price and increased market uncertainty, with Bitcoin trading around $56,500...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

 Seems like the market's in a bit of a rough spot right now. With those outflows and Bitcoin's price fluctuating, it makes you wonder what the next move for investors will be. Are they just repositioning or is there a bigger trend at play? Always interesting to see how sentiment can shift so quickly in crypto.

The scam is that he won't be able to withdraw his money. Tell him to try to withdraw his 20x gains and see what happens. Remind him that a confirmation withdrawal is standard procedure for vetting any financial service.

>this is a daily occurrence  .  .How does it usually play out?

 Yeah, I’d definitely check out r/scams. It's always a good idea to get more info from people who have dealt with this kind of situation before. Plus, seeing patterns in how these scams operate can sometimes really hit home for someone who’s skeptical about their own experience. Just approach it with facts, and hopefully, they’ll start to see the red flags for themselves.

 Yeah, Monero definitely has its niche with privacy and all, which sets it apart from a lot of other cryptos.

Title: Another Country is Thinking of Adding Bitcoin as a Reserve
0
How does an opposition figure represents a country?
9
tldr; María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition figure, proposed adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve asset to address Venezuela's economic crisis. She criticized the financial policies of past and current Venezuelan presidents, which led to hyperinflation and a significant devaluation of the Bolívar. Machado believes Bitcoin can help rebuild Venezuela's economy, protect assets from hyperinflation, and ensure donations are safe from government seizure. Her plan is motivated by Venezuela's unique economic challenges, distinct from similar suggestions in the US...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

🥱😴
1
Yep....plus, has any countries out there actually adopt it as a reserve (officially)?     They're all just 'thinking about it?'   Zzzzzzzzzzz........
3
 It's a fair point. Opposition figures often don't have the same official stance as current government leaders, but they can still advocate for big changes. It's interesting to see how this kind of stance can push the conversation around crypto, even if it's more of a symbolic gesture at the moment. It just shows how desperate the situation is and how traditional measures aren't cutting it anymore.
2
We like misrepresentation in titles and text that fuel our hope in BTC.
1
She represents the country more than the current government. The official results of the last election were fake and her party won by a huge margin.
1
Maria Corina seems like a nice name, but Venezuela has a lot more to fix before betting on Bitcoin to solve economical issues and huge corruption level.
1
El Salvador has under Nayib Bukele introduced BTC as strategic national reserve & as legal tender...In terms of the reserve, they are in profit. As far as the adoption as legal tender goes, it is hardly used.

On a certain level, this is not dissimilar to what Bukele walked into...  .Gradually, then suddenly.

why hasn't the french president been put in prison yet?  oh yea he's a typical lefty tyrant.

It’s already not available in the US. ..Telegram wallet says restricted country in their in app wallet. ..Even a vpn still doesn’t get past some of it.
1
Oh mon dieu!..That is exactly what Macron wants.
0
 Yeah, it seems like the market is shifting pretty rapidly, and Pavel's stance probably just reflects how many companies are trying to protect their interests. Alternatives are popping up everywhere, but it does make you wonder about the long-term effects on innovation and user choice when platforms just bail on certain regions.
2
It takes away power from those governments. People will just go around it with VPNs and etc. it's the same reason they allow BTC to even exist. If they push too hard they lose the ability to tax it and at the same time risk creating a fractured financial economy, half of which they have no control over.
2
Indeed. It harms no one, it benefits the users. Good policy. Thank him for following it when necessary.
1
They just go after all of them. Throw people in jail just to make an exemple.
1
Take caution. Telegram currencies must very riscky right now.
2
... Leave markets... they should have not entered those in the first place. Doesn't he follow CZ and Binance.US case...
3
I don't think it is possible for some scenarios. For example, Signal is open source and in their github repo under Legal things they wrote: "This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted. See [http://www.wassenaar.org/](http://www.wassenaar.org/) for more information."..Therefore using a Signal app is basically put in hands of each user and he has to obey the law to comply with the law. The software is there and if your country does not allow it by law, then the user should not use it. Therefore, it is in the users hands whether to obey the law or not. Meaning, Telegram is closed-source and if they go from certain market, then in a sense they will just disable the distribution of certain app over the marketplace and users won't be able to use it anymore. But here is the catch, since Signal is open source project, they can't ask them to stop developing application. It is just that the user should not download it if it is not permitted by law and puts a decision of whether to obey a law or not in users hands...Yes, someone could make a pull request for some "backdoor" code to be merged into signal. But people will be able to see it and if someone gets paid to merge into the signal, people will notice it, create a fork before the merging of the backdoor code (new repository of code before backdoor happened) and inform everyone that Signal is not safe to use anymore and people can start using Signal2 app. ..At least that is how I see it, but I could be wrong. But in a sense, Telegram can now leave ios and android market and people will still be able to use it because someone can upload .apk file (android) on the web for others to install it on their phone. Meaning, the user is now using Telegram app without consenting with local laws.
3
Signal has a central server. If they successfully block access to that, Signal stops working...Removing it from the iOS and Android stores would effectively kill it for the average user too.
2
But they also introduced a TLS proxy that can bypass these blocks which would in fact make it hard to block this central server...I do agree with removing it from stores would cause an issues for average users that do not intend to do anything suspicious, but would rather stay away from companies analyzing their data and do not trust them. ..But in this sense, who is France "fighting against" or better say would like a backdoor built in to spy on certain groups of people or to later obtain information what they've been talking about? It's not about average Joe who is talking with a friend about the movie they've seen or what he ordered from a restaurant. But for those who do plan to do harmful things either to society or some government official (or some shady stuff like selling drugs). And those people will always find a way to safely communicate if there is a way. So it won't affect them because those are no regular users, but the ones that really do everything to not be tracked down. But ultimately once you built a backdoor in the app, you can't count on safe and secure messaging anymore...It's complicated topic and I do not know what is right. I do understand that this safe communication does in fact have some negative consequences on society as for example it enables a safe channel for people to do shady stuff (child porn etc.). But if there is a backdoor, then ultimately it enables people with more power to have control over you and you effectively live in a society of control/surveillance. But there is only one way or another and I do not know which one is the right one. Is it ok to enable someone to be able to share child porn? I don't think so. But is it right for someone to be able to spy on you? No. ..Governments want to control and have a power over people. And for sure such applications as Telegram and Signal bother them, because they are not able to control people. But I do not know what is right. Either there is a free speech or there is not. There is no way in between.

They also control 100% of all crypto because they can shut down the exchanges whenecwr they want...Disnt binance already freeze accounts because israel told them..?

Used to be the going rate for a quick BJ. Nothing much has changed except the rate.

Do people not understand how MEV bots work. Thats not unlucky, its what its supposed to do.  It would still do the trade if it needed to take $120m loan, as long as it was profitable by 1 cent. its 0 risk trades, so the loan amount is irrelevant.

I have a bot on binance. It makes 0.2$ per trade...Not much, but it adds up, since it does it many times per day.
1
Article doesn't say if it was a flash loan, but if it all executed in a single block then it was probably a flash loan...You can flash loan $12million.
10
Well, you're not a bot and don't have the means to guarantee your profit :)..This trade would not have been made if it could have turned into a loss. If you are 100% guaranteed a profit, no matter your investment, and no matter the profit, the smart thing is to take it.
4
It's a flash loan, the tx only gets executed if it can be paid back in the same tx...There is no way to take the loan and lose it/owe money, the tx just wouldn't have succeeded...It's a bit of a glorified article that misses technical aspects.
2
Those $20 are from when I sold low after buying high.

Bot is never one of us losers :/

well technically no but a very small return for the size investment it made.

In my country just one, sadly

I have 0 doubts it would be the best way to go!

The Arkham report actually does call it a flashloan, but I haven't looked at the tx details myself.

It's gonna be a flashloan, so no investment was made.

 Yeah, I see your point. Telegram is definitely a big player in this space, pretty much like the WhatsApp scenario you mentioned. It's interesting to think about how mainstream apps getting into crypto could change the way people perceive and use digital assets.

if she wins she's going to take all your cryptos anyway, why even bother giving it to her?

But what if "people are really talking about it, good beautiful people with big strong hands"

The only way it made sense to me if they had said Crypto polls...But I'm pretty sure there are no Crypto polls being conducted.

 Yeah, it’s kind of wild how some politicians play the crypto game without really being in the know. I mean, it's like trying to ride the hype train without even knowing the stops. Unrealized gains taxes are definitely a tricky topic, and it feels like some candidates are just jumping on the bandwagon to look good.

Well then I would be obliged to believe, specially if people are coming up to you with tears in their eyes.

I don't support any taxes. Especially unrealized gains taxes

yeah fuck schools and firefighters and roads, all that shit is for losers. I want the wealthy to be able to horde all the wealth and be able to sign up to be their indentured servant

Title: Staking POL after the upgrade
2
so does matic suck now? should i trade it for shib?..fuck me, i wanted to be depressed before beddybye so i looked up my 2021 bittrex order history..paid $2..fuck me.
4
So those who are/were staking their MATIC through the native way on ETH network don't have to do anything to migrate to POL right? I mean, at the moment they click on "unstake" they will get POL right?..Thanks for this post, even thought I am quite sure about my questions answers I still have that little doubt in my back.
2
I love how they sneakily changed the max supply from 10 billion to infinite and all people notice is the name change. Their plan is working.
1
Any fair fee way to send POL to Ethereum?
1
Polygon changing the name of its token is a meme at this point, even though this change actually made the most sense out of all of them.
1
Yes, when you unstake, you’ll end up with POL
2
This sub has been shitting on that in every matic thread
2
geez that's f'ed up ...anything devs said about that ?
2
 Yeah, right? It's like, first they switch to MATIC, now POL. But honestly, if it makes the whole system work better, I’m not mad. Just feels like they’re trying to keep us on our toes or something.

Title: 70% of World Liberty Financial’s Tokens Are Reserved for Insiders: Report
3
Well, that that's no surprise. Trying to Milk those Crypto bros, Don, ain't ya?
7
tldr; A draft white paper obtained by CoinDesk reveals that 70% of World Liberty Financial's governance token, WLFI, is reserved for insiders, including founders, team members, and service providers. This allocation has raised concerns within the crypto community, as it heavily favors insiders over the public, with only 30% allocated for public sale. The white paper also indicates WLFI tokens will be non-transferable until there's regulatory clarity, and funds from the public sale will partly go to insiders and partly to a treasury for operations. This model contrasts with other major blockchain projects like Ethereum and Cardano, which reserved a smaller percentage for early contributors. The project, promoted by Donald Trump and his sons as a tool to empower everyday people and counter a 'rigid' finance system, is still adjusting its tokenomics...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

Well, screw them then

With Trump NFTs that he launched the rug was even more effective since 100% of the mint fees went to the team/insiders

 For real, it feels like they just wanna line their own pockets while the rest of us get left in the dust. Seems like classic crypto play, nothing new under the sun.
1
The tokens are non-transferable. Meaning you cannot buy or sell them
0
You predict a rug pull on a token that cannot be bought or sold because it is non-transferable? ..This sub is full of geniuses I tell you. Nobody reads the article or summary and say the same impossible thing.

I will hold until the end of 2025 and see - if crypto is dead when at least we tried... But remember normally it takes 6-12 months after halving for price to kick in. Of course it can be wrong this time but selling on September which is the worst month historically is questionable decision
7
BTC is almost touching the ma50 on the weekly, might even happen today, thats bullish af iykyk

This whole thing has me more bullish than in a while. Which might sound weird. Maybe it's a kink by this stage.

Wallets cold and still,  .charts whisper of dreams deferred—  .hope waits in the void.

Look, the data today comes out bad, we will first probably dump, then go up because the rate cut of 50 points is then secured, like it happened during the week already when the jolts numbers came out...Recession this and that. It depends on how bad a recession is. Only because the GDP is two quarters -0.1% and job numbers fall by 2% and the unemployment is 4.3 instead of 4.2, nobody is going to sell off big amounts...People are also talking about rate cuts being most of the time negative, yeah, because they come during a recession. We are not in one yet and the job numbers and no economic data will change that in the next 10 days dramatically (maybe I am wrong here)...But I am also uncertain if rate cuts will be a selloff event or not...My feeling is that the 25 point cut would be better because it's planned/expected. Worse numbers now would mean 50 points cut, but that could be interpreted as a panic reaction and the market will also react to that...Why would a rate cut be a sell the news event otherwise if there is no more serious recession on the table right now? Rate cuts mean cheaper money, it's generally good?..On the other side I think the next 10 days will be really choppy. But we won't go down another 20-30% .. a bad September is btw on average -5% or something. BTC is already down around 8%. Just saying.

Looks like a pretty good time to be buying purely based on the fact that people in here are capitulating and doomposting

The market is no longer bearish after the statement of FED cut rates . That statement is true ✅..September is the least volatile month for Bitcoin with only 20% volatility in the last 6 years .That statement is true ✅ ..Bitcoin is down -6.19% for the month of September . Corresponding 9 of the last 12 years since 2013. That statement is true ✅...The Bitcoin chart starting from 1 st of July to 6 th of Sept indicate -  an inverse head and shoulders pattern . Where the first shoulder dated 5th July 2024 is $53,485 and the head at $49,000 , we can certainly say that the second shoulder will be around $53,485 . That statement is true ✅...An inverse head and shoulders predicts a reversal in a downtrend and signals the start of a bull market . That statement is true ✅...Bitcoin is currently trading for $55,890 . A 4.3% higher than the predicted shoulder point . ..We expect with certainty Bitcoin should not fall lower than our expected second shoulder at ^$53,485 <..Let's look forward to the US job data which comes with high volatility . High unemployment, higher rate cuts .

Do you guys realise that Total crypto market cap in march have reached almost same level like top in 2021 that’s 3T dollars Your ADA VET Eth didn’t reach all time highs because there significantly more crypto projects and money got spread across the board hopefully there will be 2 run up like in 2021 but it would be wise of you to put 50% of the table when market cap reach 3T$ again

Imagine the world without crypto, without an escape valve… look at how rigged the system is. All of a sudden everyone is placing maximum importance on jobs numbers, even though everyone who has been working has been running up credit card debt because they’ve gotten fucked by inflation for the last 3 years with no matching pay raises. Recession has been going on for workers. It’s a stupid simple concept. But I guess now the wealthy are ready to make it official.

Bunch of squishy paperhands around these parts...

Relax Cryptonians...this is the calm before the storm. DCA if you can or just keep HODLing. With The Fed lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply,  we'll be back to new all time highs before we know it!

We had so much good news...All kind of laws in x,y,z countries improved. X,y,z countries to buy BTC. ETFs, presidents and governments that are talking. Some billionaires talking about buying and btcs potential..Rate cuts incoming, stable coin cap rising and rising..We had halving, so prices must go up soon, etc etc .....So what holds crypto back? The sentiment that September is a bad month?

People still fear mongering with Tether? Jeez.

I think a positive is that everything is dumping. Even the stock market. ..If it was just BTC then that would be more worrying.

Jobs report day is finally here. Jobs openings have been lower, ADP was a huge jobs miss, layoffs reportedly soared in August. Highest layoffs since 2009. Jobs claims are flat but flat since forever. Hasn’t moved an inch in months. ..Anyway, bitcoin is either going to 100k or going to 23k as the bears say. Hopefully we get some good news.

Who is ready for a bloodbath today? BTC hasn't performed based on fundamentals for months now. Stocks up is BTC down stocks down is BTC down. Not to mention the economic data. Each event is just a "sell the news" event, no matter good or bad news. So no matter what, King boomercoin will crap the bed today. Hope I am wrong. But I can see sub 50k today. ..And for the inevitable "I hope so!" and "then I will buy more" comments. Why? BTC has had 2 cycles in economic boom time with free money flowing. Not so much now. Where is this money coming from which will propel BTC to 100k? Retail which can't even afford groceries and rent? Remember, it wasn't institutions who caused the bullmarkets. It was retail throwing spare money into everything.

Right now it's at $2000 and still dropping. TRUST Wallet shows it at 19 cents and DEX shows it as .005 cents. I don't really give a shit as it was a $25 dollar purchase 2 years ago but Google won't give me any help. I'm assuming it has something to do with jup.io shutting down?

To be honest guys, at this point I still can't figure out why at least half of the countries on earth haven't adopted bitcoin before other countries do. It just shows that our politicians aren't smart and when BTC goes to a million, they will start fomoing like the dumbasses that they are.

>The jobs report has landed, and shows hiring was weaker than expected in August...>The U.S. added 142,000 jobs for the month. That was less than the 161,000 economists expected, but a pickup from July. The unemployment rate was 4.2%, down from 4.3% the previous month...US FULL-TIME JOBS DECLINED BY A MASSIVE 1 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN AUGUST🚨..The number of full-time jobs fell from 134M in August 2023 to 133M in August 2024...At the same time, part-time jobs increased by 1 million...This is not a strong labor market in the long run but seems acceptable and plausible in the short term ...You can't compare August to July which both are worse to the worst .

Nothing is promised. We've had Septembers in the past that were -20-30%. And with the amount of negative sentiment now I wouldn't discount it. We've been selling on positive news, what happens when we actually get some really bad news. Long term I do believe there is upside, but its good to be ready.

Imagine there was promo last month targeted on MILLIONAIRES....If you locked MILLION in CRO, you would get 'amazing VIP benefits'. That million is now 750k in 1 month. So I am not sjre, if those VIP benefits are worth 250k lol, but gg millionaires....And there were many of them who fell foe that scam. Cronos went from 0.092 to 0.105 briefly when they announced this scammy promotion. Sell of started the very next day, so there was no opportunity to take money back with slight loss. 10% from million was gone immediatelly.

Too high unemployment and too high rate cuts could also spook the market instead of driving it up .. 😐

Until very recently crypto dumped with stocks making ATHs

Nothing positive about that. Because if its the opposite and the stock market is up, bitcoin still goes down. It just confirms what kind of shit Bitcoin is.

I'm actually tired of my job and i've been rejecting extra work from them. Ironically even though I should have been fired long ago for my work ethic, I still have my job. I think jobs that are short staffed are way harder to get fired from..Also I wonder if the bad jobs report heralds a recession coming

Its going up down or sideways

Oh that’s for sure. Sweep them both up!..Sweep the leg!!

>This bear market..Have you been through an actual bear market?

is he still dubiously speculating?
4
Used to watch some of his videos in 2021, my conclusion was that he does not offer any kind of predictive insight - the same for all crypto YouTubers
2
Like his analysis. He called out a lot of things right so far. His last case for soft landing is about 42k for BTC. For hard landing about $23k. As of yesterday. And thats coming from him.
-4
That would be a ridiculous dump if it did happen. I don't think 48k seems even close to realistic for this weekend.
1
"Massive", aka less than a percentage point drop, big whoop...Market is fine, unemployment is at 4.2%, it's 6.6% up here and our economy is fine too.
2
Am I reading the same one as you? All reporting says unemployment rate has lowered meaning stronger employment and labour market..Is this report good or bad for crypto prices?
1
So it's under expectations, better than last month. So kind of flat/negativ...So no signs of crazy recession, but 50 points are locked. Maybe a good setup 😅😁........
1
Stay strong chief, imx i believe imx will be big this cycle
1
Well I sold a fraction of everything to buy back a little more soon, isn't that the move ? Being over-exposed and constantly bleeding is a bit distracting to say the least 
1
Yes, you could technically sell off here and buy back just before/just after the rate cut decision (if it pumps up then) and catch the uptrend and probably still make a profit as I see it dropping further right now until the 18th.
5
We are technically at the 20% of september. Its been dissapointment like previous 5 months so far.
1
I am getting out in spring 2025 if prices spikes up. Or taking some money out, shorting with rest of it. If I dont see bullmarket I am getting out as well, no future of crypto at that point.
0
Shall be interesting.
3
Yes but it was only 1 time. Usually it's around -8% to -3% average...What could really bad news be? Unemployment rate of 6% instead of 4%. How likely is that? War fud? We had all that already. Recession fears are playing out already...Ofc there can always be bad news, but what's the likelihood now.
1
I was but then I was naughty and added a little more in the last few weeks. Now looking forward to the violent sentiment shift before eoy
3
It only became doom & gloom when the worst part was already over
4
To be fair it's the people over allocated in alts with most of the fear and it's alts I'm buying now. I'm not calling a bottom but I like these levels on some coins.  I bought heavily from 15k-25k when there were calls for 10k, again that felt like a good time
4
They in fact entirely did, mood was ten times more bullish than compared to now lol
5
42.
-1
Picture the 40s
-2
This. Most coins are most likely just dead, too many bagholders. Ada/Algo/Atom/Lrc and list goes on. Only decent alts surviving are BNB and SOL basically lmao ...If you have zero of that then maybe there can be some good gains but any purchases made in the previous years will most likely never turn green
1
Thanks for the chuckle :)
1
Briefly in 2001 on doge.  However Elon on Saturday Night Live pretty much ended that.  Still have a little doge that I bought then at 60 cents .. I know I'll be dead before I break even on it .. keeping as a souvenir. Same with Maga Trump and Kamala coin.  Most of my money is in SOL and it does ok.  The reason I'm 30% behind is because I used to believe in ADA.  Have a very big bag of it and feel certain that the coin will never be worth a shit and I will never get that money back.

Sir, you are in the wrong sub.
1
>A25 basis point rate cut could initiate a gradual uptrend for Bitcoin after an initial sell-the-news event. This scenario signals the Fed’s confidence in economic resilience and could lead to long-term price appreciation as recession fears ease...>On the other hand, a more aggressive 50 basis point cut might trigger an immediate spike of up to 8% in Bitcoin’s price due to heightened liquidity expectations...>However, this surge could be short-lived, potentially followed by a correction mirroring past instances where aggressive rate cuts initially boosted asset prices before economic uncertainties tempered gains.
3
Still 50% down...
4
Yep, that's been my strategy .. for three years now.  There is a distinct possibility that I will die of old age before I can break even.  I'm a gonna have a bot keep buying the dip for me though .. never know ... might get resurrected.

For a short while, but by mid October heading into November, we're gonna pump hard!

So buy after it pumps again?

You know what the price is going to be in the near future? Trust me bro

1
Because BTC has been acting like a tard to any form of news. Doesn't matter if it's good or bad it dumps, less so on good news, but still a dump. There is a high chance the job numbers today will be bad, and if so, it will shit the bed massively. A combination of the usual "sell the news" dumpers, stocks falling, panic sellers, and overleveraged gamblers.

Well my trader was on a different site for a few months. He said he was changing sites to copycryptotrader. I asked if there was a fee or not for transferring/opening the acct on the site. He said nope. Now the site wants 1k$ to activate the account.. so he lied. Im thinking about going somewhere else.

Historical trends matter more than anything else… we started dumping a few days ago because it’s September

Or people like you need to experience some pain before you start thinking rationally and stop with the hopium that can get people wrecked.

Give me a good reason that with all this negative sentiment and fear in the markets, we will magically just turn around on a dime and everyone starts pilling in cash in the most risky asset right on a possible verge of a recession?
3
Remind me! 2 days
1
Fear
2
I feel the short term prospect is just really not there. ..There is a high chance the unemployment comes out bad today, and even a slightest uptick will just cause a crash with already such a negative sentiment. ..Rate cuts are bullish medium to long term, short term we will definitely see a sell of, as it has always been historically. ..We are still in a downtrend, both in macro and micro. Below all the moving averages. Weekly RSI just crossed down its support level stemming from the last 4 years. Every time it crossed down btc retraced 20-30%...Alts still need to be flushed more it seems until total capitulation. All the charts and btc dominance show it...On top all that we are in the worst month historically for crypto...No upside anytime soon. So frankly f this. I'm out. At least for the near future.
2
What makes you think it can't go any lower?

Remind me! 10 days

i mean, the opposite is also true.  doesn't take much other than a tweet from dfv or cohen or his muskiness to send the market shooting straight up.  speculative markets are always volatile.

yeah and held position. ..yet after all that fallout we have continued to bleed out.

also most of that was overblown nonsense.  the yen thing was probably the biggest issue bc of carry trade.

It's not as old as some alts so fewer bagholders? 😅

Probably is a good move but after holding and not selling anything for over 2 years I have the feeling as soon as I will sell a little we go flying lol
1
Thats the plan. I see at least 15-30% drop from now until the end of the month at least. So I feel it just makes sense.
2
And the same will apply later, people will start to get excited after we've topped out xD

Gotta start somewhere...You'll be able to sell some alts for profit while others are still holding their old bags at a loss xD

They seem to matter when things go down…  sell in May for example ...But also Santa rallies are a thing too!

I have heavily DCA'd in the bear market and have seen thousands of euros vanish in a single day (FTX dump, LUNA dump, ALTS securities dump, YEN carryover dump etc.....) Movements like this don't bother me TBH because when I look at my holdings over time I see beautiful gains with more to come in the future.
6
I could tell you that we are still range bound, that we could even wick down to around 51k like we did early August and still be ok, but I'm tired of repeating the same thing so you do what you think is best and good luck.
1
What will that prove? 😅 You sold for couple of days?..Look, the data today comes out bad, we will first probably dump, then go up because the rate cut of 50 points is then secured, like it happened during the week already when the jolts numbers came out...Look, recession this and that. It depends on how bad a recession is. Only because the GDP is two quarters -0.1% and job numbers fall by 2% and the unemployment is 4.3 instead of 4.2, nobody is going to sell off anything. ..You are also talking about rate cuts being most of the time negative, yeah, because they come during a recession. We are not in one yet and the job numbers and no economic data will change that in the next 10 days dramatically...But I am also uncertain if rate cuts will be a selloff event or not...My feeling is that the 25 point cut would be better because it's planned/expected. Worse numbers now would mean 50 points cut, but that could be interpreted as a panic reaction and the market will also react to that...But look, why would a rate cut be a sell the news event otherwise if there is no more serious recession on the table right now? Rate cuts mean cheaper money, it's generally good...On the other side: the next 10 days will be really choppy. But we won't go down 20-30% if you are expecting that.. a bad September is btw in average -5% or something. BTC is already down around 8%. Just saying

Or just a calculated and rational decision, thats based on facts that r right in front of you.

i feel the same too but i'm down so much, i'm numb. yeah i know the price can go down 99% more.
1
And how about cycles?..It takes 6 to 12 months after halving for supply shock to kick in. We are only 4 months in. Bullrun should happen not sooner than 2025, nobody said bullrun will be in 2024, it was just etf hype. Also historically September is the worst month

I rest my case.

You could as well keep flipping coins in every corner of your house and notice inside the pantry you had 9 tails out of 11, doesn't mean a thing...edit: here you go, ran a [random green/red generator](https://i.imgur.com/vbTGrNF.png) covering 11 years, seems like February is gonna be your "9 green out of 11" years month.
-2
The Luna / 3AC / FTX (etc) drops in the last one were quite exciting on the day. Like being on one of those amusement park rides that drops you fast from a great height... 😅
2
Well if March indeed was the peak, we are already 6 months past that, in bear market BTC would already be 50% or more down during that time frame, which it's nowhere near that.
1
Which is so good. I think the recession fears were the reason that was tanking the market...If the recession fears would disappear, the unemployment/jobs data still being meh, it's a good setup for a good 50 points cut with no recession fears? Good?!

They won't start getting excited after we've topped out but they'll surely remain excited. But yeah it's just the other side of the same trade

Oh thank goodness. I was losing hope.

dude got a crystal ball but still no billionaire how does that add up
3
It's people who were too scared to buy during bear that are the loudest doomsayers now. I've been buying as much as I could through all those events that you listed like yourself, so short term movement doesn't interest me. We could go down to 30k and I would still be in profit. They are just looking for validation for their bad decisions.
7
Remind me! 2 days
1
Its a downward range with lower lows. If we are still within the range we will have to put a lower low than 51k. If we indeed put in a higher low thats a different story. But as of now, I just dont see it.
1
See you at 40k.
1
you made a decision, all the best!
3
It has been the wildest rollercoaster. But at some point it pays to be realistic I feel.
1
We are 6 months in now. And I think there is more to the "cycles" than just an arbitrary time window. BTC is tied to macro economy, more than ever now ,especially with ETFs, so I feel its only reasonable to pay attention to the broader markets.
3
I meant ~55k is not a dip that would make me go and fire an impulse purchase. I did that a lot below 25k during the FTX debacle. If we get 30k tomorrow, then yes I can consider buying more, but the current numbers are not "buy the dip" worthy.
1
Yeah cuz he’s a bitch
-4
Stop with your trolling, you’re not even funny...There’s a seasonal aspect to money inflows

we survived. oh yeah fuck alex machinsky!

What makes you think we can't go down 20% more from here?

Trust the asset that has underperformed for months now and dumps on any news good or bad? Ok bro.
0
yea this..my portfolio is still in the positive and i hold zero btc..looking back i should have definetly dumped on the people crying now who bought in march so that i could buy back from them now for a fraction but it is what it is
3
2 days is a really short time horizon bro. Still, I hope you can buy back lower and scoop up more than you had before, it would be an amazing call.
3
did you buy in march? ouch
1
Ah, I should have used a non-seasonal random number generator then...
-2
We can. But 6 months into bear market we would have been a lot lower than now. This is nothing like ‘22
1
True indeed. I was actually about to sell at 60 few days ago, but just thought I'd see how the job numbers come in first. I feel we ll prly go lower short term. Dont get me wrong, still bullish long term, just for now I cant see the upside atm.
3
K
2
This makes sense. If you can buy back for cheaper then why not?  Swing trading this right now on a downtrend seems like the right move. ..One day it’ll go up. Maybe even today, but if you have been selling recently, especially at 9:30am ET and buying back a few hours later you most likely have been making some profit or increasing your stack.

Title: When Tether flips Ethereum by m/cap will that be the point the majority of the crypto community finally calls it out? 
0
Tether is the 18th biggest buyer of US treasuries at auction. They get leeway ..The Fed is never audited either ...
24
Lose Tether, lose all good pricing... half these kids couldn't trade on a ETH/BTC pair if they wanted to, volume tanks, prices tank, use case tanks....
8
"The Crypto Community" has a vested interest in never calling Tether out, even if they got caught under-reporting reserves (again) or committing outright fraud...Tether is one of the few USD on or off ramps for Crypto, it's one of the principle methods rich Chinese citizens are using for evading currency controls, and it underpins a huge amount of the buying and selling of tokens through both exchanges and DEFI like Uniswap...Basically if Tether goes under it takes the price of every Crypto token with it, so regardless of how shady they act or what they do, the entire market has a vested interest in not calling them out or even really talking about it. You can see this in the lack of discussion around everything you're mentioning here, as well as every report of them freezing tokens or working with the government, which between the two should have the vast majority of the Crypto community calling for their blood... and yet, crickets...
10
People don't care.  They say it's good for the market.  But if Tether isn't legit, *eventually* it will come crashing down.  I'd prefer it crash the market now for a brief time rather than in 5-10 years.  Things will just be worse the longer it waits.
6
Because absolutely nobody except for the Feds and this sub cares. There have been multiple multi billion dollar bank runs on tether and it has redeemed 1:1 every time.
4
This pile of trash has been running for a decade. They'll just keep printing and fucking us holders...
2
Hey man, tether saving all our lives. Lets look the other way
2
I have zero interest in Tether, but I'm not the target audience. The fact is, it's changing lives and enabling people to transact safely in places where US banks can't or won't go, and IMO that's fucking awesome. I've never used Tron, and actually wouldn't even know where to start, but USDT on Tron is killing it, and making the world a safer, more free place to live. More power to them both.
2
The reason to disown it is because they publish quarterly attestations?...USDC doesn't have a full audit either.
3
So many bad takes in a single post...First of all, what does ETH's market cap have to do with the timing of when the "crypto community" (whoever that may be, it's not like we are one unified entity) calls out Tether? These two have nothing to do with each other...And calling it out what for? Is there any new evidence that they are fraudulent? I don't think so. If anything, they appear more legit now than ever. The reason that their market cap is growing is because more and more people trust and decide to use Tether. That's a good sign. Also, there have been so many spectacular busts such as FTX, BlockFi etc. and endless fraud being exposed over the past years, but Tether is still standing and stronger than ever. People predicted its downfall since 2017 and they are still here. They are also one of the most profitable crypto companies and even if they might have not been fully backed in the early years (which is speculation), they certainly are now. Getting a full audit isn't as easy of straightforward as it may sound (see here: [https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/tether-ceo-just-told-us-why-the-big-4-wont-audit-its-books](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/tether-ceo-just-told-us-why-the-big-4-wont-audit-its-books) )
2
Is it possible for the network to remain secure (as a PoS) if there is a token on there network with a higher value?
1
Tether doesn’t *need* to do anything. They are one of the most profitable companies on earth that just continues to explode in growth quarter after quarter. ..There is a specific reason why they WON’T do a full audit and my guess is that it would expose many skeletons in their closet from years past that are big and bad enough to be devastating for the company...The fact of the matter is they very clearly do not have to do shit about a full audit and will just continue chasing that #1 spot as the largest US Treasuries holder for purposes of leverage, all while simultaneously bursting at the seams from rapid growth. ..I feel like I have a better chance of seeing God than seeing Tether commit to a full audit.
1
I genuinely am of the belief that stablecoins is a HUGE innovation in the game. (Not particularly pointing which one) but it flipping ETH? Not sure if that is something I'd want.
1
TLDR : nope
1
Nobody calls it out because things are bad as they are right now!
1
It’s an open secret. They have a deadman switch that’ll detonate all of crypto so there’s lots of money outside of tether that’s very invested in keeping them afloat
0
Lol the entire community of crypto bros can call it out but it won't stop Tether..The only thing that can 'stop' Tether is if their offices get raided and the FBI arrests every single one of the 12 employees and put them in jail
0
Then why hasn’t the price of usdt go up?
-1
Fed recognises Tether, Tether recognises Fed..They are all assisting each other with fake money printing and laundeirng
9
>The Fed is never audited either .....A good point 😂 Not sure many trust the Fed either
1
Some Bitcoin maxis legitimately think that Tether printing is somehow 'suppressing' the Bitcoin price which is hilarious
1
People call out Tether all the time. Even Vitalik has warned about Tether.

 Honestly, people are way too invested in Tether to just call it out and risk everything. It's like the crypto community collectively looks the other way. They know if Tether goes down, it’s gonna be chaos for all of crypto. It’s a risky game, and nobody wants to rock the boat when they’re riding that wave, even if they have doubts. Just part of the hype and grind.
4
Appreciate that's often the perception from those that are anti-crypto however there's many people that are pro-crypto that are also tether cynics. Lots of [posts regularly on here over the years](https://www.google.com/search?q=tether+site:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)
1
There used to be a lot more Tether FUD (even whole video documentaries on how it sprang from the ruins of bitfinex) but everyone is just bored of it at this point. People have been waiting for it to implode for years...Maybe it will, maybe it won't, but I can't see an imminent mechanism for bringing it down...It's already survived multiple ~80% drops in crypto market cap. Maybe the people running it are just really good at managing the fraudulent aspects of it?
1
The FTX dip of BTC to 16k would look like a dip for ants if Tether actually does go down

This. Bubble gets bigger, the crowd cheers louder. Than, poof is and it's gone. This time won't be any different.

USDC's m/cap has only increased $30 billion over the same timeframe, is three and half times smaller by market cap yet oddly surpasses USDT for transactions...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/circle-s-usdc-takes-lead-in-stablecoin-transactions-visa-says....but yip you're right isn't audited either and dispite looking more realistic than tether not sure I'd be placing much trust in it either.
8
I'm not sure it's a bad take, rather a differing opinion...I think most in crypto can appreciate why ETH has the second highest market cap more than they would appreciate why Tether would. Particularly when you compare the two technologies and tokenomics. Could be wrong though. ..Not so much evidence it's fraudulent rather than a lack of a full audit it's legit. ..Maybe it's just me but I've been around in crypto a while and have haven't come across many tether-maxi's...I think getting a full audit that's really the only thing backing a $120 billion stablecoim is the least that should be asked of Tether? No?
5
>Getting a full audit isn't as easy of straightforward as it may sound see here: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/tether-ceo-just-told-us-why-the-big-4-wont-audit-its-books )..Some of my post is based around what I've read in the article. One of the standout points is that even Ardoino concedes getting an audit with one of the big four should be a priority. ..>*In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG — are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. “None of the Big Four companies will audit us,” Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether’s auditor is a “top priority.”*..Without it's almost impossible to determine Tether. Isn't a ticking time bomb and the wider crypto community should maybe consider limiting exposure to tether until it can?
1
This is simply deflection from the fact that it is literally still inflating the price of Bitcoin today, even if its impact is now marginal compared to years in the past...Even though it’s not done specifically to manipulate the market, every time Tether does its ‘this is an authorized but not issued transaction’ song and dance and mints 1,000,000,000 USDT, the price of Bitcoin pumps shortly after, almost as if it was on command. There are trading bots with parameters built in to take advantage of this every time Tether mints USDT...There’s also the “speculation” about whether Tether intentionally manipulated the Bitcoin market, artificially fueling the 2017 bull run. Which was later dismissed in court due to technicalities and regulatory uncertainties...Then there was that one time when Bitfinex lost access to $850 million held by Crypto Capital, and covered up the losses by borrowing from Tether‘s reserves. ..As well as the laundry list of other shady shit they have done in the past, like underreporting reserves or the countless wash trading allegations or the fact that Tether would use secured loans (loans to who is never specified of course) to count as a part of its reserves, or Tether providing FTX with whatever amount of capital necessary to keep the ponzi afloat in exchange for FTX using USDT exclusively. Shit I could write a god damn novel here, but I think the point has been made. ..A very honorable, integrity driven company that Tether is. No doubt about it.
2
in a way it is, but probably not how they think, and they wouldn't benefit from btcusdt not being "suppressed"..if tether was decided as defunct, people would spend their usdt, so the usdt pairs would rip. just like asset prices, this does not represent a value appreciation, it represents a depreciation of the instrument the asset is priced in.
1
And it gets no traction every time. Vitalik has made a few statements amounting to "eh, they're kinda sus" but he's not pushing it, just like everyone else, because he wants his bag.

The vast majority of people calling out tether are not crypto people.
0
It's a small minority, especially in the past couple of years. Search the past year of posts and sort by 'Top' and you'll see what I mean. Barely any criticism, lots of talk of how valuable they are, how much money they're making, etc. There's *some* criticism mixed in, liie assuming there's probably *something* shady going on there, but you see that regarding basically every Crypto project at this point. The default mood is basically 'grift until proven otherwise'.
1
Agreed there used to be more, but Tether also used to be a lot less central to the whole Crypto-~~gambling~~ investing edifice...At this point I think Tether dies either when there's another crash and someone calls in their loans, or the feds bust them for some slate of crimes from among the fraud/money laundering/funding crime varieties. If neither of those happen then my bet would be CBDC's become a thing and basically kill their entire use case...If they somehow manage to dodge all that then either thet've actually gone legit or they deserve to survive at that point. Personally though I don't see it long term. Too much shady shit, too many ongoing lies, and too many potential points of failure...And as for why they've survived, I think it's a combination of not getting into too much that's outright criminal, an underfunded SEC and justice department, and the specifics of their size and what was going on around them during those crashes...At this point the biggest way for them to go bust would be for a massive contraction in Crypto corresponding with just the wrong rate movement for their bond portfolio, resulting in major withdrawls from Tether. They then have to liquidate huge amounts of their bonds, at a discount, and Crypto to cover the costs and can't quite make it.
1
Yup, which is why no one wants to poke at them and see if their castle is made of bricks or sand.

Looking forward to your next post about disowning USDC.
1
Because the big 4 have never been found to be fraudulent in an audit.....You do know it used to be called the big 5 right?
1
usdt pumping bitcoin price would depend on broad market consensus that 1 usdt is basically equivalent to 1 usd. since there usd pairs are now plentiful, only a break of consensus would result in a decoupling of the usdusdt pair
1
It gets so much traction that posts like these are made on a regular basis. Coffeezilla posts videos on Tether. There are so many Tether Truthers out there and the only contribution they have to crypto is to post about how Tether is a fraud.
3
As has been said in this thread, the majority of tether exists for rich Chinese nationals to hide their assets from the CCP. I don't think that usecase is going away and China doesn't seem bothered to properly crack down on it...I think you're looking at this as an informed layperson and trying to draw inferences based on too little data...Why do you care if they collapse or not btw?

Feel free to dig in to my post history long-term crypto fan, long-term stablecoim cynic in general. Think I say shit stablecoins pegged to fiat shitcoins a fair bit..
1
Pretty sure if people within the space actually cared this post wouldn't have *two* net upvoted right now...The closest I could find to this or similar criticism among the Top posts mentioning Tether in the past year was one with about 200 net upvotes asking if they were like the government 'printing money out of thin air' and everything else above it was talking about their profit, their importance to the Crypto ecosystem, or their record amounts invested.
2
Guess what OP is saying a post like this should get 500 comments since its such a big thing instead of just 40 comments by now
1
It has two upvotes because Tether Truther posts are tiring. 90% of Tether posts and comments are "how does this fraud exist" and "money printer go brr". Can't read this same stuff for 7 years and care a whole lot...Look back further in time..."I'm not buying until the Tether collapse" 3k upvotes.

How wrong do ~~you~~ Tether Truthers have to be and for how long before people stop listening?
1
Further back in time Tether wasn't nearly as central to the Crypto economy, anf far enough back FTX hadn't happened yet...Remember that Tether has grown *massively* in holdings value in just the past year.
1
Tether moved from $10B to $83B from 2020 to 2022. A 730% increase. ...Tether moved from $83B to $118B from 2023 to 2024. A 42% increase. ...Tether has had actual massive growths in the past before this recent move.

Title: Why does crypto.com show one price as the “live price” but when I try to buy the price is dramatically different?

The real question is why the heck are you buying this token

This is called spread, something of which CDC has the absolute worst of, out of all the large CEXs.

On another note please don't buy that

Worth the spread for sure, that currency might be the future of finance! ..^/s

You're buying some mega random shit coin and calling 10% splipage dramatically different? In what world does your trading work out for you brother???? jesus christ.
38
Because you are a market mover. You even thinking of buying changes the price
16
Because they are about to fuck you on their ludicrous spread
29
Spread them cheeks

This guy is buying a coin called book of meme and concerned about his entrance cost basis. All the money is already gone.
15
You just learned about the spread. The live price u see is just in between (an average of) the bid and the ask...If you want to guarantee price when you buy or sell u use a limit order (now your order isn’t guaranteed to execute if price doesn’t move in your favor)...If you want to guarantee order execution but don’t care about small price fluctuations, then you use a market order - like your picture
6
Take a look at the bid and sell, it's not about the price, that's just the last buy/sell price.
4
Why are you trying to buy the shittest shitcoin I’ve ever seen?
12
Because fuck you, that’s why...The only way to solve this is leverage x10 and put all your money in. Then they collect your whole acc when it dips 1%. Gg no re

The price which you see is tick price and is the price of the last transaction. You need to check bid or sell prices.

It's a sign from God telling you not to flush your money on a stupid pump n dump shit coin.

Order book depth
1
In an order book market system, which is how every exchange works, there are three prices:..* **last** price - the price of the most recent trade.* **bid** price - the highest price any buyer will pay.* **ask** price - the lowest price any seller will take..The last price is what is reported as the "current" price, but the bid and ask prices are the real "current" price...The bid price is almost always lower than the ask price because whenever the bid price is the same or greater, then a trade will occur. A market buy order pays the current ask price until the order is filled. A market sell order gets the current bid price until the order is filled. If the asset has low trading volume, then there is typically a big difference between the bid and ask prices...So, as you can see, there are a few reasons why the price you paid might be different from the "current" price.
1
I hope your shorting this?.Have you seen the day, week, month year graph.
1
1. Because of the amount that you're buying, they don't have much liquidity..2. The spread so they can make money..3. Do limit buys to get the best pricing
1
Exchanges are the #1 rip off and also collude with each other to control prices - which explains why prices follow exactly from one exchange to another
1
Crypto.com is straight-up hype with no substance. They didn’t even build their own exchange from the start, just bought a fancy domain and ran with it. Their infrastructure was rented through a SaaS model until they could finally take it over, so yeah, they didn’t even own their own code...And don’t get me started on their crypto card. You have to stake a bunch of CRO just to get a mediocre card with crappy rewards. It’s a gimmick to lock people into their ecosystem, while offering next to nothing of real value in return. You’re basically paying upfront for a product that’s not worth it...They’re all about the brand and marketing, not actually delivering anything innovative. It’s just another company looking to cash in while offering a subpar product.
1
Basically the price shown is the price it which it was last sold. If you do a market order you are taking the best price a seller will give you right now. Since this is a meme coin the “spread is larger”. Basically there’s a gap between the best buying price and best selling price being offered. I’d you want it at the price shown you need to do a “limit order” where you state the price you want to sell it at. Then you must wait for a buyer to agree to that price. Sometimes that happens quickly, sometimes it doesn’t happen at all.

 for real, that spread is wild. if you’re stuck using CDC, just be ready to get hit with those fees. it’s a rough game out here for the traders trying to make moves on that platform. just keep your eyes peeled and don’t get caught slipping.
2
CDC has actually great features, but you do NOT use it for trading. Unfortunately best trading is probably Coinbase right now, but I never EVER keep money on Coinbase. They have the worst security and support. CDC I use if I have to hold any amount for any period of time not in self custody, and if I want to do things with it like off ramp or spend on the card. Which by the way… is the BEST way to off ramp crypto is to DEX into Tether or USDC and then send to CDC and trade to cash and top up the debit card, then you just spend it like cash everywhere...I have also literally in a line swapped ETH for USD, topped up and spent it by the time I got to the front of the line.

Taxing loans that use unrealized gains as collateral would be far more effective. ..Banks would be required to increase the loan amount by the tax and file it on any loans greater than X million amount...Banks would earn additional interest holding the extra loan amount and if you make the rate 10% or something below income rates, wealthy people would still do it...Then use that income to give middle class additional tax breaks on owning property, lower student loan rates and expanded child tax credit.

712
You need to have at least $100 million...And it's only taxed on the dollars you make over $100 million. So your first $100 Million is not taxed by this...The goal is an aggressive approach at closing loopholes billionaires use to not pay taxes...It's likely never gonna pass, and is more of a bargaining chip to help pass a subsequent less aggressive policy to target those loopholes.

Unrealized capital gains taxes are a levy on hypothetical wealth increases rather than actual income...To enforce such a tax, the government would need unprecedented access to and oversight of personal finances. This level of scrutiny would likely extend deep into every aspect of your financial life, raising serious concerns about privacy and freedom. Do we really want the government monitoring every fluctuation in our investments?..Historically, tax policies introduced with the promise of targeting the wealthy often end up burdening the middle class. .Consider this: if the problem is *truly* about taxing the wealthy, why not close existing loopholes that allow them to avoid taxes? ..Instead, the push for a new tax system suggests a broader, more intrusive reach—one that could ultimately affect everyone, not just the wealthy.

I don’t know about that, but I’m all for being able to deduct my unrealized Algo losses.

Fun fact. The entire US government up until right before world war 1 was mostly funded by Tariffs. We could eliminate income taxes today and the government would be fine with tariffs...We went from colonies waging war with an empire over tea taxes and now we openly let the government tax us to oblivion because they don’t know how to be fiscally responsible and none of them are held accountable for spending our money. That goes for both Democrats and Republicans

It's well beyond past time for the rich to pay their fair share. Why do I pay a higher percentage of my total income to taxes when I'm existing in lower middle class than a multi (b)millionaire who owns half of the town?..Trump has never had to face the dilemma of paying his mortgage or paying his groceries and I know many of you have. It's time to get rid of money in politics and get these corporate skags out of Washington.

So obnoxiously annoying.  We don't have a tax revenue problem, we have a spending problem.  No matter how much the federal governmnet collects in taxes it spends more than it collects in revenue.  Frankly if you look at federal expenditures in relation to GDP it's pretty clear that the federal government expenditures are reliably a percentage of GDP.  I want the federal government to stop deficit spending, maybe even work on realizing a surplus to pay down existing debt after which I'm then happy to entertain tax policy to increase revenue, until then though they are just going to piss away any revenue increases and drive the nation further into the hole and despite what the MMT crowd thinks, eventually we (the citizenry or our progidny) will deal with the consequence of profligate spending...I am however happy that Harris is finally publicly elucidating her bat shit policies instead of remaining a blank template for individual policy projection.  At least if she's elected her supporters won't be able to claim surprised at the shit show, meh that's to much to hope for, most think she's the greatest thing since sliced bread despite her participation in the gas lighting about Biden's mental state and the undemocratic palace coup that has elevated her to the party nominee.
13
It always starts off with only taxing the rich friends
9
It’s a stupid idea that will be nearly impossible to correctly enforce. I’m sure Harris loves saying trash like this because she a) likely has no understanding of tax law or unrealized gains, and b) garners support from similarly ignorant individuals.
17
This does not apply to the people on this sub.  We all buy high and sell low.

It starts at 100m before you know it’s 100k.  Learn the history of taxes. It eventually gets down to the working class.
24
Such a stupid idea. You cannot tax something that isnt realized yet. How do you pay for something that is still in the market? What if you pay your taxes on the gains , and then the market dumps...Income tax was for the wealthy as well, and now everyone gets to pay it. Whos to say this wouldnt be next? ..I'm still voting for anyone but Trump, but this is dumb as hell.
20
Screw this cunt. This is how the income tax started. If they get a foot in the door on this shit we'll all be paying it in no time...When income tax started in 1913 it was 1% for the top 1%. Now we're all paying like 25% or more of our hard earned pay to these idiots who spend recklessly.
19
Can we write off unrealized losses?

She's a freaking crackpot if I ever saw one

Give the government an inch, and they will take a mile. Every single time. I remember when the ethos of crypto was against government control and was for personal freedom and liberation. ..The fact so many of you are making excuses for what is clearly a horrible precedent tells me the morals and the ideals you have are nothing more than that of a socialist or a communist. “Take from the rich to give to the poor” “it should apply to thee but not to me” ..I thought we were better than this.

just a thought but isn't the rise in home equity considered an unrealized capital gain?
2
People with $97 in their account worrying about being taxed on gains they’re $100m short on being eligible for.
2
whats considered high net worth here? oh 100 million, that seems fine.
2
Tax credit for unrealized losses?
2
Nancy will never allow it
2
They want you to sell
2
Should tax everyone because by world standard 99% american are already "the rich".
2
Wouldn't it make sense to just tax any stocks given as compensation as income? Have some vehicle for selling enough to cover the tax at the moment of payout, then dont tax unrealized gains after this...Treat stocks given the same as cash given.
2
It starts at high net worth. Eventually the rest of us will pay it too. Income taxes started at 3% and only for people making over $800 (at the time) and were supposed to be temporary.
2
High net worth individuals my ass. It’ll affect everyone who suddenly comes into a little windfall (home price goes up, stock goes up) and once it affects the democrats personally that are supporting her they’ll be pissed. Just wait and see..
2
I’m more upset about the interest in increasing taxes for 400K families.  I’m a high earner but have a medical degree with lots of years and money invested and little to no retirement and lots of student loans.  It’s fucked up.
2
All of this is absurd and tyrannical. And yet it could be solved so, so easily, by switching from income tax to consumption tax. So easy. But they'll never do it, because sales tax is too transparent for their liking. Too easy for us plebs to understand the crazy amount of money it takes to fund this cancerous growth we call the federal govt.
2
If anyone shit talks this idea just tell them they pay unrealized gains on property taxes. If we have to do it they do too.
2
The income tax only applied to the top 3% of earners when it was first introduced as well…..Now everyone pays the income tax. This is a bad policy any way you slice it.
2
im all for taxing the rich but taxing unrealized gains is crazy.. it's taxing money you haven't made
2
This makes no sense.
9
No wonder Elon doesn't like her lol.
2
Then I want a refund on unrealized losses
4
Dems want to talk about how to raise more money but conveniently disregard how they’re already wasting the money they’re bringing in. Maybe we should focus on being better stewards of the money we already have.
3
All this panic is over Harris’s default and tacit approval of Biden’s budget - a budget that is entirely symbolic because (guess what) the Pres doesn’t have the power to set a budget. And the unrealized gain portion is footnote of a suggestion. Harris has never come out and supported this specific proposal. If anyone has a quote of her actually saying she agrees with this, let me know. I’ve googled repeatedly, and there’s nothing.
3
Unrealized anything should never be taxed, period.
3
Make it 50%.
3
A bunch of Trump voters who don't know what capital gains are, don't have any, and never will, just got really pissed off on Twitter and at their workplace
4
Key context: high net worth individuals. The top .001%. If you make less than $100 million in a year SPECIFICALLY on unrealized gains in the stock market, it won’t affect you. This will only affect like the top ten richest people in the country, and specifically the money that those people have been sitting on and hoarding without moving it anywhere, which means it’s currently doing nothing to stimulate the economy.
13
That is so dumb
5
What else did you expect? She's a communist.
6
[effacé]
4
Its not about high net worth or not. The logic is flawed. ..Asset prices fluctuate, and whats an unrealized gain one year might turn into a loss the next. Taxing gains that are not locked in penalize investors for market volatility...I could see why harris is very unpopular among democrats as she is not a smart individual.
5
It’s crazy how much this is being spun. The author, and those fearmongering about this, are either playing a game of telephone or intentionally being dishonest. ..1. All she’s said, and what started this, was that she supports Biden’s budget proposal..2. In the budget proposal, it calls for a minimum tax of 25% for anybody with more than $100 million since many of these people are being taxed at a rate lower than most of us. The proposal never even says unrealized gains..They have taken that and spun it as “Kamala is going to tax unrealized gains” in an attempt to scare you into thinking she’s coming for your $2000 crypto portfolio. ..It’s not a bill. There are no details fleshed out. They never mentioned unrealized gains. It’s a proposal to have a minimum tax rate for billionaires that often have a 0 to 15% rate. The title of this article “Kamala proposes tax on unrealized gains” is so dishonest
9
Who will think of the high networth individuals!?!
2
Hell yeah.
5
Disastrous for venture capital and the startup ecosystem
3
Harris will make the American dream a reality for so many new immigrants with the money of psycho Billionaires who come from slave owning ancestry and to top it off she’s crypto friendly. Trump is a lying racist rapist dictator wannabe who will force Christian religion on our kids and begin a genocide on the LGBT community. The choice is easy.
3
Have they considered shrinking the government, paying the debts they (we) already owe, and reducing taxes?
4
So taxing real life money on imaginary money.
2
Only to hand our tax dollars over to the freeloading illegal border jumpers. Anybody else sick of this shit? Been to NYC lately?
2
How is that even Constitutional? They needed an amendment for an Income Tax.  Sitting on a pile of illiquid assets isn't an income.
2
Gz to trump on the election
3
This is just them testing the waters and then it’ll be the average joe paying taxes on unrealized gains
2
When the income tax was implemented, it was 2% and applied only to people making over 140k in today's dollars. When the 10k transfer limit was introduced with the bank secrecy act of 1970, the purchasing power of $10,000 was $81,000 according to official sources, and in real life a bit higher, I'd put it at closer to 120k...*All of these rules start out applying only to rich people.* Do you really think that they're only trying to go after their donors? You can't grow revenue without taxing the better off working class. These rules are coming for you and they're selling you a fucking story. Wait until youre paying federal taxes on your home equity and then you'll still find bullshit excuses when we say "I told you so", but you won't care because youre boot cucks with dick envy deep inside your soul.
3
wouldn’t that instantly bankrupt every successful business? lol thats a wild policy but i mean… she is technically a democrat so… its expected
4
I honestly don't think it's appropriate. I think that the gains need to be realize and circumvented will the losses for the net year as is. I'm sorry, but It's literally fake numbers until they are realized.
2
This will never pass and it's a horrible idea. How would it even work or be calculated? The amount of unrealized gains changes every day (if not more frequently).  Do these people need to get an appraiser for their homes, cars, art, wine, etc. every tax season?
1
Which will magically be modified to tax everyone.
2
So, if I bought a home for $200k, and now it’s appraised for $400k…
2
And just like that she lost.
3
Gonna need another Boston tea party if she gets in. All I hear is taxes taxes taxes
2
This would affect anyone wh also invests in stocks. When super rich are forced to start liquidating their stock portfolios at a 2-2.5% rate every year it will put a considerable sell pressure on the stock markets and significantly slow down returns on stock ownership
3
So, it's designed to never pass and to be an empty campaign proposition... Right in line with how Biden admin does things.
2
This seems... not very well thought out
0
This is bad for everyone except the ultra wealthy. They will just dump their shares or send it to tax havens or just make it so they invest just enough to make the cutoff and send off the rest in other investments through shell companies. The only people it will impact is retirement accounts and retail. Retirements accounts cannot pull out their money without tax penalties like the ultra wealthy can.
2
…then for incomes > 500k. ..…then for incomes > 200k. ..…then for YOU. ..This is how government works. Give them an inch and they take a kilometer.
1
Can I get a tax refund on my unrealized losses?..*I'm gonna be rich!*
1
Let's be real, even if it's for people with a net worth of over $100 million, it's all just talk for votes. The people it would affect are the people who give her money so she can keep their tax break, keep taxes low and give them special favors. As low as politicians are in the pockets of the ultra rich, these kinds of policies are just BS to get votes. Her donors would never let her actually do it anyways. Not to mention she only even has the nomination because the rich donors in the Democratic Party and party leaders chose her. They would NEVER choose someone they thought would hurt them financially.
1
Americans over here whining about 45% tax and taxes on multimillionaires. Canada over here like. Hold my beer.
1
How can you tax unrealized gains when the stocks can go negative and turn profit into loss in a day lol
1
This is the worst policy proposal I've ever heard from a major US politician. I have no doubt it would eventually end up applying to people worth 10 million, 5 million, 1 million......You could owe 5/6 figures in additional taxes because your house went up in value. Where are you going to get the money to pay for that, sell the house and live in your car? Nope, your car went up in value too so you can't afford to keep it. ..Even just for 100m and up, it'll result in constant sell pressure in the market that will be felt by everyone.
1
...coming soon to low income earners.
1
I'm really convinced Dems are missing the point on purpose. Unrealized gains are not the issue. Taking out loans against those "unrealized gains" is the easiest fucking loophole to close in the world though...Force people like Jeff Bezos to choose between paying  themselves a taxable salary for their lifestyle, or taxing the loans they take out to fund their lifestyle...Even let Bezos choose. End result is an end to someone living a billionaire lifestyle without paying taxes.
1
Sounds good!
1
Braindead
1
I doubt this goes forward; she would piss off some very important donors...How are Pensions going to work?
1
How about 100% tax on estates over a billion?
1
Threshold should be lesser than 100 million. They are probably keeping themselves out.
1
What about unrealized loss?
1
What about tax benefits and government subsidies for unrealized losses? Asking for a friend...
1
Next they tax unrealized income tax!😂😂
1
Imagine all the tech CEOs dumping billions of their stock to pay their unrealized gains lol. RIP 401Ks
1
If Elon Musk can use his stock as collateral, essentially, using it to buy something else... Then it can and SHOULD be taxed.
1
Let's see Bob from Idaho, making 7.25 an hour at Walmart, defend the billionaires, because he might be one one day (he won't be one)
1
I just feel like this will somehow trickle down to the middle class and doom us all. I would like it to work as intended but the billionaires own everything.
1
This administration is the poster child for a flat tax.  They can’t be trusted with anything…
1
Dumb - forcing investors to liquidate will tank asset prices
1
I plan on becoming millionaire with AMC & GME so that’s a no for me why u wanna stop someone poor form becoming a millionaire

Basically the end of America if this happens
1
Basically the end of America if this happens.

Does it matter what they say. Theyre just trying to buy votes. We all know once in office theyll do what favors the corporations who funded their campaign. Idk why people still believe in this dog and pony show.
1
Welcome to Kamunism
1
This isn’t new. Biden proposed this in 2022. ..https://taxfoundation.org/blog/biden-billionaire-tax-unrealized-capital-gains/..It reads a lot like the conservative view of staking rewards to me. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1
Never gonna happen
1
The idea makes no sense. If their stocks go up and down 10 times 30% over 6 months they’d be taxed more money than they have
1
1. The people funding her campaign will never let this happen. 2. It would be a disaster if it did. 3. If the government did end up getting all these extra tax dollars from rich people they would just blow it on something that doesn’t help anyone.

# What Is Unrealized Capital Gain? Definition: Unrealized capital gain refers to the increase in value of an investment or an asset that an investor holds but has not yet sold. These gains are "unrealized" because they exist only on paper; they only  become "realized" once the asset is sold. The amount of unrealized gain is the difference between the  initial purchase price and the current market price, assuming the latter is higher.   Source: [www.financestrategists.com](http://www.financestrategists.com)..So if I understand this the government can tax somebody for an investment that is still growing. If they don't have the cash to pay it then they would have to sell some of the stocks to pay taxes on money that they have not received yet. That investment could then go down in value the next day in the market due to a sell off to pay taxes. If the average return on a portfolio is 9-10% and they tax it at 25% eventually the government will get all the money and the investor will never have had the gain in their hands ever. How is this fair?..My next question is what will the government do when they figure out that these high net worth individuals don't have enough net worth to support their reckless spending, will they lower the threshold to grab more individual wealth? When they get the threshold down to a million, who will be affected then?
1
And they’ll never miss it, but no one wants to lose more money…. But they are still only paying net 12% in taxes anyway.
1
CAN I GET TAX BREAK FROM MY UNREALIZE LOSS AS WELL??
1
Approximately 10,000 centimillionaires in the US.
1
Don’t be surprised when a socialist proposes more socialism.
1
False, for everyone, not JUST high earners…wake tf up! Your home increases in value your paying increased taxes on it regardless of if you sell it or not….fact check me.
1
i heard nancy pelosi was worth $100 million, does she wanna weigh in on this?
1
Dump Drumpf
1
why not just have a net worth tax. tax people say an extra 2% a year if their assets are above $100 million. that way the uber rich still get their paper gains but have to pay the dividends back.
1
She can go suck a dick. Probably the only thing she is good at.
1
Not just individuals. Organizations, entities, anything with a hand in the market. You gotta shrink those loopholes.
1
Individuals with extreme wealth often contribute disproportionately little to society compared to their means. Yes it’s a good thing to use our finite economic resources in a way to produce more economic resources. Instead of squandering and wasting them. Don’t know if I necessarily agree with the tax through. There may be better/ more efficient ways at raising more revenue from the 0.01 percent...By the way a tax on people with over $100 million in assets would only affect 9,630 people. source
1
If she win prepare to pump hard af bitcoin. Rich people gonna move their assets to bitcoin
1
Gonna be hard to implement. They should jsut get rid of charitable deductions after a certain threshold
1
Thank god
1
But what about when I become rich?!?
1
Only on Reddit is there so many people rooting for new taxes. Really, a special breed who believes in the goodness of governments all across the globe. This being a CryptoCurrency sub just makes it even more ironic
1
This isn't going to work. ..To pay that tax theyll have to take out loans on their assets, creating infinite demand for security loans. ..With banks having a 0% reserve requirement they can just keep issuing these massive billion dollar security loans.   Then that 25% tax is paid out of that cash. ..Money will be loaned that doesnt exist to pay high billion dollar taxes, injecting money that doesnt exist into the economy. ..Inflation will sky rocket. ..This already happens now, but it will happen way faster if they need to pay that 25% tax.
1
I always find it strange that the majority of poorer people who jump to reject these sort of proposals tend to do so because they genuinely think that they will soon be rich. As though generational wealth is just around the corner...You see it a lot in American culture. The American dream is a real dilusion.
1
And just like that lose an election lol (I'm not American, but wow what a way to alienate a while section of your potential voting pool)..And yes I realise it's only for people with 100 million but it's a detail buried by the headlines in the media, and that initial reaction is what people remember
1
Dirty Commie. They also said the Income Tax would only be for HNWP as well at first.
1
Dems favorite playbook. Creating a policy that is illegal to solve a problem and then throw their hands up in the air when that policy gets shot down for being illegal. Instead, they can reinstate  regulations that used to exist that solved this problem that the rich got rid of...You have to ban corporate buy backs of stocks and make it so dividends are the only way to return cash to the investor. Dividends are a taxable event. Corporate buy backs of stocks aren't. Problem solved.
1
I am a touch shy of the 100 million I'd need to qualify.
1
O no! Ultra wealthy people will have to pay taxes, I think I might faint… I am 100% for taxing wealthy people make them pay like they did in 70-100 years ago!
1
People making minimum wage: >:(
1
Normally i’d disagree, but all the fraudulent shit that the rich did with the PPP loans while everyone else got $1,200 really pissed me off...Tax the FUCK out these leeches. If u have 100 mill you won’t miss 25%. Raise long term capital gains tax rates too - a school teacher shouldn’t pay less tax than someone who lives off of investment income...Before everyone comes for me- you won’t be affected ur too poor.
1
And tax deductions on unrealized losses ... ?..(I'm somewhat skeptical of anything these days)
1
Not sure if she has the Tax law figured out. But would you allow you to write off some of your realized gains once you sold the stock for the value you paid in unrealized gains? 
1
Maybe the politicians could start off by trimming the fat and waste in the federal government . .  Let’s start by managing the money we pay in taxes better first, ..[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/heres-how-the-federal-government-wastes-tax-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/heres-how-the-federal-government-wastes-tax-money.html)
1
Do it now then.
1
good, but what makes an individual "a high net worth individual" owning $100b, $10b, $1b, $100m, $10m, $1m ? as can be seen from the numbers "a high net worth individual" is not a one thing, so better to have different tax levels depending on how much "high net worth" you are, maybe something like starting from 5% up to 45% or so
1
What a great way to attract the crypto community
1
It won't remain for "high net worth individuals." ..Don't buy it.
1
Nice I hope it goes through
1
She's so smart lol.
1
I don’t hate the idea. It’s not like these people are even going to sell this stock anyways. They are going to sit on it for the rest of their lives and use it as collateral for loans but it can’t be taxed? I’m no economist but it’s better than more tax cuts for the rich while they make the middle class pay for it
1
They fucked Bernie over because he would have called out this shit
1
Unreliable source 🤣🤣🤣
1
Slippery slope ... This is a sign that the economy is circling the drain when you have to propose something like this ...
1
Communism baby!
1
I found out about this because I have some Facebook friends who are Trumpers. They were sharing this post that was claiming this will impact all home owners if their home values increase. I commented on one and said "Yah Ill worry about this when I have $100,000,000" They must have actually looked into what I meant because they deleted the post.
1
My buddy was freaking out about this. He doesn’t make that much money. 😂 why do these ppl think they are rich? I don’t understand.
1
Sure. She won't get it if Democrats don't have a safe majority in Congress. But it's a great anchor.
1
Just fucking stupid
1
The ultra rich will always find a way around this.
1
Just make those captain gain not able to offset from other loss..
1
Anyone actually upset by this is just doing the bidding of the top 0.1% of the country, the ones who paid for stories to be written about it. If you’re upset, ask yourself “why?” Because you read a conservative-leaning publication wax and wain about how anti-capitalist it is? That story was paid for by a billionaire and the proposal (yes, it’s just an idea) would only affect 0.3% of the nation. It’s a nothing story. Who cares.
1
This is going to hit the average person owning a house as well and they are going to want money for you just owning a home ..I don't know why many people don't realize that she is a disaster for this country ..This whole media propaganda of her being the happy Joy party for the people is fucking stupid and we see through it
1
There’s nothing in this article or that it links to showing her saying she wants to tax unrealized gains. This is complete propaganda and misinformation
1
It’s worth noting if you on Reddit reading and posting you likely don’t make enough that this will affect you. We all safe.
1
Hell no. Once you open up this Pandora’s box, there’s no going back. Greedy politicians will lower the threshold whenever they want more drug money to buy votes and get rich from taxpayer money...Don’t believe me? Ask Hyena Kamala where they plan to reduce taxes if this does pass. That’s right, there is none! They just want more and more money!
1
Look up buy-borrow-die
1
🤣
1
My coworkers earning 80k flippin out right now.
1
Income tax was originally only for high net worth individuals too. 🫣
1
So now every trader is going to take a short sell on certain stocks because they know high net individuals hold these positions. It’ll cause a cascading effect and lower the price even more.
1
Just print the money out of thin air like we’ve been doing the last 100 years.
1
Also she is in favor of big increase on capital gains taxes and corporate income taxes.  She’s also talking about price controls a mandatory gun buy back program and not extending the current reduction in all tax rates which will be a tax increase on every American who has any job.
1
They should do it now before the elections not just the promise if they really want to do it.
1
Remember freedom taken is not just from one.   It has to start somewhere.    This one goes....we the little man will follow closely behind.
1
33 trillion in debt, how will we pay that off? No one wants to pay taxes
1
If they would literally put $100MM in the headline instead of some generic “rich folks” stand-in, this would be a non-story.
1
I hope to get to the point where this affects me.
1
For people net worth over $100,000,000 plus some other caveats. ..This tax will NEVER affect anyone who would read this su reddit.
1
The only reason i don't like this is because it complicates the tax system...Imagine pre-paying your tax (on unrealised gains) then when you sell, those unrealised gains turned out to be aloss. Then you have to seek that amount back from the government. People will need to be employed in the IRS to audit all this bs.  The tax system should be becoming simpler, not more complex and difficult to understanding...Having said that, the amount of people this applies to is very small. You need that $100m wealth, you also need at least 80% of your wealth to be liquid (they don't want you to sell your assets to pre-pay your tax). I don't know if anyone who had 100m would have 80% of their wealth liquid. My total wealth is around 150k, and i only have about 5% of my wealth liquid.
1
I will donate 5$ to neonazi group if this happens
1
How would someone like Jerry Jones pay 25% tax on his equity in the Dallas Cowboys?
1
This is mathematically impossible.
1
The billionaires would ensure the unrealized gains tax never made it through Congress because it only affects them.
1
[effacé]
1
Insane take, even if it's for the wealthy only.
1
This will drop 401(k)s. Such a dumb policy. Still, reps probably have the senate so I feel comfortable voting for her to keep the orange demon out
1
DOGE holders will be fine..lol
1
It’ll never happen, relax.
1
So can you write off unrealized losses as well?
1
High net worth individuals don't pay taxes. But it is nice to say so the commies that hate capitalism can post about it on tiktok using the newest iPhone how much they love Kamala.
1
Wouldn’t it make more sense just to get rid of the capital gains loophole?..Unrealized gains are “what would happen if I sold it all today.” 
1
She can propose all she wants. She doesn’t pass laws.
1
Y'all like her on this sub so you shouldn't really have a problem with this proposal
1
I can’t think this would pass as all her handlers would be affected.  This is just noise for votes.
1
Glad I’m not HNW!
1
Can unrealized losses be deducted?
1
Ah yes, I too love ideas that are going nowhere.
1
She’s going to need a House majority and at least 60 Senators.
1
Wrong, following the same old bullshit fake promises. Unrealized gains are vapor, tax when they are used...like a loan. That's the least disruptive thing to the market. And lest likely to be gamed when they inevitably restructure their shares. Do better. The more loopholes you have to put in for orgs that may not be individuals but to meet the criteria, the more room to dive through loop holes. Nancy Pelosi has millions, if not tebs/hundreds in unrealized gains... how many loans does she have? The billionaire tax is rage bait and a distraction, 10,000 multimillionaires slip through for focusing on one billionaire(on paper)
1
Quit "proposing" shit. If the idea is that good, send it up to Homeboy at 1600 right now and get on it. Otherwise it's just another empty campaign promise received as truth by morons.
1
Was a great conversation this morning on CNBC. Once Kamala’s policies get into the public the polls wills start to turn...Or the media will just be silent bc they hate Trump (probably rightfully so) so much
1
They gonna pay me back when I lose my ass on those stocks?
1
It’s always a slip slopping path. You can’t trust government.
1
Dumb idea, solid goal. Tax the loans against investments instead, and fix the tax code.
1
Do her billionaire donors know about this?
1
Pulling ahead potential future taxes to now to further screw over future generations. Cool.
1
This has not been officially proposed by her campaign, this was part of some Biden budget document
1
Anyone dum enough to believe she will go through with this? Its a political stunt to get votes from poor people, lol.
1
Remember income tax was only for the super rich and only temporary to finance the 1st worldwar....
1
Congrats OP you hit the moon lottery with this one
1
I always feel like when politicians propose such things they are also kind of saying, "nice wealth growth you have got here, it would be a shame if something happened to it." (i.e. pay up, or else...) And then they pay not to get taxed.
1
Why don’t they tax companies instead? Particularly those who are clearly positioned in structures abroad to purposely avoid paying tax?
1
Sure, fine. Where will all that tax money go? Are we going to send more tax dollar to Israel and not back to U.S. citizen?
1
“PROPOSES”
1
How they gonna handle social security? While the government is holding our money it is increasing in value .. that would be an unrealized gain. But, since the government is the fiduciary for these accounts, wouldn't they be responsible for paying the tax?
1
Could someone explain what this means to someone who has no idea?
1
"high net worth" is the important bit...The next most important bit is "this only impacts people with a net worth *over* $100 million".
1
Just for the record, this is how income tax and many other laws began. Just tax xyz group and as time goes on, fuck everyone 
1
I thought she was trying to win?
1
Will this force Musk, Bezos, Zuck, etc to sell 25% of their stock, thus completely crashing the price for all the normal investors and employees paid in stock?
1
Propose to break up corporations in every sector of the economy. Ones that you think shouldn't be broken up should be nationalized.../r/endFPTP
1
Love her for this.  Nail carried interest FFS!
1
This is theater, it would never get passed.
1
Unreliable source or not, you know they’d do it if they could, and eventually they would extend it down to you and I. All the while, people who contribute nothing will be in support of it, since it’s someone else’s money, after all.
1
Ah yes, the trickle down tax

That’s F’ing dumb. Stop taxing taxed money. We are taxed to death. Tax tax tax is all I hear as a small/medium business owner. Putting gains in the stock market is one of the few things we can still do and those that say it’s fine doesn’t realize how hard it is to get from middle to upper middle. And this is why. Every piece of red tape is an un needed hurdle

The line in the sand of net worth rules all of us out.

Unrealized gains,                                           ..Am I understanding this correctly it's being taxed on Stocks you have not sold?? How does that even happen  stocks go up and down???                              ..please advise
1
Do I get a refund if it turns into an unrealized loss?
1
Proposes
1
a flaw in taxing high net worth individuals' unrealized gains is that it forces them to sell assets (stocks) and the only investors who aren't facing the same new tax are corporations and foreigners...this drives the ownership class in the wrong direction.  we want American people to own our businesses, not corporations or foreigners.  a good thing is that 401ks would probably end up owning a larger percentage of the companies, but they might face serious losses as selloff happens, in the short term, as many boomers prepare enter retirement.  many might hold off retiring as a result, which is bad for the next gens of workers advancing slower.
1
lol. Welp. I thought we had the election in the bag.
1
So? I believe it’s a good thing. The uber wealthy have gotten away with too much for too long. Time to pay for all of the things that help make them rich.
1
I didn’t think this was legal at the federal level… if it was then wouldn’t losses be subjected to the same logic?
1
This would be the dumbest economic proposal, except for the fact that there is also a proposal to fix prices on food. At least taxing unrealized gains has not ever been tried in the USA and proven to be idiotic. Price fixing has and results in making the prices and supplies of items worse. ..By the way, taxing unrealized gains has been done in other countries and not surprisingly, people just move. Other countries will pay the fine to have our best entrepreneurs move to their country.
1
Do they get to deduct unrealized losses?
1
The thing about this is, it would entirely upend about a century of practices in investment management overnight. The effects would be massive and impossible to predict. The theoretical merits of the policy can be debated, but in practice, overnight, everyone would have to massively recalibrate the way they invest their money and it would be insane.
1
This plan is about as well thought out as the 'defund the police' movement. .....I probably don't even disagree with the spirit or the aim, but boy does it sound stupid and makes liberals look like idiots. 
1
And then the high net-worth individuals pack their things and take their business with them
1
Politicians will not vote against their financial interests
1
Unrealized gains directly affect the middle class for those in the back that didn't read the article. This is stated towards the end so I get it ..
1
Question - what about the donors that gave her campaign over 300 Mil within 48 hours of announcing it?
1
My understanding is that it’s actually more like mark to market. So if you’re talking a loan on your capital, which is what people currently to do avoid cap gains, your collateral obligation increases based off your purchase price on the asset.
1
Pandering only and not a snowballs chance in hell of actually happening, although it prob should
1
Why politicans are so fucking dumb lmao
1
I should preface what I am about to say with the fact that I am a Democrat....now, then. this is absolutely stupid and either she doesn't know what she is talking about, or it's to pander to some demographic. ...Given that she somehow also thought she will put price control on basic items to fix price gouging, this is very concerning indeed....It takes a basic class of economics to know that these things are not going to work out well.
1
Wealthy people like Steve Balmer will need to unload their shares of $MS to pay for the tax and it’ll impact everyone holding the stock. More reason to buy more crypto!!
1
That's going to be such a pain in the ass if it's for the common person. Does it for billionaires that's one thing...
1
So if this goes can I just keep the juicy unrealized losses and just never pay taxes again? As long as they are like more than 24%? lol
1
And? Fuck those guys 😂
1
All of this will be circumvented...When you are the country all the billionaires flock to, taxing is easy...Tax real estate, thats the only thing that will hit them, because they actually live there (and will for sure never flee to the British Virgin Islands or Dubai)…
1
High worth for the start. Then everyone. Just like in Portugal they have this tax for literally everyone. The most poor country in the EU
1
Not a good sign.
1
I dont like trump...But I also dont like candidate like who pandering to little people, knowing full well this plan will never get implemented. Not by her own party...US politics sucks.
1
Great... what exactly were the rules for deducting unrealized losses? Until that is included in any such plan, there is no way it will survive senate debate, let alone get passed into legislation.
1
This is essential, now is it to fund free college tuition.
1
Or just put a 0.5-1% tax on any liquid assets.
1
Then you should also get tax cuts for unrealised losses. It has to be a fair game.
1
Ckeyz main point is correct. The "build borrow die" strategy for never paying taxes isn't really as prevalent as you seem to think. ..Any line of credit, even if at a low subsidized rate from an investment company, is not beneficial to carry long-term because it only takes a few years for the loan interest costs to exceed a one-time capital gain tax that could have been paid. --There has to be an eventual loan payoff strategy, and "after death" is not advantageous for most from an overall wealth management standpoint. The only scenario where it arguably could make sense to never pay off a loan balance, is when borrowing against some special types of life insurance policies. But those have limitations, and other types of costs that have to be considered. ..TLDR; there's no such thing as a free lunch, for anyone
1
Maybe she’s an even greater booster than trump could be. There you go, girl!
1
How would this work? You own 50% of a company market cap 100m, it doubles in value over the year, you end up having to pay 25% out of 50m?.Meaning you have to sell 25% of your share to pay the 12.5m in taxes and quickly lose ownership of your company?
1
Poor people are so fuming right now
1
What a milquetoast ass percentage.
1
If I become a billionaire I’m gonna hate this policy!
1
I wonder how many people with less than $100 million dollars are going to be concerned about this
1
Get this cunt outa here, we need Trump to pump our bags
1
Will this apply to her and all their political handlers/benefactors? 
1
That's a bold move. Taxing unrealized gains could have significant implications, especially for investment strategies and market behavior.
1
Well, rip Nancy pelosi's net worth
1
Taxing one of the few useful places that rich people stow away their money. Brilliant.
1
These fucks are just gonna hide their money better, find some new vehicle to keep things undisclosed.  Also drawing in more money from taxes is great, but it doesn’t help that our spending it out of control, all that money is like patching a fish tank hit with buckshot. 
1
Does Nancy fall into this criteria?
1
Is also counts for everyone houses.  Is will kill the US.
1
Good luck
1
Let's tax stuff that doesn't exist. Woo!..Great idea🙄
1
Lol. She will do that!
1
Pre election quacking is what it is. She’ll do none of it. She had four years to at least bring it up. Don’t be fooled by this marionette
1
That’s sucks because high net worth starts at a million. Vs 5 and 30 million for very and ultra High NW
1
Why are we talking about taxing more when we can’t even control spending???
1
Ok, so if I had 100m or more, I could just start a holding company, and have the holding company own my stocks..Not only do I avoid the 25% tax, but I get even more tax breaks and end up saving more money.
1
This won’t help anything.
1
I'm fine with this. Soak the rich.
1
Not. Enough.
1
I can hear my boomer parents crying.
1
Ok.. good luck with this
1
If this ever trickles down the the average person it would make a market corrections absolutely fuck the economy....25% drop in real-estate, crypto + stocks and you have a net loss for the year = majority of people not paying taxes...Should just be an asset tax....2% annual of value on everything, art included
1
These progressive ideas always start out directed at ultra rich but at implementation they push it back closer to the middle class because progressives are like republicans in the 90’s—ruled by wealthy oligarchs. ..You want to increase tax revenue? Tax political donations to the Democrats.  That would bring down the debt and resulting inflation big time. You could fund Ukraine and other dumb wars.
1
Wouldn’t this only directly negatively affect Americans???  High net worth out of country invested individuals literally laughing to the bank…
1
High schoolers earning minimum wage : HELL NO
1
It should be a wealth tax. Anything over $50 million in assets (art, wine, real estate, cars, boats, etc.) should be taxed starting at 10% of the value and going up from there to 30% for anything over $1 billion in assets.
1
Communist move. She must never win

Change the 2 to a 7 and I'm Aight with it

Not everything is about money, GOD! DONT YOU PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IF WOMEN CAN GET ABORTIONS?!?!?!?!?! TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE WOMAN HATERS! - words from my ex girlfriend
1
That is definitely a start! If a person makes money or gets money then they should pay money on that. No loopholes, no tax break, you should pay if that is your way.
1
This will end up raiaing prices of everything, as the people in this catagory will pass the taxs paid on to the consumer. Poor policy
1
Good
1
Not good.

Let them do it.  Let the whales tank the market every year the day before the measuring is done.  Then it gives us all a chance to buy low.

This plan is totally unrealistic. I like Harris and will vote for her but Congress would never support such a bill. Until you sell the stock it isn’t worth anything. It could plummet in value tomorrow.
1
...only for people with over $100M in unrealized assets and that pay less than 25% effective tax rate on their income.  ..This doesn't affect anyone here.
1
Electing officials that are fiscally responsible.  Not sure they exist though.  Continually raising taxes and blaming  wealthy people only causes hatred and divisions.  A fair share would be in my opinion the same percentage across the board for all. Say that was 10%. A person earning a million dollars would pay one hundred thousand.  A person earning one hundred thousand would pay ten thousand.  No deductions, no long tax forms. Make it a national sales tax. I know not many will agree but it is fair for all.
1
Haha, hahaha, hahahahaahaha. Tax unrealized gains. Hahaha.
1
tax da rich
1
Before you get up an arms defending people with hundreds of millions maybe try defending the average Joe once in a while. Income has been effectively stagnant for 50 years (any chart you see with growth is just 2nd class citizens closing the gap). Non competes, reaganomics, destructions of unions. All of these are much more important to get riled up about..."Median Income 33-44 Year olds - 2022 Vs 50 years ago Male Income"..Male - 63,740 (1974)..|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||..Female - 46,740 (73%)..Male - 61,460 (96%)..Source - https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/time-series/historical-income-people/p08ar.xlsx..Meanwhile Real GDP growth per capita ~267%..https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1/
1
This will just cause even more money to leave the market and use shells and rat holes to evade taxes outright. This is just fleecing retail not private funds or market makers. They want everyone who is healthily invested at low cost basis brutalized and dependent on a failing currency system.
1
This most likely will not affect crypto. This is just conservative fearmongering. Crypto will remain a gray area, non investment vehicle until further notice. But there absolutely needs to be regulation for money-laundering purposes...This unrealized capital gains proposal is an attempt to cut down on billionaires and mega millionaires from borrowing cheap debt against their equity and assets, then paying below a 20% total tax rate for the year, or even below 10%. We’ve got debt problems that wealth and income inequality is making far worse.
1
I wish
1
Wouldn't it just be simpler to make turning the unrealized gain into collateral a recognition event?
1
Such a great leader
1
As with every other tax, it’s implemented with the intent of taxing the rich, then the tax code changes where the rich get exemptions and the tax trickles down and applied to everyone else.
1
The thing about that is "unrealized" is money that you don't have and didn't earn. SO Literally everyone is an unrealized billionaire and can be taxed for everything they own. They can just make up shit at this point and say you owe them.
1
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1
Who will decide what the values Will be for unrealized wealth growth?  New government agency?
1
This is insanity- guy that makes 30k and lives in a trailer park (probably)
1
The actual solution is to tax any loans as income tax for high net worth individuals if collateral is untaxed assets (like stock options or the unrealized value of stocks). But her not proposing that shows she’s just making empty promises (lying) and deflecting with a proposal that will not work, or she is and is surrounded by idiots.
1
no issue with taxing the ultra rich...if ever this will fly.
1
I'm fine with it.
1
Who gives a flying fuck what she proposes. The question is CAN she and WILL she? Probably not
1
All the politicians are probably big mad about it lol
1
cool, so why doesn’t she do it?
1
Good. I'd be happy to pay more of my millions in a fair manner if it meant helping more people and America.
1
Fuck that
1
Okay, so if your stock portfolio goes up 50% and you have to pay taxes on that 50% gain, will you then not have to pay tax when you actually withdraw it, and will the tax be refunded if your portfolio goes down again?
1
Not going to work will not happen. Ever.
1
No thanks, not voting for you. ..For those who don't understand:..If you buy a house at 100k and pay those taxes for that value when you buy the houseand then the value of that house goes to 200k. She wants you to pay taxes on the fact the value went up even though you did buy another  house, every year. Most peeps can't afford that and would have to sell the house just to pay the taxes they owe. ..She's an idiot.
1
# Who will be affected by Harris’s unrealized gains tax?..It’s worth noting that Biden’s proposed 25% tax on unrealized gains would solely affect individual taxpayers with over $100 million in net assets.
1
Yeah, if you have 100 million+ in assets only. This won't affect many.
1
Shes.. kamala harris, is dumb as a rock. Plain and simple
1
Knowing my luck. Once this will be implemented to middle class, I will have to pay the tax on my unrealized gains and then I will wait on the market to crush and sell with a loss.
1
I'm sure this will never change to include us regular folks, just like the income tax...
1
Stupid stupid stupid….
1
I wonder what the exact details of this are.  What's applicable, how is it applicable, are unrealized losses accounted for too?
1
Should be taxing loans against stock holdings as income. Also, if you decide to take pay in form of stock that stock should be taxed as income based on what it was worth when received. These are relatively easy loopholes to close.
1
Ah, I just heard about this yesterday! According to the conspiracy guy in our office, this is going to affect my sub-100k/yr household GREATLY. He told me that since my home value went from $270k to $325 in a few years, that I vote for Kamala, I will have to pay unrealized capital gains as soon as she's in office. Truly horrifying and authoritarian stuff.
1
I support this 1000%.
1
It’s about goddamn time
1
Who cares? You thinking taxing the rich will benefit you? No, it will benefit the government to misspend and mismanage more money. You will never see a dime.
1
You’re full of you know what. Nowhere has she even come close to proposing this! Fake news!  😆
1
TLDR;..Kamala wants to wreck the market.
1
That is amazing.
1
Is Nancy Pelosi part of that list?
1
How would this impact the stock market and what is considered high net worth? ..If it causes a mass sell off that would be an issue possibly 
1
Didn't do anything as vice-president. Don't get fooled by the democratic media that is pushing her hard. Use your brain folks.
1
Starts at 100million. Then 10 million. Then 500 thousand. It will creep into the middle class before you realize. Taxing unrealized gains is a huge encroachment of anyone, even ultra wealthy.
1
An idea that very likely wont go anywhere, or at the very least survive the courts. She is going to have a hard time getting your average person to understand what 'realized gains' are. All they will be presented with is 'tax the rich'...Everyone agrees that the tax code is horrendous as it is. Yet the attempts at a highly simplified tax code dont go very far. Both sides say its unfair and the other side is getting a pass.
1
So says the empty vessel …
1
This is theft
1
Hell, she could make it 50% and they still wouldn’t feel it.
1
Idiocy. If the asset crashes the gov makes refunds?  How to credit unearned losses?  What about housing prices caused by inflation?  Who set the market value when there is no sale?  Etc..
1
i'm not high net worth and i would assume the majority of you aren't either so i don't really care and neither should you.

FYI - this is a common democrat tag line for election time.  She doesn’t want to actually do it, but rich people bad is a good way to get votesz

The RMD Required Minimum Distribution from IRA accounts is already in place. It forcesmiddle class Americans to pay tax on unrealized gains in IRA accounts. This is FACT! ❤️💰🇺🇸

None of you will be affected by that law btw

This is an awful plan. Anyone who thinks she will stop with the "wealthy" is naive.
1
so one day you have 1m profit on a memecoin, owe 500k tax, next day I baghold to 9000, still owe 500k tax. sell house, car....broke...jail....what nonsense is that tax?
1
What a dunce
1
Bad
1
Wouldn’t mind ending the social security cap
1
The Private Credit line referred to here is expensive money-  high rates on these loans- forcing to tax people for taking risk and being rewarded with returns risking the downside is wrong- then if we access this money for quick cash with a line of credit (LOC) then we should be taxed on that as well?  Less economic activity = less tax revenue.  Everyone wants someone else to pay taxes except themselves.  Tax the poor who pay nothing- here comes the tsunami of downvotes!  .Just retire and make less money- and less tax revenue - or stop moving money around exposing it to taxes- it isn’t like people won’t change their behavior based on tax incentives
1
Did anyone see a dime of Elon Musk's tax money? ($11 billion).  Oh that's right, Biden forgave all those student loans so the banks got all of that money.
1
This is a ploy like everything else they do. Making it seem like they tax the rich when they’re going after money not even made yet to offset the spending and inflation they caused while always putting the same banks families and brokers ahead of the public. The Democratic Party supporters have lost all critical thinking skills.

insane policy lmao

Empty talk.. Remember Biden talking about the unfair taxation policy between wage income and capital gains income...What happened?  He got so quiet so suddenly..
1
How do you tax a gain if it hasn’t been realized yet? What if you pay the tax but you end up with a loss before you have sold it but have paid the tax as if it was a gain. Wouldn’t that force those high net individuals to make fewer investments. In new businesses which in turn put a huge damper on growing the economy?
1
This is a slippery slope... Today it's 100m in assets, a decade from now it's 1m in assets which many Americans possess and probably don't think about.
1
Anyone in here got over $100 million in net assets?  If you don't now, you likely never will...so this isn't an issue that you need to worry about.  Let billionaires pay their share.
1
I think 50 would be better

Stupid fucking idea. More economic destruction following the Biden presidency.

Everyone keeps saying “it’s only for those who have over $100m” why is anyone a fan of the Us government taking more money from citizens? Have they ever been fiscally responsible before? Why would it suddenly change when they do this?

Tax the rich, then eat them.

Everyone who keeps saying it won’t impact them. Doesn’t understand that this will have a trickle down effect and will punch all the way down to the lowest class. Absolute idiocy. It’s like hacking the truck of a tree and all the leaves saying ‘WE are FINE, I don’t feel an AXE at all!’ ..Then suddenly the whole tree falls in a river. Total bobble heads here.

unrealized gains tax in general is NOT GOOD for anyone or anything!  it'll destroy the economy, and it's communism.  Banks will be forced to increase their high interest rates, food production companies will be forced to charge more, gas companies will be forced to charge more.  even MORE companies will be forced to shut down, causing scarcity in food, gas, and jobs.  aka INFLATION will go parabolic.  KLOWNMALA IS DUMB AND COMMUNIST.  ..also don't believe klownmala, first it's 'only for the rich' and then she will secretly pass 'for everybody' just like what they've always done with anything else, including obamacare...Trump:  dodges bullets..Klownmala:  dodges questions.

So when the shares of a company belonging to a founder become worth more than $100 mil, the founder has to start selling shares just to pay taxes? That will at best limit US business growth, could even force many businesses to fold. This also smells a lot like underhanded nationalization tactic. High net-worth individuals often take loans against their unrealized gains to start new businesses, now that money will go to Uncle Sam, who has proven time and time again to be a horrible business operator (compare NASA to SpaceX, USPS vs Fedex, etc.).
1
so in order to be mad about this you need 1) gains, 2) to make over 100 million USD and 3) not have enough money to pay the tax
1
step 1:  'unrealized gains tax will ONLY affect rich people.'..step 2:  'unrealized gains need to also apply to businesses too, that's only fair.'..step 3:  increase prices dramatically..step 4:  destroy businesses, the economy, and jobs...step 5:  you're going to be a homeless fuck while the illegals will be complaining to the police about how you are a nuisance to their homes that they got with your money..  but at least the rich got what they deserved!  take that, rich people!

Imagine thinking that giving more money to people who spend it like heroin addicts is a good thing. The pentagon hasn't passed an audit in YEARS. ..And before the "this doesn't affect you" crowd shows up, it affects your boss. And if it affects your boss, one day he might make some changes, and those changes might be you...So maybe have some principles even if it's not your tax bracket.
1
Yeah but when it’s done it will end up affecting the middle class the worst.
1
For HIGH NET no one here has any worry unless you’re rich af which is doubtful
1
Get the full facts:..It applies only to individuals with at least $100 million in wealth who do not pay at least a 25% tax rate on their income (inclusive of unrealized capital gains). Payments can be spread out over subsequent years...Within that $100 million club, you’d only pay taxes on unrealized capital gains if at least 80% of your wealth is in tradeable assets (i.e., not shares of private startups or real estate). One caveat for this illiquid group is that there would be a deferred tax of up to 10% on unrealized capital gains upon exit...Source: https://www.axios.com/2024/08/23/kamala-harris-unrealized-capital-gains-tax

If elon could leverage unrealized gains in his stock to buy twitter, he should have to accept a tax on it too:) rich people can’t bargain with unrealized gains and take no ownership of them otherwise
1
Will those high net-worth get their money back when the stock market tank? Most those net-worth are just "wealth on paper" and not the money in the bank. It's value change daily with the stock market movement.  Can you imagine what those tax can do to a company stock or stock market when those high net-worths need to sell their shares to pay for taxes on those "on paper unrealized gain" ?..If they really want to eliminated the tax cheat on high net-worth, they should look at how to tax people who use their stocks as collateral for a loan to get cash instead of selling their shares to avoid capital gains. Close those loopholes....This country is running by morons and idiots, smh.

Let them figure out how to spend less first..Literally the entire net worth of all US billionaires couldn’t even fund the entire country for a year.  All this asking for “more taxes” is distracting from the real problems: Overspending and inflation
1
The dumbest proposal ever! Good way to crash the economy and the market!
1
This is a horrible idea. The same people she is claiming to protect will be the ones to suffer. As far as the articles claim to lower our deficit. I mean, we could do something far more simple. Like, I don't know, funding other people's wars and giving illegal immigrants more benefits than people who actually pay taxes 🤷🏽. Also, I would love to understand how this would be implemented. When would the tax apply and at what frequency. It would be nice if they just published her policies already so people could read it and decide for themselves.
1
Heavy cope in this thread. This isn't "only going to tag high net worth individuals," and even if it did, it's still asinine and arguably unethical, not to mention a major departure from basic economic practice. ..As hard as it might be for some of you to understand or admit, we need rich people (yes, big scary boogie men), who understand tax law and economic dynamics. This is, plain and simple, democratic fiscal policy approaching its final form, taxing ghost money because you rubes buy that it's "eat the rich" season. ..Please stfu and stop in any way suggesting this idea is a good one by any stretch of the imagination.

“Economic consequences of the proposed unrealized gains tax plans seem far-reaching, as the combination of the corporate tax of 28%, unrealized gains tax of 25%, and 44.6% capital gains tax would make the U.S. the world’s highest total tax rate on corporate income in the developed world”

It's hard to explain to unsmart people who yell tax the billionaires, want to tax unrealized gains because it won't affect them...I mean middle class yellers have 401k plans that will tank as the rich stop investing , and all the union people with pensions won't have money for their pensions either.
1
Taxation is theft. The problem with the left is they want to always take and it doesn’t go anywhere it’s supposed to because big government. Easy example is Cali giving illegals our hard earned money. People voted for these idiots to give the tax money to the public as in their citizens. Imagine where this money will go. Oh and who drives the market ? Oh ya these rich mother fuckers. So they pull their cash out and everyone loses. It’s just a stupid idea all around
1
High net worth being 100 million dollars or more. The vast majority of people here aren't affected
1
This is an absolutely awful idea. This government has the most atrocious track record of saying they will tax rich only to have it destroy everyone down the line. The income tax was only for richest citizens and was suppose to be capped at 3% when it was introduced. Now everyone pays out the rear for income tax poor or rich. And definitely more than 3%

“High net worth” means us…

Taxing gains you haven’t even realized is CRAZY

I’m pretty liberal but this is no good.

> Another impracticality of the proposed unrealized gains tax would be estimating the amount to be taxed, as it is hard to determine the exact amount of appreciation or depreciation of a specific asset. This would result in gruesome work for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)...Boy howdy is that the fact.
1
Won't make it past the courts. Not sure why this is a talking point. If, by a miracle, it does then you will see the greats outflow of money in the history of the country to other countries.

That basically force people to sell that fucks everyone but stupid woman proposing stupid shit new taxes that will fuck the economy why they don’t simply spend less
1
Income tax also started on “only the rich”. Did we really learn nothing from our history?
1
Screw it make it 30
1
Sounds great. Except Congress still thinks it's 1972 and 100k/yr is "high net worth".
1
Either we tax rich people more so that we don’t have to tax poor people more or we pay people more at the bottom but at the same time have to pay people at the top less otherwise it will just cause inflation. Taxing is really the only option.
1
This is the dumbest idea ever...1. How do you even calculate that? Values fluctuate every second of every minute..2. This would remove any incentive for anyone to hold stocks, bonds, metals, or property...resulting in massive devaluation and economic instability..3. Start a shell company -> company holds the assets -> absolute tax avoidance
1
Good do it!!! Tax the shit out of the wealthy!!!

Fine Print:..“The most significant tax increase in 40 years would still impact the working class, which Harris promised to protect from tax hikes.”

Today’s Democrats only seek power and will say anything to get it. They hurt people so much...50% of people pay no tax. Democrats have bought this constituency using money from productive people. Productive people who actually fund the government are forced to fund their own persecution...Only those who pay to fund the federal government should get to vote and have a say in how it’s run. See how fast things change.

If reading or commenting in this thread, you don’t have to worry about this tax.
1
Just the start…
1
What a stupid thing to do. Companies and high net worth can go wherever and keep the bare minimum to avoid paying this. It's far better to have them in the US than for them to take the assets elsewhere
0
It’s for those that have $100M and ONLY pay tax on unrealized gains if at least 80% of your wealth is tradable assets. This only affects super wealthy hedge fund manager type people. It’s “to address substantial inequalities in our tax system.” This is a good thing.

Good.

No one here in this thread is going to get anywhere close to $100M+ in gains, so we should stop bending over backwards to stand up for billionaires trying to weasel their way out of taxes.

Did you know that the US income tax was only imposed on high net-worth individuals when it was enacted in 1913? Now everyone is subject to it. If you think the government won't "trickle down" these taxes to your average American, you don't know our history...It's funny that neither party is discussing just cutting the budget by at least 5%. If we did that, we'd balance the budget in 10 years.
0
All of the passive aggressive "Good thing there aren't any high net-worth individuals here" comments are ridiculous right now....So just because an issue doesn't involve you, should you not care? How much more selfish could you be?

Taxing money that someone hasn’t made yet is dumb af.  They keep trying to get more tax money to solve problems they will not end up solving.  There is a huge problem in this country and thats govt spending. California spent billions on homelessness and the problem got worse.  When asked where the money went they didn’t know.  How do you lose billions of dollars.  The military couldn’t account for trillions of dollars spent and now the govt wants more money, and they paint it as “if you don’t want more tax you don’t care about people”. Well the govt has a long track record of wasting money, that’s why I don’t want anyone to have to pay more in taxes.  More taxes=more money politicians can line their pockets with.

Haha like that proposal will get passed. I’m all for the super wealthy paying more in taxes, but after reading the article the numbers sound excessive. Meaning less likely to get passed...Also what wasn’t clear is what if those people have unrealized losses. Can they claim that money back? ..In Denmark we have that in place regardless of how much you make. You pay taxes or can claim back taxes based on unrealized gains or losses.
-1
This means absolutely nothing to 99.99% of the population. Why are you acting like it is some crazy thing we all need to worry about?

Please emphasize that this only affects people with $100 Million and are already paying less than 25% income tax. .The ultra wealthy who cheat the tax system to pay less % than anyone else. Yes, tax them.

It’s all for show .. the way giant corporations have been dodging taxes, I doubt any of those rich twat will be caught in this.. whoever designed the tax scheme would have loopholes for them already. Watch this space.

I think this misses the actual target but I won’t dunk on it. It’s a step in the right direction. ..There needs to be some fairness and the current way in which people with very, very, high net worth can use paper gains as collateral to obtain cheap debt used de facto as income and essentially avoid taxation is fundamentally unfair.

It’s actually kit such a silly idea. But implementing it is tough. .Gary Stevenson, who economist and.ex banker (was worlds top banker and has made a ton of cash!) has a bunch of useful suggestions in how to tax the rich.

I've looked into what Biden was wanting to do which is from my understanding similar to what she wants to do and it sounds messy. However they end up doing it the majority of people will not have to pay into that and the wealthy will just find a loophole.

This obviously won't work.  What are you going to do when people lose those unrealized gains?  Give them their money back?  You'd be better off making a law that you can't take a loan out against unrealized gains, which is what rich people do to get around the taxes.

It is a bad tax. Opening that door is bad. It will start with high net worth, then like Gavin Newsome and Pantera Bread, they will make exceptions like baking bread and make the tax system so complicated that the tax will only impact the opposing political party.  Not trying to be political but that is the point that dictator governments make exceptions for their key people.

It's fine until you realize that it's cheaper for the government to come after middle class and poorer Americans because the rich have better lawyers. ..So they implement a tax on unrealized income (which is sketchy) then decide fuck it, let's tax unrealized wealth for everyone; that increase in your home you finally managed to buy will now be taxed, the increased value of any of the few stocks you cobble together or your 401k gets taxed, cuz fuck you you don't have a lawyer on speed dial

This would only apply to a small percentage of them. Lots of loopholes to get out of it. The thing is, unless we really rein in the billionaire class, given time they will buy absolutely everything. I would be much happier if we had an extremely low tax on people who make under 50k. Less than 10% state and federal combined. Under 20% up to 200k, maybe even 300k, all of the workplace deductions come back. The tax rate doesn't start getting high until you're making over a million a year or 50 million in assets by the time you hit 100 million in assets or 5 million a year, maybe 10 million a year somewhere in there, you have an extremely restrictive tax bracket which will prevent the runaway wealth accumulation. If we just do the rule of 72. How many years would it take before Elon musk and Bill Gates could literally be buying cities? That's the problem. Compounding 10,000 to 20,000 is great, how about a hundred billion to 200 billion. Now you're rivaling countries
0
Oh, look, the crypto idiots are talking about things they don't understand and pretending like they'll have $100 million some day...Oh wait, now the story is about it being part of a bigger conspiracy to tax poor people more in their made-up scenario for the future...I bet you guys get scared when a shadow moves in your room, lol

Once you learn the history of income tax, you’ll realize that in 20 years all of our retirements and investments will be taxed on their gains as well. You open the door for them by allowing it on billionaires, it’s only a matter of time till they come after you and I. And just like income tax and accountants, the billionaires will be able to afford high end appraisers and fight valuations in court for years. You and I won’t have that luxury and we’ll become easier targets for the IRS, just like we are now with income tax. This is a god awful idea

Let's be honest, this has NOTHING to do with 99% of us lol..."It’s worth noting that Biden’s proposed 25% tax on unrealized gains would solely affect individual taxpayers with over $100 million in net assets...Furthermore, in outlining the new tax plan, Biden assured that individuals earning less than $400,000 annually would not face tax hikes."

Fine by me, my networth is not high (nor am I in the US). But what they should do is fix the tax codes so they're not a complete joke. ..IN World War 2, the top tax bracket for the rich reached something like 95%. That's where it should be now for earnings beyond a couple mill on the outside.

It’s almost like this is too stupid to actually happen. Every tax season the entire market would crash. High worth individuals are forced to sell positions to pay taxes, positions they would hold if not for this new tax. When high worth individuals sell it creates fear and the markets dip even lower. Every single year. There would be no more growth.

Can we all just stop brainstorming new ways to tax people, because we all know this won’t just be “high net-worth individuals”… those people can afford to live wherever they want, why would they live somewhere they pay more tax?

I fully support this, if your net worth is over $100M you can easily handle this, and the bottom line is we need to close the budget deficit without continuing to demolish the middle class. Making the budget work is difficult but necessary, and this is a logical way to do it.

tldr; Vice President Kamala Harris supports President Joe Biden's tax plan, which includes a 25% tax on unrealized gains for individuals with over $100 million in net assets, aiming to generate $5 trillion in revenue over a decade. This plan is part of a broader strategy to address the U.S. deficit and debt, ensuring high-net-worth individuals contribute a fairer share. It also proposes increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, which, combined with other taxes, could position the U.S. as having the highest total tax rate on corporate income in the developed world. The plan faces potential challenges in Congress, even with a Democratic majority...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

I am a tax lawyer and a progressive. I also find Don-Old to be a lawless, incompetent, repugnant moron. So I support Harris...With that said, there are other simpler, more efficient ways to get more revenue from the filthy rich...Some have been listed here...The important thing is she gets elected and dems control both houses so we can then craft policies followed by strong legislation to right the ship...Republicans have shown that when they have any power whatsoever, they will abuse it...For example, the filibuster. The filibuster is not in the Constitution. It is anachronism from a time when Republicans acted in good faith. They have perverted it and created an anti-democratic, obstructionist blockade to all legislation—even stuff they agree with since getting something done is viewed as a win fir democrats.

>100 million in assets..Honestly, if you're one of the people saying "if they go after the extremely rich, it's only a matter of time before they go after the poor too", I immediately think you're:..A) extremely rich.B) an idiot fooled by an extremely rich person / figurehead.C) A bot..The last time there was this much wealth inequality in a country, heads were rolling in the street. The current system - isn't working!

Yahoo Finance had a good article yesterday about SBLOC, it’s a margin loan secured by the stocks. It’s a revolving credit line that never gets paid back. All of the cash people “borrow “ isn’t taxed. They don’t even pay capital gains in most cases. This is how the wealthy get away with zero taxes.
639
This is the actual problem and I don't know why they haven't done this already....Taking out a loan against an asset *is* realizing at least some part of it.
142
I think this is where it will end up, it's just not as easily digested as a headline...Perhaps also putting a limit on step-up cost basis.
13
That is an actual non insane solution
6
Yeah this unrealized gains tax is so silly, better take on it for sure
102
This sounds good. As un realised gain used for collaterals are essentially realised gains. This is much fairer.
20
Do you get a tax refund when your collateral value dumps and you get margin called on the loan?   ...Mids who think these schemes are risk-free money generators for the wealthy vote.  A good argument against democracy.
6
Bro, you should be running for president or something
2
Money printer will still go brrr

Wouldn't they then just take out two 500k loans and avoid the tax?
2
From a negotiating POV their current stance makes this an easy “compromise” if it’s really the intended goal.  If they start with this, it’ll be some watered down meaningless BS by the time it passes
1
This I would be much more receptive to than actually just taxing unrealized  capital gains. The solves the problem to having to sell something you never intended to to cover the taxes, The issue about other assets that could be seen as capital gains like your house or your card collection or your cryptocurrency or who knows what else that you had never intended to sell or make money off of but we're forced to to cover the gains, and this one also help get rid of the issue of what about the losses because it would only occur when you triggered a loan event using on capitalized gains as collateral.
1
thats clever af
1
> Taxing loans that use unrealized gains as collateral would be far more effective. ..by taxing unrealized gains you force them to move the money in a way that is taxed less.
1
This guy tax policies
1
That’s smart.  Taxing unrealized gains is kind of crappy, speaking as someone who is not seeing any unrealized gains in any way.  But if they are taking out loans against that as a substitute for income, it absolutely should be taxed.
1
This
1
This would be, but they don't want people even knowing this is a real thing rich people do. Much easier to say Jeff Bezos has made $$$ but isn't paying taxes on it because he hasn't sold his shares. Taxing unrealized gains would hurt everyone, but 0% chance it happens. She's just pandering.
1
Another one would be taxes on shares execs receive as part of their salary structure. ..If a payout or performance bonus exceeds $100K as cash and shares kick off the marginal tax rate. So, 10% on the first $100K. With a top marginal tax rate of 75% on bonuses that exceed a combined total of $10M. ..Furthermore, this is tied to their *GLOBAL* INCOME. So, if they receive $100K in cash and 4.9M in shares, they get taxed at the $5M tax rate. Even if 3.75M was earned in British Virgin Islands, they're taxed at the $5M rate.
1
People say it's impossible to tax them and here is a great way to close that loophole. Imagine if you did this for a living.

Lower property taxes on homes owned by people not companies.

I like how you think they want to fix it. Name of the game is to make it look like fixing it without changing anything.
1
This minus the tax breaks. The amount of money that goes just to debt payments by the government is getting out of hand. We really should look to get to a balanced budget or at least take steps in that direction. (Not for cutting benefits but rather for returning to previous tax structures to make up this tax revenue shortfall)
1
Loan interest is already taxed.
1
More like just make that outright illegal...It's absolutely insane how much fake wealth is extracted from unrealized gains. The stock market is in such a massive bubble because no one ever really has to sell.
1
1. aren't the people who do this paying interest on the loan? .2. Wouldn't it be better to help people get into the middle class rather than support those who are already there?
1
"Then use that income to give middle class additional tax breaks on owning property, lower student loan rates and expanded child tax credit."..Says who?
1
Now this is an idea
1
Fair
1
Go to Whitehouse.gov and post this.
1
Banning corporate buybacks of stocks is even more effective. Make dividends the only way to return cash to the investor. Tax dividends how you see fit.  The only reason this unrealized gain loan bullshit works is because of corporate buy backs, and Reagan and the rich cronies in the 80s knew that at the time which is why they got rid of the stock buyback ban.
1
lol that money is going straight to Raytheon and Lockheed
1
But that would prevent the next crash from happening whenever the union of the rich and recently overleveraged decide to unleash the secret that speculation on high risk derivatives will create a cascade of defaults
1
I think to prevent consolidation of wealth and power we shouldn't allow borrowing beyond your basis regardless of unrealized gains, thus forcing people to sell so they don't eventually own everything.
1
Taxing unrealized gains solves the issue of billionaires sitting on wealth for tax reasons. Now they have no reason not to realize those gains.
1
This is bs
1
Isn't the middle class dead though? No point giving a person something if they are in the cemetary..
1
More taxes isn't the problem government wasting taxes is
1
Well, technically, to the extent that they borrow beyond the original purchase price of the asset, they have effectively realised a gain, that could reasonably be taxed...Borrowing up to that purchased price is just securing a loan.
1
That’s literally what the proposed tax is lol…..And only for $100M+..No one here would be negatively effected
1
I was here to say basically this. You started a company with 0$, it is worth a billion and you own 100%. You take out a loan against those shares of 10 million. Congrats, that 10 million is now considered realized and you must pay tax on it. If you sell 10 million dollars of shares in the future, the 10 million that you loaned will be deducted against the capital gains. ..You get a business loan to expand or renew some portion of the business. Well, that wouldn't be against you personally so you would not be hurt. But again we would need to make sure there isn't people taking advantage of this that is why we need a good department that can properly investigate these things. ..Easy Peasy. You don't get to hide income behind loans.
1
We're not dealing with the smartest or most honest and genuine people here.
1
Look they already print so much money, we don't even need an income tax. Stop printing and preserve the middle class wealth and purchasing power. ..We have a government spending problem.
1
This guy fucking finances. You for Treasury Secretary, my dude.
1
This is the way
1
Just make anything that has a real effect realized. If you use your "unrealized" gains as collateral, they're realized. Done.
1
No it wouldn't. Elon Musk has unrealised gains in the hundreds of billions but the amount he is personally borrowing to live on is probably a few billion at most.
1
It's actually a lot simpler than that. US normal folks are not taxed on unrealized gains in investments because us poor folks have 401ks. US middle class folks are *already* taxed on unrealized gains via property tax. It already fucking happens. And yeah, please tax my unrealized gains on my unprotected account! Do it. It's fucking simple and anyone who segues otherwise is simply misinformed.
1
This.  This right here.  Loans by anyone with an insane amount of money is ludicrous.  Yes they’re the safest to give loans to, but they also don’t need them.
1
They are taking in 3 times more federal tax revenue than they did in 2000 (per FRED). Revenue isn’t the problem.
1
That would be better...Also force banks to report all collateralized real property to the government. ..To eliminate people saying an asset is worth $X for tax purposes but worth $Y for collateral purposes.
1
Before implementing more taxes, how about we consider reducing unnecessary spending and avoiding overpaying companies or businesses that raise the costs of their products or services they provide when it comes to government contracts? Fuck taxes
1
Sounds like a good idea, I’m sure our exceptionally smart representatives could hash this out in a reasonable manner that is fair, while not being economically irresponsible. ..Just kidding she’s a communist DOA.
1
Yah I agree… unrealized gains aren’t guaranteed so it seems really weird to tax them, but the minute you use them as collateral, that should set a realized value of the equity and they should be taxed on the gains from basis. It’s only fair.
1
Go run for president
1
I am an idiot… how does this logically make sense since “unrealized” gains/loses changes daily…. Each year it will go up or down and will there be some tax credit if it is below the unrealized level from the prior year??? Or is it added to the insignificant 3k limit
1
It’s sad where we have come to as a society.  Accepting more taxes and you know damn well that money won’t be used to help anyone else, just more funny money for the government.  A small tax on tea created a revolution, but now this on top of so many other taxes is being considered.
1
How do people pay the loans back in this scheme?
1
Zero chance this happens. They don’t want to do this. They want to capture your assets.
1
Incredible how a reddit user has a better solution than a presidential candidate.

This sounds super interesting, any information in particular you'd point to to further read on this
1
You act like she's actually doing it for some greater good. ..If it can't be gamed, it wouldn't be proposed. ...Never vote for someone based on a promise. Look at their past actions.
1
This would be the best way. And I believe if they went to this path during the proposal they will end up coming up to this conclusion. ..But with so many investors on both sides of the house I don’t think this sort of tax will ever pass. 
1
I own 500,000,000 in stock unrealized gains with a cost basis of 1,000,000. I take loans against it so never sell a dime. ...I die. I pass it to my children. Their cost basis is 500,000,000. ...There is no capital gains tax ever paid on the amount and the children get it tax free. ...Love being rich lol
1
That's a great way to drive loan service outside the jurisdiction of the US.
1
Hey, hey. Who told you that you can go around making sense like that?
1
pretend this comment is me giving you a ton of awards. her campaign needs to see this. you are correct
1
Man banks must love you. That's one way to get money to back the proposal
1
>Then use that income to give middle class additional tax breaks on owning property, lower student loan rates and expanded child tax credit....I think we all know what that extra income will be used for... smarter bombs and dumber cops. 
1
You know not what you speak. You cannot tax a liability.
1
I think that is the plan
1
Or just tax the wealth directly?. Not sure how taxing a loan borrowed against wealth is going to be simpler.
1
I really hope that’s the fine tuning they lay out in their interview tomorrow.  ..Even though this would only effective 0.001% of the population I could see this and the price “gauging” idea being deal breakers for the upwardly mobile. 
1
Yep this is one of the big ways the ultra rich get out of paying taxes
1
So much this. ..Personally, I don’t think banks should be allowed to extend loans on securitized collateral. Thats precisely how many of the richest people make oodles of cash. They get a billion dollars in stock. They take out a billion dollar loan with the stock as collateral. Because the stock is not yet sold, there’s no tax on it as unrealized. The loan is not income so there’s no tax. They pay something like 2% interest on the cash, and invest the rest that end up making like 8-10% p.a. AND the stock they had they still keep which likely also appreciates while they have it. It’s fucking brilliant. But it’s also criminally legal and it needs to stop now.
1
Epic suggestion that’s how they get away with everything- loans
1
> Then use that income to give ~~middle class additional tax breaks~~ themselves a bonus and additional paid vacations and other perks...FTFY...That's what will end up happening to that money
1
I don’t believe you know what you’re talking about.
1
No chance that old be passed on to the middle class lol
1
Yes let's tax the loans people take with their stocks as collateral. This is the way. That's a form of income in the end.
1
Tax both
1
Oh yeah a tax on interest rates. That will be productive for society.
1
You're not thinking of how your system can fuck over the little people tho. Sorry we can't have that
1
They’ll never do that. It actually solves problems.
1
Why not both?
1
The very idea that someone could use unrealized gains as collateral is absurd and "rules for thee, not for me". It's like saying "Loan me money, and I promise, i PROMISE it will make money to pay you back with. I don't actually have any money to pay you back with yet, but the loan will pay for itself."..Meanwhile, small people have more reasonable rules, like an expectation of income and/or credit score that can show the ability to pay.
1
I like that idea
1
More effective and just generally less crazy. We should never start the trend of taxing unrealized gains. Even if we are starting with the rich
1
What if my property value goes up, then what? Am I taxed on that?
1
Yes but that would actually solve the problem, instead of just pretend to solve the problem. And we aren’t doing that in politics.
1
Translation: it’s an absolutely unrealistic shit idea by her
1
who says they're not gonna implement it in a way like this?
1
From what I’ve seen, there would essentially be a wealth snapshot on a predetermined date (December 31st?). I had to do some digging on this because it sounded so insane. Only for 100m+ individuals (or so they say).
44
I mean, that's how hedgefunds make money, they make it work
5
Would allow writeoff with losses. Also, it's gains in a year I assume? You would have to be investing billions for this to matter. 
2
I get taxed on the unrealized gains for my house. It's not really a new concept.
3
Well, you see it wouldn’t work. But it sounds really good to stupid people that she wants to appeal to.
1
[effacé]
-1
Not that it will ever apply to me, but I have to think that if people with over $100 mil are getting taxed on unrealized gains, then they will be able to claim unrealized losses. At which point they will have a new tool for tax manipulation. Because everyone’s portfolio at that scale has plenty of losses mixed into the gains. ..Presently they have to sell those losses to realize them for offsetting other realized gains. But it may be possible that they can keep holding stocks that have had a bad year, and offset realized capital on sold assets that would have needed to be taxed already. Like I’ve got BofA stock and it tanks, but I also sold a building and made bank. Now I get to keep my position in BofA and offset the captain gains tax from the building’s profits...It may be less work to do more cheating...I do appreciate all of the push to tax the Uber rich, but they also need to tax Uber rich companies more, or not just more, but eliminate the manipulation of costs / profits to get million dollar projects to zero out on the balance sheets.
34
I think it pertains to liquid gains over a billion dollars sitting in stock to avoid paying taxes and taking out loans to again avoid paying taxes
5
Apparently yeah
4
Yes, if you’re a high negative net wealth individual. Net worth must be less than negative $100 million dollars
1
The more important question is how will unrealized gains for private businesses be calculated? There are some venture (tech/AI) investments worth billions but they haven’t generated a cent in profits.
1
No. This isn't a gotcha, the answer is just no. Thank you for playing. If you failed that hard you took a risk too big. You don't get to play that game anymore, back to the McDonalds fry station. This should encourage businesses to operate more sustainably.

This won't apply to you
1
lol. Good one. I’m personally just short by $100 million, so I’m fine. I’ll miss the cut. Got worried there for a sec.

The people who complain about this think that someday, their net worth will be $100 million. They really think that, and in the meantime, they vote against their interests.

Just wait 5 years. Once this fails to have the desired result, it’ll be for the middle income people. Just like income taxes.
5
That part — high net worth individuals — needs to be mentioned and defined every single solitary time this is mentioned in interviews, debates, conversations, etc...Conservative media will undoubtedly leave that out with statements like “That’s right folks, you finally get one foot on the ladder, the S&P 500 has a good year, and the liberals come for their 25% because they can’t keep their greedy hands off of it.”
2
This guy gets it
1
They will set a line for high net worth individuals. Then, they will lower that line slowly until everyone is paying. Just like income taxes were only supposed to be a temporary tax for the wealthy to help pay for the war......It's easy to laugh it off saying,  "they think they will be rich one day, haha". However,  it will affect you. It's not about becoming rich one day. Even if your finances never increase, the bar will lower, guaranteed, until you're affected.  Government spending appetite has no end. 
1
It would crash the market though
1
Exactly, there is nothing wrong with this...Right?..Wrong...They are setting the precedent...This is how it starts. It is an incremental process. It starts with "tax people with 100mil or more, who cares, we don't have that so it doesn't affect us, blah blah blah" but next thing you know, once the precedent has been set, it becomes more acceptable to tax people in the 50-100mil range, then the 25-50mil range, and so on, until we ourselves are staring this situation in the face...As I said, these people do not care about you. They are tricking you. Do not take the bait.
1
That’s not the issue.. the issue of that if this passes there is a high likelihood that it will eventually effect normal people too, and that is bad
1
When first established, the income tax only affected a very small percentage of high earners.  .How's that working out for us?..History shows us that the premise used to lure us into a tax is rarely the long term truth.

First they came for millionaires with inheritances of 13 million or more to tax them. Then they stopped there except for indexing it for inflation to raise it every year.

Does the median household borrow money on unrealized gains? Not sure bit i always thought the bank would only do this if its worth it and they are certain to get it back.

I didn’t realize there are so many people worth over 100M in this subreddit. THeY wIL CoMe fOR mY MoNeY neXT. That is a stupid argument. Relax, I don’t think they want your chump change. It’s time for the rich to pay back to society.
2
this quote you've malformed originates from the fact that when these types of injustices happen they happen to people of similar social standing so it encourages people to stand up for each other. millionaires and billionaires will never defend the poor working class and vice versa (although given trump supporters I realize my premise is kinda shaky)

This is so out of touch lmao

by the time everyone else gets done selling to pay their unrealized gains taxes, and then selling more to pay the realized gains.....for sure you won't have any gains left. 100%..but don't worry, you can write off $3k against your income each year.

Lol politicians targeting loopholes is a good way to say politicians opening more loopholes
14
It’s a hamfisted, poorly considered approach to closing those loopholes. Does the U.S. gov really want to get into the business of taxing, then refunding, then taxing, and on and on each year as asset values fluctuate?..The bill is unlikely to pass because it was never serious - just an attempt to pander to leftist voters.
43
law will only apply to the rich first, Then after couple years, they will revise and start applying to lower classes too. Income tax was 6% for the wealthy and 1% for lower class back in 1900 something. Look at us now. Once the law is passed. They will keep on pulling the rope..And people who downvote me, yall trying to eat kamala's ass or something?

Most people worth that don’t have the money sitting in a bank account and most of it is in companies not registered in their country (the US in this case).  The sentiment may be good but the proposal on its face is useless.

Did you know that the US income tax was only imposed on high net-worth individuals what it was enacted in 1913? Now everyone is subject to it. If you think the government won't "trickle down" these taxes to your average American, you don't know our history. ..It's funny that neither party is discussing just cutting the budget by at least 5%. If we did that, we'd balance the budget in 10 years.

It stops individuals from owning mega companies.  Elon’s capital gain taxes would’ve forced him to sell shares in Tesla that he couldn’t hold on to his company.  The top US companies are all where they are from the early leaders taking it up...Google, Microsoft,, facebook, walmart, Amazon

1
Ok, so Tesla stock skyrockets. Elon is now worth a trillion up from 400 billion. He has to pay taxes on 600 billion in unrealized gains. How does he get that cash? Sell 150 billion in tesla stock? The stock price plummets because you literally can't sell that much without tanking it.

>It's likely never gonna pass, and is more of a bargaining chip to help pass a subsequent less aggressive policy to target those loopholes...Let me rephrase that for you.....It's likely never gonna pass, and is more of an fake election promise that may, at best, one day translate in a completely defanged policy that will make absolutely no real impact on the status quo.

What if for a few seconds, somebody sells a sextillionth of a bitcoin for a dollar, and there are no other transactions? So the market value of my fraction of a bitcoin becomes more than a hundred million dollars, I owe millions in taxes, and then the value crashes and I have no way to pay?..I realize that’s a pretty contrived example that couldn’t really happen, but similar things could happen to real people with real assets that inflate and then deflate in value.
1
But unless you’re realizing the gains, you’ve not “made” any money. I find this problematic even though I’m sadly not a multi millionaire. ..What happens if the unrealized gains you get taxed on at one point end up being loses for whatever reason further down the line?
