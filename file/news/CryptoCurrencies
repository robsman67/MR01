That sounds like a great initiative! A focused space for discussing BTC DeFi projects and sharing insights without the noise of spam or ads is exactly what the community needs. I’m sure many will find value in joining.

Title: Politics is 'cryptonite'. With CEXs help.
8
Another example of politics interfering with people's access to financial tools and communication platforms. It's frustrating to see governments use their power to block platforms like Binance and X, especially when they are crucial for citizens dealing with economic instability. Glad to hear funds are SAFU, but these actions set a worrying precedent.
2
This is why I prefer trading on DEX, and with ZetaChain's interoperability solution one can now swap from any chain to any chain including legacy chains like Bitcoin.. Too many manipulations associated with CEXs.
1
It's disgusting. Probably all part of their One World Agenda and so they're testing compliance ab initio. When all's said and done, politicians the world over are in bed together. 
2
It's very worrisome to know that whatever tension there be between countries or geopolitical regions, it is all a sham to deceive the average citizen, because under the surface are politicians conniving to suffocate the peoples access to good and affordable tools to be financially independent.

Title: Crypto and democrats/republicans
19
Forget biden/harris/trump/vance they dont care at all and will just say what people want to hear.
15
Anyone that votes for a single issue doesn’t deserve a vote, especially if it’s simply about greed.
16
trUmp was anti crypto as president
13
Because people are suckers.  Trump knows this so he’ll say anything to get the suckers attention. He never fulfills his promises.
3
He's the bankruptcy king. ..Everything will hit an ATH when they toast the FED for the insurance money...Just don't buy or sell insurance (or petrodollars) and you'll be fine.
3
Biden’s policies have been anti-crypto. Elizabeth Warren claimed to build an “anti-crypto army”...Meanwhile Trump has embraced crypto and is going to the Bitcoin conference in Nashville soon.
3
Because the democrats like Elizabeth Warren have come out against Crypto.  Well, other than CBDC's.  Trump on the other hand has stated he supports it and wants to grow it...Kinda simple comparison.
2
[supprimé]
1
Biden actually vetoed a bill that would allow traditional banks to custody crypto in their own accounts. However, it appears that Harris is more open and lenient to the crypto industry.
1
Market performance does not mean shit in crypto or stocks. The government can prop up the stock market, but it doesn't mean the economy is doing well. And crypto is on a 4 year cycle and will go on its run no matter who is president...Market performance is not why people are saying this. Let me be straight up and say that crypto in itself is a libertarian concept and libertarian in its values. Satoshi was a heavy libertarian. ..For those of you that don't understand basic politics, libertarian means being liberal on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues. ..What this means is that fundamentally, democrats are the farthest away from being pro-crypto. Because as of now, crypto is really only a fiscal issue to the government. We have even seen plenty of actions from democratic politicians that are anti-crypto like Elizabeth Warren...And this is why Republicans would be fundamentally more pro-crypto as they are conservative on fiscal issues (obviously). And they've started to lean into it too. ..Crypto was never supposed to be tied to a specific political party, but it just happens to currently coincide with Republican fundamentals because its a fiscal issue. ..And don't be an idiot and talk about Trump. Regardless of anything he has said in the past, he has never tried to pass any legislature against crypto. Biden has. ..And remember the worst fucking piece of shit in the crypto space SBF? That dude was a huge liberal and he was terrible for this space and ripped money off. And as far as I know, he was the only major liberal actor in this space. All the exchange owners and big voices are libertarian and probably vote Republican...This is not me trying to push you to vote Republican. But if you are going to look at crypto from a political point of view, you'd be a fucking moron to think that Democrats are better for crypto than Republicans. Its literally a fiscally conservative issue. Unless you want heavy regulations, heavy taxation, CBDCs, paired with heavy government oversight. ..Not that it matters, but I've been around since 2013 and have seen people in crypto groups say some dumb ass shit about how they think Democrats are better for crypto just because they really don't even know about crypto.

1
Trump said he wants America to be the center of the crypto industry. He wants to start a bitcoin reserve for the United States. He also said he would never allow the central bank digital currency to happen. Not sure how you could be more pro crypto than that.
1
Nah trump literally said he doesn’t want other countries to take over and be  the main country for the crypto industry. He wants to establish a bitcoin reserve for the United States. Biden wants a central bank digital currency. You can’t be any more pro crypto than trump is at this point.
-1
trump says a lot of shit, does he follow up on it? normally not
6
Trump also said he would never allow a central bank digital currency.

So do the Democrats.  In this case they've made it clear they hate crypto because their wall street masters say so.  They want a CBDC.  ..And they can't stop lying when the truth would do fine.

Everyone who suggested you keep it all in ETH are probably right but i will probably say for the sake of diversification you invest about 4 ETH into alts, some of my best gems will be projects in AI ecosystem like RNDR,NAI and TAO.

I will keep 50% of it in ETH and the rest will be distributed as follows; 20% in SOL (one of the best movers in a bull market), 20% in INJ, and 10% in ASI (A token form by the OCEAN, FET, and AGIX merging and toping the AI trend).

I’m all for busting fraudsters! ..You seem to have done a lot of research into these folks, and have a lot of information you haven’t exactly presented it well - this looks like a wall of text, and a lot of folks won’t stop to read it. Take a look at Bellingcat and how they present investigations...Have you considered contacting the press (or someone in OSINT)?
2
You have to be pretty stupid and naive to fall for any pig butchering scam...A fool and his money etc

If they won’t stop to read it, then their opinion is not valid. ..It’s not exactly a sexy bit of information to present, particular in the limitations Reddit has.

Title: Is MT Gox responsible for the current BTC dip?

No.  They are returning btc to owners.  ..The owners of btc are choosing to sell.  Owners of btc are investors.  They are looking at the current pricing and are saying that given the price that they purchased at and the current price, that they would prefer their fiat money over btc.
5
It’s unregulated markets and Germany selling for funding war..Americans selling so that if they loose elections they don’t miss there share of lobbied money ..Plus market is unregulated with no base values
2
Btc is still up 85% in one year...Just taking profits after new ath and months of sideways trading.

I agree but don't you think most trader panic before the distribution and that was why we witnessed that dip. If this was responsible then we shouldn't be witnessing this retracement
0
If you don’t need the money, why sell?  Btc is very volatile.  Lots of ups and downs.  Personally, I’d hold and see where the train leads to.  I’m not buying now personally, but we’ll see if that was a good idea or not.

I don't care about anything but monero anymore.

Algorand. It is a joy to use, fast finality and simple and it seems that it is one of the few blockchains that ticks all the boxes to be potentially used for a CBDC. At least ECB seems to be looking into it.
22
Cardano.  Its built to last and very secure, someone tried to attack it recently, they had minimal impact and lost their funds...You can participate in staking without ever locking or having your funds slashed, and you get paid directly in ADA not some hokey derivatives...Its also one of the few where you get to decide how it develops over time.

I still believe that LINK doesn't get the attention they deserve. After all these years on the market, being probably the best oracle we had so far. ASI is heavily undervalued and imo people are not talking nearly enough about it. it's not everyday thing to see there giant projects in one niche merging their tokens and forces together in order to create something massive. i know that some people think that AI hype is diluted but that is a nonsense. soon it will be clear for everyone. i deeply believe that ASI is a chance we should not miss.

It is always about narratives and actual utility for me. Cartesi, as one of the leaders in the trending modularity thesis, is interesting.

Polyswarm. Insanely undervalued. One of the best uses for crypto I have seen. It is like VirusTotal but the engines are automatically paid for their accurate threat assessments (there is a complex system to determine accuracy). It is a superior model to not having any financial incentives; it means that specialists in particular areas can design engines and make money. Combining all of those niche engines provides way better coverage. They have clients like ebay and verizon.

It is ecological fast and feeless on chain.

What do you mean by value proposition? Nano doesn’t have institutional client I personally don’t know about any. It had similair problem like BTC at start when mtgox got hacked and Bitcoin was stolen. In nanos case someone hacked exchange bitgrail and nano was stolen it had impact on price but fundamentals of nanos code got better from info I read from devs.

Nano is still developed and working exactly as advertised. If you base projects value on price that is imho not good indicator.

In a shocking turn of events that has the crypto world buzzing, FTX users are set to receive 112% of their funds back, plus an unexpected bonus of billions more "left over." Yes, you read that right – not only will you get your money back, but you'll also get a little something extra. It's like finding a twenty-dollar bill in your old jeans, except this time it's a billion-dollar windfall...The Bankman-Fried family has come forward, emphatically declaring the trial was unfair, and Sam did NOT lose any user funds. Apparently, those billions were just misplaced in the crypto couch cushions and have now been found. Who knew running a multi-billion dollar exchange was just like losing your keys?..FTX users are celebrating, some even planning vacations with their newfound wealth. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is reportedly planning a grand reopening of FTX, complete with a "Finders Keepers" marketing campaign and a lifetime supply of anti-slip couch covers...Stay tuned as the saga continues. Who knows what other treasures might be discovered in the world of crypto?

13
As many people said and were down voted by the etf-hypesters: etf's are not good for crypto.
6
Hedge fuks got their corrupt hands in everything!!
2
Isn't it just because way too many individuals hold way too much Bitcoin and they are selling it off to cash in and buy their lambos? Historically, there's always been a period of relative calm for like 9 to 12 months after the Halving. People are taking profits and this is good for Bitcoin, because it reduces the number of large holders. It just takes time for Bitcoin to spread across the world. We need whales to sell off, take profit, and keep the price stable for extended periods of time. This is the only way the masses will be able to step in. ..All the analysts with their predictions for $250k, $500k, $1million are just pushing their agenda. They know that Bitcoin won't get much past 120k in the next cycle, because they can do math. They're just trying their hardest to create hype and FOMO for the regular folk, just like how Elon Musk has been doing it with his Mars-mission predictions. Keep the public happy and interested.

Title: What will the BTC inflation rate be vs USD after halving?
12
You are confusing two very different things. By inflation rate of Bitcoin we mean the inflation of Bitcoins supply and after the halving this inflation will be 0.84% per year. This means that after the halving there will be 0.84% more Bitcoins on the market in a years time.  .When we say USD inflation we don't mean the inflation of the monetary base but the increase of consumer prices of goods and services. In normal times developed countries target an inflation rate of 2%. It is a bit higher now but you can expect the dollar to lose 2% of its purchasing power per year in times of normal inflation.  .The increase of the SUPPLY of USD is not constant like it is in BTC.
3
You’re confusing inflation with “CPI”.  The government tries to get CPI to be 2%, but usually fails. CPI doesn’t accurately measure actual costs or prices in the economy. It doesn’t consider housing costs enough, nor the prices of equities, nor wages, and the government has changed their definition of  “CPI” over the years to make inflation look lower.  So literal inflation is probably double the government’s “CPI” number. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dilution/inflation is <1%: a LOT lower than true inflation in dollars.
1
Im not confusing anything. Inflation is the rise in prices of goods and services caused by monetary expansion, by definition. ..You want your inflation to be slightly above your GDP growth so your money doesnt become more valuable in time as that leads to hoarding money...Thats exactly why gold is a good backing of the currencies of developed economies, because the supply of gold inflates at about roughly 1.75% per year and thats roughly how much developed economies grow in normal times...CPI is just a way to measure inflation.

Title: What is the real cost of using Binance Convert to swap crypto? Binance say this Convert tool has no fees, but obviously Binance make their money by giving you a slightly worse price
6
I stopped using Binance ever since they had issues with PaySafe and switched to Tap Fintech. The platform ensures that I can effectively manage my assets without incurring excessive fees or losing value during conversions.
2
I suggest you look into low market cap coins to give you a better chance at better gains. Also, if you are only putting a couple hundred dollars or less, a big chunk is going to go in transactions fees if you invest in BTC or ETH and that wouldn't be fair to you. I highly suggest you do you research and invest in projects you believe in and don't follow the hype or chase anything that is pumping because then you become exit liquidity. Best of luck to you and I hope for many gains this bull season!
1
Would you know the fees for exchanging one crypto for another on Tap?..On Binance, the fee is 0.075% when you use the trading tool (if you pay the fees with the BNB coin, otherwise it is slightly higher at 0.1%).
1
With Tap Titanium, it's free. However, you can check their website for other plans. This is the plan I've been using.
1
I doubt that the conversion of crypto on Tap would be free. These exchanges make money through charging conversion fees. If it appears to be free, then there may be hidden fees, levied by slightly raising the price of the crypto you buy.

Title: Achieving Equilibrium Between Blockchain Security and Decentralization
46
[supprimé]
1
These are really good points. In a totally decentralized industry security relies on trust way too much. No matter how many precautions the developers take, if there is a hole in the contracts someone will find it eventually and probably exploit it. In a centralized system, all of this can be prevented.
1
I heard Hashgraph has more security than blockchain. Is this true.
1
I agree and Trevor Traina is spot on with this piece tbh. You want a healthy balance and not the extremes. Decentralization should be a choice. Especially because most users don’t even care what they are using, they just care about the product.

I also think we are headed in a direction where we will have a healthy mix of both. If we want a smoother and more secure user experience we will need to find a balance.

Utility < hype..That's my guess anyway. I think most of the real money in crypto isn't "for the tech" so they just don't care.

Nano is fine and has a good ecosystem.  .  .In 2017, when it was extremely popular, it was only listed on two small exhanges. One of the two turned out to be fraudulent and many people lost their money.  Since then, Nano has been listed on exchanges as Binance and Kraken.  .Another issue was the spam attacks. In 2021, the network received millions of spam transactions per day. This caused some nodes to become overloaded and fail. Nowadays Nano still has feeless transactions but has implemented anti-spam measures.
3
Nano is hard money. Zero Inflation + Zero Fees = you won't be leeched by Parasites + Network doesn't get Centralized into a Oligopoly then Monopoly of Miners and Stakers...Inflation is arguably the BIGGEST SCAM in the world, and yet 95%+ of the population is still victim to it. Nano makes robbing people's money via Debasement impossible, hence why the status quo fucking hates Nano, as they need Inflation and Fees to keep milking the sheep out of their economic energy...On top of that, transactions are confirmed fast as fuck, being 1000x more energy efficient than PoW chains...Nano = best digital money, for you, your neighbor and the planet. Simple really...Haters will say whatever they want, but when it comes to it, Nano is exactly what it claims to be.
6
because the nano foundation ran out of money, so they cannot pay people to shill the project like every other project does

Crypto offers solutions to non-problems.  .While the decentralized economy sounds great and all its no like people are currently using nano to order a pizza or buy clothes.  .All projects are just ideas of what could be but none has real impact in the word, until they do basically are coins = shitcoins.  .Hype, brandname and publicity its all that matters until shit actually starts seeing some real world use.

It’s expensive because it’s by far the most popular. L2s are the way when it comes to everyday transactions. Highly doubt anything will flip ETH unless something catastrophic happens.

38
Today’s top will be tomorrow’s half way point to the next top.
13
Forgive me if you already know all this and I am not advising to buy or not, but bitcoin is set to halve in April:  From chatgpt - The Bitcoin halving is a significant event that occurs approximately every four years (or after 210,000 blocks have been mined), and the next halving is indeed scheduled for April 19, 2024. This event has historically been a catalyst for price movements and market sentiment, making it a focal point for investors and traders alike. Here's an overview of what the halving entails and its potential implications for the market:..### What is Bitcoin Halving?..Bitcoin halving refers to the reduction of the block reward given to Bitcoin miners by half. When Bitcoin was created, the block reward was set at 50 BTC. This reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The process was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's anonymous creator, to mimic the gold mining process — becoming harder and less rewarding with time. This mechanism also serves as a deflationary counter to inflationary tendencies in traditional fiat currencies, by capping the total supply of Bitcoin at 21 million coins...### Implications of the Halving:..**1. Reduced Supply:** The immediate effect of the halving is a reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are created and hence, a slower growth in the overall supply. This can have deflationary effects on its value...**2. Miner's Revenue:** Initially, miners might see their revenue decrease, as the reward for mining new blocks is halved. However, if the price of Bitcoin increases, it can offset the reduced block reward...**3. Historical Price Movements:** Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price increases in the months following a halving. For instance, after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin saw a substantial bull run in 2017, and similarly, after the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin's price surged to then all-time highs in late 2020 and early 2021. It's important to note, however, that past performance is not indicative of future results, and many other factors can influence Bitcoin's price...**4. Market Sentiment:** The halving often leads to increased media attention and public interest in Bitcoin, potentially attracting new investors to the market. This speculative demand can drive the price up in anticipation of the halving event...### Should You Buy Before the Halving?..The anticipation of reduced new supply and potential for price increases can make buying Bitcoin before a halving event seem attractive. However, several factors should be considered:..* **Market Anticipation:** Often, the market anticipates the halving well in advance, and this expectation can be priced into Bitcoin's value before the event occurs..* **Volatility:** Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are known for their volatility. Prices can fluctuate widely based on a range of factors beyond the halving..* **Risk Tolerance:** Your decision to buy should align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Cryptocurrency investments can be risky, and it's essential to be prepared for the possibility of loss...### Conclusion..While the halving is a significant event with the potential to impact Bitcoin's price positively, investing based on the halving alone is speculative. It's crucial to do thorough research, consider the broader economic and market context, and think about how this investment fits into your overall portfolio and risk tolerance. As with any investment, diversification and a clear understanding of your investment goals and risk tolerance are key.
5
Timing the market is usually a fools game but even buying in at these high prices will pay off. This bull run has barely begun.

If you haven’t been buying over the last year + I don’t think right now is the time to start. Wait till all you see is red.

I put a few k into bitcoin few weeks ago and wished I did previously when at lows but wasn’t at financial state I’m in now.  Very happy I’m over 25% gain in just few weeks.  People talking about sky’s the limit with this, I’m reluctant but need to be along for ride regardless.
3
DCA is one of the effective strategy to buy. You’ll always win in the long run.
3
Buying at a recent high can actually be a good idea. Look at NVDA recently, it had tops over and over for the past 1.5 years, and every time surpassed the previous high. Now it's up 10x or something since the most recent major bottom in late '22. Trees can grow to the sky. The worst position is 0 BTC, at least buy $100. Then learn more and maybe DCA. I still regret selling any BTC I've ever had every time it pumps like this. I'm so sad I can't get more than 1 now.
2
I would not enter any market at a top...If you have already been buying for 2 years on a schedule as us DCAers do -- sure keep it up...But this is a terrible point in time for a mass buy in. Or, maybe it is a great time. However there is a lot of up and or downside
5
I'd be leaving funds parked out in fiat, ready to pounce when the inevitable crash comes
2
Eth is not nearing its ATH. It hit $5k back in 2021, right now its trying to break through $3500. ..&#x200B;..BTC is near ATH. I think ETH will follow  that and get to its previous high as well.
2
It doesn’t matter when you start if you recurring DCA buy. You’ll always win in the long run.
2
You missed the train already I'm afraid ..Just wait til it dips again to buy more or hold on to what you already have
1
I'm feeling the fomo but I'm out of money so no buying for me

I'm not alone when I think we might see a 100k BTC by 2025. In that case it's not too late.

I like to buy high sell low

Lmao not this shit again

Never buy in the green. Becareful jumping into crypto with a fear of missing out

I prefer to DCA at different intervals at this stage. Since I have some BTC, I'll turn my attention to promising low market cap utility tokens like DUA, NXRA, and DIMO for my portfolio.

This is what I thought when I first got into crypto, but now I know that getting on a moving train is a gamble not in your favour

Funny thing is that when newbies like you come in, dump money into market and start saying BTC to 250k, that’s when we should be selling.  If your grandma or uncle Jedidiah ask about BTC or ETH, time to sell.  But things are different this time around with the ETFs.
1
Soooooo, “No, Yes, Maybe”. Great comment.
2
I thought it was a bull run? I'm so confused
2
yeah eth is quite a bit off, but i'm sure we'll see some insane eth ralley days as it follows BTC
2
Yeah ETH has a lot of headroom to gain as do other older coins like BCH whose last realistic ATH was just about 1.2k, it's pumped 45% in the last 24 hours but still has a long way to go.
1
I think your answer is the best one...I may be a dumb IT engineer but my group of friends are a combination of fintech leaders and coinbase lawyers and they're all moving into ETH now.

Watch the noob groups. When the questions switch from "what kind of wallet should I buy" to "what shitcoin do I flip?" Thats when you start to cash out.
1
Your best bet isn’t bitcoin, it’s probably a mix between eth, solana, cardano, chainlink. You’ll maybe 3-4x your investment instead of 2x.

I've seen many proclaimed bullruns come crashing down, it can go any which way
-1
We’re in a unique situation where prices are going up simply to keep up with the dollar losing value due to inflation . On top of that, tech was wrecked for 2021-2022 after the pandemic rally. So what looks like massive growth right now is actually just recovery. Granted, NVDA and a few other will potentially come back to earth a bit, but the market on the whole is on the rise, especially when you consider that internationally you’ve only got two good options to store your cash right now, US stocks, or btc.
1
never listen to this narrative or else you will be buying tops..... Look at your chart BTC is overbought on all time frame just like the stock market. Price go up and down you just need to remain patience

Well. Diversify. Some in the bank,.Some in btc, eth, Ada, maybe some in outlandish alt coins just to gamble. And definitely bury a solid portion pirate style on a deserted island in a chest after converting the bulk of your net worth into gold coins…but hey that’s just what I’d do.
2
Yes. Cold wallets are the safest...Hot wallets are the most vulnerable wallets in the world. All of the digital wallets *store your security keys and codes in their online servers*, which are extremely vulnerable to hacker attacks, scamming attempts and other ill intent-driven actions...[https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/cold-wallet#why-cold-wallets-are-superior-to-hot-ones](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/cold-wallet#why-cold-wallets-are-superior-to-hot-ones)
2
I believe it's safe to hold your assets in cold wallets. Personally, I prefer holding my assets in the Brillion. They have integrated the Account Abstraction standard into their smart wallet, with a focus on self-custody, SSI, privacy, banking integration, and remittance payments.
2
ok all these answers are WRONG!!! Dude think about it...and dont get me wrong...Im not saying cold wallets arent safe. im saying if you want to save and accumulate value in that savings, DO NOT have the basis of the currency be crypto...&#x200B;..Think about this...When you go to PAY for your education abroad, they arent going to accept a crypto payment. they want money, dollars...If you save a dollar today, there is a MASSIVE chance that it will still be worth a dollar 10 years from now...&#x200B;..If you save a dollar of an altcoin or bitcoin today, that $1 value you started with may not be the same 10 years from now. it COULD be more, it COULD be less. this is the basis of understanding that crypto is volatile. You cant "bank" on its value an hour from now...&#x200B;..If you dont trust the banks, then dont put your money in the bank. Invest your dollars in something else...Open an IRA (not a ROTH ira because you want to be able to take it out)..Open a growth fund with an investment company if you have x amount of dollars to save each month. Just send it to them...Get yourself a financial planner and have a discussion with them every 3 months. Have them move your money from point a to point b as per their experience...&#x200B;..You can have this side money sent to them from your GROSS income (Them being the IRA, Growth fund, investment company, or financial planner) This way over the next years, you are taxed on less income...&#x200B;..Will there be taxes (penalties) to pay when you take the $ out for your education? Sure, but itll be less than what you COULD lose if you put it in crypto as a savings. And for your mental health itll be less stressful then putting it into a bank...&#x200B;..So over the years, what do you put in a bank? The exact amount of money that you need to pay your bills.
1
i found a map. you got a shovel?  i think with your thinking and my plane, we might have an opportunity.

1
Saving money in hot wallets?
1
Saving money in cold wallets. ..In addition, I bought some bitcoin and was greatly surprised at networks fees, that’s total rip-off! So, I assume it is actually not the best idea to keep my savings in cryptocurrencies but only invest in them and keep them in the long run to get profits. If I want to withdraw my money eventually, it’s better to come up with another idea because it’s always a risk to lose your money.
1
If you just save your crypto and not use it, definitely use cold wallet, instead of hot. ..Pros: it is safer. You always have it with you. It is stored in a hardware device...Cons: it costs around $100 and it offers a limited variety of cryptocurrencies.

I gotta be honest, this is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. “Rather than owning a work of art or a house, investors can own fractions of it.” Imagine someone saying: “I own 0.003% of the Mona Lisa. Well - not the *actual* Mona Lisa, the digital version.”
1
Some projects tried this and it got shut down by the SEC.  Saw this with the NFT share of real estate and the idea was that nft holders will get a monthly cash flow from the real estate.
1
I am not touching real stuff anymore, all in on digital.

lmao, nothing. They just want distance between the bad rep NFT's have gotten so it's a rebrand. .    .It won't work.
11
Rwa example is opuls chek them out
1
Tokenization of a bond has far more uses than tokenization of a picture.
1
A real world asset can be represented by an NFT, but an NFT doesn't have to relate to a real world asset.  An example of an RWA is a digital event ticket.  It can now be an NFT that is tradable and can have perks and rewards attached to it...An example of an NFT that is not associated with RWA would be a membership to a club or organization.  Ownership of the NFT acts as access to the club and can provide various benefits.
1
NFT is a broad term just meaning it’s a 1 of 1, unique tokens that’s non-fungible. RWA are tokenized representations of ownership of physical assets like commodities for example. These tokens could theoretically be traded on decentralized exchanges and open the doors to peer to peer trading of real world assets in a trust-less way. It a revolutionary idea that’s yet so see large scale implementation.
1
NFT is a non-fungible token, a wording they used to say a digital 1-1. Digital medium can be copied easily though...RWA are going to be real, physical assets. You can't copy a real physical asset...This is the original way that NFT's were being used prior to their weird craze where they wanted to switch it's use to something that can be digitally copied...RWA is more like old school NFT's. NFT's were in the very very beginning used mostly for online art, it was a way to codify in a ledger "I made this painting/digital art/digital whatever, and this is my license of proof"...Why it went from that to "This is a special license that shows I have this and that no one else can have it and we'll put this on a mass scale blockchain" is totally off track for what the original purpose was of NFT's...What they are saying above with RWA is that ledgers that contain what a company owns or an individual owns can be more safely stored securely and efficiently by way of a blockchain. This will allow hashing and proof of ownership of real world assets - think books or songs or art or houses or cars or accounts or medical history, etc. etc...Blockchain is by far the most secure way we know of right now to log all of this and have it be able to integrate with other blockchains. This has been taking forever to finally fructify due to regulations and banks etc. but it looks like that's what they are referring to; not some NFT 2.0 idea.../rant (I'm fully against NFT's! I was using them prior to the weird NFT craze and they were not even sort of being thought of as what they are now, so maybe this is going to do the same, idk.)

Title: Shower Thoughts on Monero's Future
33
So far the darkweb is the only way a coin has grown from obscurity to mainstream explosion. ..All the success in crypto stems from that and now the market has decided Monero is the coin that should be used...Let’s see what happens because as far as I know the government has no intention of stopping the darkweb. (They invented a lot of the tech)
16
Yeah man this 100% if we go back to the old internet stock analogy; when the World Wide Web became popular hundreds of companies started using it trying to solve problems that didn’t even really exist and they were v popular at the time but died off quite quickly. ..Monero is one of the few that has a real use case I was on Archetype market(for research purposes ofc) last night and the current user count stands at over 360,000 that huge. It’s only growing aswell...Very cool open source technology aswell. The whitepaper is also written by a mysterious unknown individual going by a pseudonym...Regardless of your opinions of other cryptos it’s safe to say that monero is here to stay
11
 this take on monero's future clicks while other cryptos chase tech, monero's privacy focus is key. tighter rules might spike demand for truly anonymous coins like monero. in a privacy starved world monero could be the go to for financial freedom
3
It's all bullshit yes. Protocols don't scale, there's no trilemma. And definitely Monero is garbage because it facilitates crime x100 times more than Fiat...Its casino. It will all go down one day. Until then it's game on!!
1
XMR made us our riches like 8 or 9 years ago.

The best part is that they can't force people do need KYC to obtain Monero P2P.

Whenever you think that some transparent ledger is the future, ask yourself the following question...Why would future corporations and big companies use a completely transparent wallet adress , where all their transactions and amounts can be tracked by anyone on the blockchain for eternity?
1
There are a lot of "what ifs" in your post and not much to back them up. DeFi and Smart Contracts allow software devs to replicate functionality that was previously restricted to banks and government entities, functionality that required placing blind trust in a giant obscure entity, and the only thing that keeps those entities honest right now is fear of government scrutiny (and it's debatable how honest they really are behind closed doors, there are numerous stories of banks gaming the system with shady practices, search Youtube for some videos on HSBC, for example)...There is definitely a use case for global exchange system that can't be tampered with by corporations or government entities. It's no different than internet protocols that were developed in the 80s. The reason you can open a website from another country is because of their consistency. We don't have that consistency right now between the banking systems, which is why Western Union can charge 10%+ fees, why your money can get locked up by the bank or by another country that doesn't like your country for something that has nothing to do with you...Our current financial system is held together by duct tape, in fact if you were to buy a house in the US, or enforce a legal agreement when the other party refuses to honor it, you'll quickly discover that our legal system as well as property records are also held together by duct tape. Buying a house requires paying a couple thousand dollars for title insurance. The title insurance involves a guy going on the computer and doing a "background check" on the property going back to as far as the paper records allow. If you resell the same property again , the buyer pays that fee again even though they can literally reuse the same report. The reason for the cost (and the word "insurance" in the name) is because there is always a slight chance the guy doing the research f\*cked up and missed something or some record from 200 years ago got lost. You're basically reimbursing the title company for their own f\*ck ups in the event they get sued and need to pay compensation. If property records instead existed on the blockchain, you could pull them yourself in 5 minutes for a couple bucks in transaction fees...Anonymity is a legitimate use case, but DeFi ultimately has a much bigger market once companies plug existing systems into it. DeFi is not a fad, it's a set of transaction protocols that currently doesn't see much use yet. I'm sure back in the 80s internet was seen the same way, and having a website seemed speculative and gimmicky as well.
1
already is
1
Meh, DeFi has had soo many rugpulls and liquidity is lacking. Good that people are developing it for the inevitable future when CEXes are useless government honeytraps. But DeFi is not competition for cryptocurrencies, it's made for trading whatever coin you want without using a CEX. ..Of course there are what-ifs, Bitcoin is a giant experiment that has only been running for about 15 years!

that's a very stupid comparison because paypal's estimated annual energy use also includes running datacenters, office buildings, and call centers...obviously paypal's going to use more energy than ethereum, they also make enough money to pay the bills...With blockchain, the big hurdle is making enough money to pay the bills. You need a technology solution that is more financially viable than not using the blockchain, because every single blockchain solution, will have an energy debt. Your nodes need to be profitable and also fill a niche not currently solvable without the blockchain, and that's incredibly hard.

>paypal's annual energy use also includes running datacenters, office buildings, and call centers...Ethereum can do what paypal does and much much more, without having to need data centers, office building, and call centers.

It's pretty standard. They take a chunk on the way in and and the way out.

Do you use any other exchange ? .Send it to an exchange that converts crypto for free. If you are outside of New York use crypto dot com..I buy crypto using binance and send it to crypto dot com. I transfer crypto to pounds and with draw my money to the bank . The only charge would be the blockchain fee and the withdraw fee.
1
I know it might be hard but your fees will be A LOT LESS if you p2p.
1
You can try selling it in smaller amount. If you sell $100 at a time you may only pay a 1% fee instead of 5%. Just do that ten times. This isn't always the case but it works on crypto.com with most coins.

spread on binance p2p sucks for crypto, pass it to usdt and then use the usdt to sell it on the p2p

$100k is no chump change to ***invest***. I'd do my homework into the coin's fundamentals. A few that come to mind:..1. Is the coin a layer 1 or 2 coin? If L2 coin, what L1 is it on?.2. For L1 coins:.   1. What's the acc't model? utxo like btc or global acc't like eth?.   2. Does it have a fixed supply? 21million btc or sky's the limit like fiat.   3. Development philosophy? go fast and break things or slow n steady research based.   4. Development style and language - safe, high assurance using functional languages such as Haskell or everyday, more popular languages?.   5. Initial coin distribution (ICO) - fair with majority going to the public or majority being held privately by devs, VCs...   6. Transactions.      1. speed / chain tps.      2. cost.   7. Chain reliability - does it go down?.   8. Anonymity.   9. PoW or PoS.   10. Smart contracts.   11. Liquid staking.   12. Governance.   13. and a whole lot more that others can add..

They can’t ban people from using it it’s a decentralised computer program but removing it from exchanges will likely only make it more valuable in the long run. ..It’s a digital cash that solves one of the problems outlined by satoshi in the btc white paper..It was created by someone under a pseudonym aswell nobody knows who made it and the way the whitepaper is written is in a similar style and structure to the btc whitepaper

Bitcoin is not a utilitarian crypto. It is money, plain and simple. It's decentralized, borderless, weightless, deflationary. It will eventually become to global reserve currency. Governments, international corporations and all large scale transactions will be made in Bitcoin...Example. Russia and China want to fuck over the USA right? Well they trade commodities very often on a major scale. Normally they have no choice but to settle in USD because Russia does not want yuan and China does not want rubles. They both ultimately would like something stable that has actual value like gold. But with gold you have to ship it, insure it, store it, secure it etc. Eventually they will realize and cave, and start trading in BTC.  You can make a billion dollar transaction if you want with no middleman and for very little fees or added costs. ..Bitcoin is absolutely unstoppable.  If the government tries to accuse you of something and wants to seize your assets, and want your Bitcoin, they can't get them. "I hit my head and forgot my seed phrase" they can never force it out of you. ..If you really want to use BTC as currency, the lightning network is great.  Extremely low fees, extremely fast and can instantly be converted to whatever local currency the recipient wants. If you want to buy an orange from a fruit stand in Colombia you can send BTC and the fruit stand owner can receive pesos. ..It's perfect, and I have a weird feeling that a time traveler from the future brought it to us to save us from ourselves.
6
They are stout networks, especially Ethereum. But they are centralized besides monero. Monero is good for money laundering and tax evasion so I think it's a good network. But you're missing the point. Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized, deflationary money. ..I'm not saying that those coins are bad investments, but I'm not really interested in making $usd profits off of crypto. My only goal is to accumulate Bitcoin.

Title: Is there any L1 blockchain industry-specific out there?
3
Not sure what you mean by industry specific...Radix designed their network with institutional applications, devX and user security in mind...It takes only a few weeks to learn the language. Since assets are native resources common smart contract exploits don’t work. Native account abstraction will makes account management simple and secure for institutions...Users don’t have to worry about clicking a wrong link or a frontend hack because the transaction manifest always shows the guaranteed outcome of a transaction before signing.
3
I suggest checking out Peaq Network, a Layer 1 multi-chain blockchain purposely built for DeFi and Machine RWAs. There are already 20+ DeFi projects from 6 different industries building on Peaq.
1
Fir example: Industry specific such as Camino Network (L1 for the travel industry)..Radix I never heard of it but I will look into it..Maybe it could be seen as an institutional specific blockchain

Radix is not specific. You can basically build anything on it. ..It’s just so well designed that it makes sense for institutions as well...What exactly does Camino provide for the travel industry and why is it needed?

Sell eth to usdt and send through bep20 or trc20, very cheap and fast. Once your friend get the usdt, just buy back the same amount of eth.

#1 rule: not your keys, not your tokens. Live by these words no matter what

Invest what you can afford to loose.

Everything is a scam. Don't respond to DMs anywhere because those are absolutely scams. Don't join any Telegram or Discord or Whatsapp or whatever groups because those are scams...Don't invest any money unless you are ok with losing it all...You can't be too safe, use non SMS 2FA for everything...Watch Youtubers to learn the basics, but do not listen to any advice about which coins, price predictions l, etc, because last bull run showed that nobody knows what they are talking about at best and at worst they are out to scam you out of your money...That being said, https://danteachescrypto.com/ has some basic info and his rules are pretty sound. As far as exchanges, Kraken is great. Coinbase is ok. Understand there are different fees on exchanges and even different fees between Kraken and Kraken Pro for example.
5
1. Buy Bitcoin only..2. Use Coinbase..3. If you’re buying a significant amount, buy and learn how to use a hardware wallet from the likes of Trezor. ..Those are 3 solid tips that will help you avoid scams, theft and losing lots of money.
5
Start on cash app get you some bitcoin to play with
2
I started in 2017 with Coinbase. Just link to bank account and DCA. Gemini is also an ok exchange. If you want a good primer just look on YouTube for the CryptosRus and watch his videos on how to set up an initial portfolio. You want to divide your portfolio up into three parts. Bitcoin and Eth. Midcaps. And small caps. Depending on your risk tolerance, you dedicate a different percent to each of these. Usually a good idea to start with mostly bitcoin and some bigger mid caps until you get used to volatility. You’re unlikely to lose all your money this way. We are already in the bull market but things still have a long way to go. Probably for about 12-18 months. If you want low risk, just buy some of the top 20 coins by market cap. Go to coin gecko or coin market cap for tokens by rank. The top 20 coins are going to have smaller gains overall, but also less downside. They’re not gonna go to zero like the tokens further down the list.
2
I’m sure I’ll get hate for this but if you wanna dip your toes, buy on PayPal or Venmo. I bought both BTC and ETH via PP a couple years ago and just letting it ride. Yes they have fees but I don’t think outrageous.
1
Everything is a scam...Everyone is a scammer...There is no such thing as free money. ..Never click on any links...Never visit odd looking websites..Be very wary of any smart contracts...Stick to Btc and Eth. ..Stay in an exchange to start until you truely understand how things work. (They at least offer some level of protection)..Don't fomo...Do your own research...Crypto is still a high risk investment, so only invest what you van afford to lose...Be cautious. ..Be vigilant.  ..Approach everything as a scam...Assume everyone is a scammer.

There are a lot of advice out there but I believe that reputability of an Exchange counts for making it a choice for your crypto trading to avoid the likes of FTX saga among others..On the other hand a newbie could leverage on products like copy trading while gaining your grounds in the know-how of crypto trading studying elite traders...I'd advice one to go for Exchanges that has such features in store like Bitget, OKX & Binance but tbh I prioritize going for the former IMHO.

In short a large amount of the supply has been injected in to the market and it now stands at 80%. .Algo is a sleeping giant that has lots of upgrades either happening or upcoming. Dynamic Lambda have reduced the block time to sub 3 seconds on average, still with instant finality, with TPS of 7k-10k. .The consensus is being upgraded to a P2P gossip network with node running rewards. This can be done by anyone at home with low tech requirements and one click node technical guide provided by the foundation. .Python coding through AlgoKit 2.0, lowering the barrier to onboarding new Devs. No issues around complex coding in Teal with line by line debugging and AI assistance on chain. .RWA projects and tokenisation - The Bank of Italy has chosen Algorand to serve as its public blockchain platform. It is expected that a significant percentage of bank and insurance guarantees will leverage digital ledger technologies. .Quantoz Payments has obtained an EMI license from the Dutch Central Bank to issue EURD on the Algorand platform..I could go on but won’t..(Before I get any hate, I’m not an Algo Maxi, I have a very diverse portfolio including; BTC, Eth, ADA, Qnt, XRP,XLM,XDC,HBar… etal)

Why would you EVER sell at a loss? I bought SOL in 2021 and at one time lost 80% and it recovered, I sold and took a small profit.

If you like the features of clarity it was developed in collaboration with stacks. Which in my opinion has the best base mission around. Smart contracts for bitcoin.

One thing that may have dampened the mood was the MyAlgo wallet hack. Web-based wallet MyAlgo users found that their assets were being removed from their wallets starting in February 2023. The exploit remained unknown until April 2023, at which time it was revealed that malicious JavaScript code must have been injected on January 21st. The total losses have been estimated at $9.6m and investigation remains ongoing. I'm actually working on a large article about it at the moment:..[https://quadrigainitiative.com/cryptocurrencyhackscamfraudwiki/index.php?title=MyAlgo\_Web\_Wallet\_JavaScript\_CDN\_Exploit](https://quadrigainitiative.com/cryptocurrencyhackscamfraudwiki/index.php?title=MyAlgo_Web_Wallet_JavaScript_CDN_Exploit&veaction=edit)

"Why would you hold an asset you wouldnt buy today. Has been the best advice I ever got for investing...You sell at a loss because your profits are bigger woth the money you have now elsewhere.
8
Because if I cut my losses I can make it back, and then some, in a more promising project. I’m not convinced I need to sell right now though, I’d likely keep at least some in.
4
Because in markets, especially crypto, assets move together.  If you can take money from one asset that you are at a loss on, and put it in another asset that has a higher probability of higher potential gains, then you could make more money. You can also write off that loss on your taxes.

I'm not all in on Cardano but it is my biggest bag. Cardano is building a ecosystem foundation sideways first. Building a solid base. Then they will scale up. Most chains are trying to move to fast for first mover advantage. This process leaves alot of bugs in the ecosystem. Their philosophy is launch now and fix problems later. Cardano is moving slower and making sure everything is correct. They want organic growth that is perfect before they Launch anything. Also Cardano is the only blockchain that has never shut down or been hacked. It's to decentralized. DYOR

I understood everything except the intentional gibberish

I have a decent sized bag of Cardano. I have for a while. Just curious to hear your rationale. I agree with it, and will add that I appreciate the work they’re doing to onboard Africa on the blockchain - the societies that stand to benefit most from this tech are 3rd world countries where they actually need novel solutions to solve problems their government refuses to, specifically solutions that empower the individuals to take ownership of their community development considering their leaders are inept and insanely corrupt. For example, one of the biggest barriers to economic flow in Africa are the lack of something as basic as fucking roads. What happens when people can easily create DAOs to build roads themselves? Growth in Africa has a huge potential upside and I appreciate Cardano for having the long term vision to support this. Thanks for your impressions!

Buy the rumor sell the news has worked very well for me throughout the years. BTC going down after the ETF was approved was exactly what I expected. ..The buying pressure from ETF will take some time to manifest.

No one is questioning the 3 sleezy SEC caused issues of the bitcoin spot ETF .. ..(1) the forcing of USD instead of BTC settlements - overtly rediculous when Compared to spot gold ETF or other commodity … possibly just for SEC staff to get kickback off the added fees for those extra transactions by JP Morgan and Goldman Sacs .. ..(2)the SECs little $2 billion “ accidental hack ” of a fake jan 9 , 2024 approval vs the so called real jan 10, 2024 approval … ..(3) the rediculously hard to find 30+ page SEC spot bitcoin ETF approval document itself.. do you have copy ? ..(Did you see in that approval document that a couple of the spot ETF were verbally approved earlier in the week by Gary G.)..Looks like the USA govt and SEC may be  outlaws now and we the people do nothing. Sad.

Title: Having a hard time transferring my ETH that is on the BNB chain. Noobish in crypto, how do I make my ETH tradable? I'm assuming I did it incorrectly because I still have no BNB in my wallet
11
First of all: ignore ALL help that is offered to you in DMs. ..True help will NEVER be done in DMs
18
It's literally in bold red letters on the screen
21
You have ETH on your wallet address for Binance Smart Chain. Any type of action you make on that chain requires you to have some smart chain BNB on your wallet, because transaction fee will be deducted from your BNB amount...If you want to transfer and sell your ETH, go to ETH on your Binance wallet (or whatever exchange you are using), choose deposit ETH and make sure you choose Binance Smart Chain as the network you'll be using for transaction. Use the address the exchange provides you and send your ETH there...But first, as I explained, buy/transfer a few dollars worth of BNB to that wallet address using Binance Smart Chain network.
8
Bridge your ETH first.
3
Whichever chain you are on you always have to pay gas fee in that chain's native token...If you have ETH on Binance Smart Chain and you want to make any type of transaction you have to pay gas in BNB.If you have ETH on Ethereum network and you want to make any type of transaction you have to pay gas in ETH..And so on.....Note that you already must have native (to chain) token in your wallet to make any transaction.
3
DONT FUCKING SEND YOUR CRYPTO TO ANOTHER CHAIN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE DOING. THERE IS A HUGE CHANCE YOU ARE GOING TO BURN YOUR SHIT BRO
2
You are trying to go from Optimism to polygon?
1
Are you sure the ETH is on the BNB chain? It's not native to BNB.
1
Second of all: ignore ALL the wording in the bold red writing on your withdrawal page telling you what the issue is
4
I did that but it never arrived in my wallet - never dealt with eth outside of "just vanilla eth* blockchain...I think it'd a combo of my lack of knowledge and crypto.com wallet not supporting whatever network I need for transfer

CB has frozen my account for “my safety” two times. Both at the start of bull markets. Last time was end of 2020 when I was trying to buy crypto. The second time was this summer. My account was blocked from august until November. They said it was for my protection. I had to fill out a questionnaire and I proved that it was me, that I was experienced, and I simply used CB as an on and off ramp, as I have done since 2017! I hate CB they fucked me two times at critical moments in market cycles..Edit: even after re verifying and answering their questions they kept my account locked until November. They wouldn’t give me a reason why. And basically said tough shit. They did this while there was some money in the account which I couldn’t access until November so I was basically stuck holding whatever alt coins were in there at that time. I only ever really used them as an on and off ramp though because they are instant. I recently moved and I afraid to change my info on CB because I fear they will lock my account again for months when I do it. Customer since 2017 and they treat me like shit. Fuck CB. Literally anything else is better.
3
Never had a problem.
12
Tbh fees are high but CB is the only off ramp I trust. Move your coins to a cold storage asap soon as you buy it.
2
I locked my Etherium on Coinbase until 2.0 or whatever the next one is to get the 4% interest.  I have no idea if the platform is now ready.  I don't keep that well of track, but It's been so difficult with all my crypto in different apps, and it's so complicated that I do not think this will ever go mainstream.
2
Partly agree use metamask but in Australia you can only withdraw to fiat through cb and crypto.com. now due to regulations

If you convert to USDC and then pull out it’s much smoother

I'm with you man, I've lost all faith in Coinbase...For me the incident was when a bug in their Android mobile app dropped the XLM memo on chain, which caused me to lose hundreds of dollars. Even after recreating the issue with video evidence, explaining the exact steps to recreate, defining which apps it did and did not happen on, and mentioning how much money this had cost me, I never got more than seemingly autocomplete responses (annoyingly telling me the txn was successful...🙄) from their support, until ultimately my case was closed due to inactivity  after they had told me the issue had been escalated...Anyway, TLDR they do not care about your funds at all. The platform works until you need help, at which point...well good luck getting them to care how much money they've cost you.

When you need to confirm your ID, you need to make sure you are not holding your ID card in your hand. If any of the edges are blocked at all, they will reject the attempt...I've had this happen to me before and it is annoying as it slows down transactions. But if you place your ID on a table and have clear lighting and nothing is blocked, they will accept the ID authentication...I'm sure this was OP's problem. Though I doubt he'll admit it as he seems to be convinced Coinbase is against him.

You can avoid massive fees elsewhere and have control of your own crypto too.

I’ve literally only had problem with withdrawal times on Coinbase.  Never issues with Kraken or Gemini.

Off ramp is not part of my problem. My problem was with not being allowed to withdraw my crypto to a wallet until the market was more favorable for Coinbase, so they don't have to file for bankruptcy when the market takes a hit.
1
Btcmarkets also
2
Pull out to where?
2
The other half of my transaction was USDC, it says that in the post. I was not able to withdraw either SOL or USDC until I had to nag CB support twice over the course of 16 hours, and even then they told me multiple times that my crypto wasn't being sent because the network was clogged. Solana network clogged for 16 hours huh? Oh and then immediately after I asked to speak to a manager 16 hours later, when SOL was already moved by 10% up again, the transactions were sent immediately by the manager, took 2 seconds.
2
Scummy sounding site? Who doesn't know about Jupiter? You clearly aren't very familiar with crypto. If you are buying like $9 dollars worth of crypto, then yes, you'll save $.50. How about this, at the $6k dollar mark, you save about $160, per transaction. So if you are a day trader, like me, $160 per transaction is literally THOUSANDS monthly.

I bet you were not even born when CB was invented

It's not legal there.

Again, there are banks with money that would make Coinbase look like Safemoon that still had bank runs and  a lot of people got screwed out of their own money. But you think that couldn't happen to Coinbase because why? Not even to mention that in a bank, all of their assets depreciating by 20% in one day is much more difficult than at Coinbase where their assets can lose billions in seconds daily. But you don't think that can happen...Just the fact alone that you aren't comprehending that Coinbase is doing this to more than just 1 person at a time is really making your statement just hurt my head. There is a minor difference between $6k and a few hundred. Did you even read the post or no?

Wasn't staking, but that's another good point. They have many different measures to stop you from removing your money from CB.

Probably more of a SOL issue, which doesn't surprise me they have shut down that network multiple times for their own benefit and the consumers expense.

Coinbase has a market cap of $31B.  Do you really think they dont have $12K laying around to complete your transaction.  It sucks this happened to you.  You have every right to be annoyed because I would be as well , but lack of funding was not the issue here.
10
I have used both Kraken and Gemini and have accounts with both but they have even higher fees than CB.

oh actually...

No you're absolutely right, all I have ever used is coinbase and never went anywhere else because there was no need to and I was watching fools like you losing all their money trusting these scummy sounding sites. Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the US. Unless you're giving me another publicly traded company in the US, no thanks.

Not even to mention that in a bank, all of their assets depreciating by 20% in one day is much more difficult than at Coinbase where their assets can lose billions in seconds daily. But you don't think that can happen...Just the fact alone that you aren't comprehending that Coinbase is doing this to more than just 1 person at a time is really making your statement just hurt my head. There is a minor difference between $6k and a few hundred. Did you even read the post or no?

Wasn't staking, but that's another good point. They have many different measures to stop you from removing your money from CB.
2
Probably more of a SOL issue, which doesn't surprise me they have shut down that network multiple times for their own benefit and the consumers expense.

In the US CB disabled CB Pro..Are you referring to CB Advanced?

Great hack!  I’ve only been using cb pro for stop limit, but I should use it for all!

Wait, did they bring back CB Pro?!
5
No thanks, I'll stick to Jupiter at even cheaper than .2%

There pro account is paid and only effects the first 10,000..The fees are ridiculous..Anyone who trades volume will need to find another exchange ..Fuck the fees on coinbase fuck um
-1
>that's why I don't use CEX's anymore..Literally has a post about using coinbase.
25
That wasn't the problem, the problem was like I said, Coinbase wouldn't release it until the market went back up, I'll be happy to link the entire conversation with CB support
-1
I’m aware.

How u gonna onboard fiat tho and coins not available on dexs

Coinbase has a market cap of $31B.  Do you really think they dont have $12K laying around to complete your transaction.  It sucks this happened to you.  You have every right to be annoyed because I would be as well , but lack of funding was not the issue here.
9
I have used both Kraken and Gemini and have accounts with both but they have even higher fees than CB.
3
oh actually...
2
No you're absolutely right, all I have ever used is coinbase and never went anywhere else because there was no need to and I was watching fools like you losing all their money trusting these scummy sounding sites. Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the US. Unless you're giving me another publicly traded company in the US, no thanks.

I'm 34. So that means I was probably around before you were invented.

Okay. Thank you. When CBP dropped, I was wondering why I couldn't make an account, and no one knew . Customer support didn't give me an answer and just told me to keep trying.

ETH is included in that group of shitcoins. You literally said the “solana network was down” in the body of this post, yet the title is complaining about coinbase. Figure out what you’re mad about first, then post.
2
Yeah 10k / month
1
Nah sol has been my bread and butter damn near daily since $8 dips..*bought sold and profited through coinbase
4
I just checked. Their fee is 0.6% for buy orders until you're monthly volume is >$10,000...But still, better than coinabse normal fees.
3
Maybe it's CB advanced now? Seems very similar, can be toggled in the coinbase ui under profile.

This happened on my mother's account. I had to help her because CB was stonewalling her, I wrote it as if it was my money because she wanted to write it and she doesn't have a Reddit.

I onboarded 2.2k 4-5 months ago using kraken and worked up from there, I don't need to onboard anymore, I just day trade.
1
Oh really? Then what was the issue? Please enlighten us! Why is this happening during times where the market is down? Do you know what the market can do to $31B in less than 60 seconds? ..There are a lot of big banks that supposedly have a WAY bigger market cap and guess what? They had bank runs that left a lot of people shit out of their own money. Don't think it can't happen to Coinbase, do you remember FTX? Wasn't that long ago friend. Wake up
-1
Fees in general? Or withdraw specific?   ActiveTrader on Gemini and KrakenPro have some of the lowest trade fees in the industry.
2
You should consider researching or using the things you're putting your money into.. :)

I'm 36. I'm much wiser and handsomer than you!

No problem!

When the Solana *market price* went down. The network was fine the entire time. Coinbase claimed it was the network and that was bullshit. As soon as I got a manager like 14-ish hours later, they released the funds immediately. It was not the network.
2
How long do you HODL before selling?

I'm not saying people haven't profited off of it, I'm saying it's not a good asset to hold long term. Devs always doing shady shit for their own benefit.

You're like the millionth 25 year old Redditor that has claimed they got in on SOL at $8.

So u used a cex to onboard. What’s ur alternative to on-boarding through cex
1
Rich telling other people to wake up about FTX while posting about trying to move SOL from "money trouble" Coinbase to "Solflare". You realize that Solana was FTX's blockchain, bought and paid for? They hope everyone eventually forgets that but you're too smart to remember...You're right that Coinbase is centralized and there's always a risk to keeping assets there. It's also extremely regulated at this point and will continue to be the offramp of choice for the majority of us who convert crypto to USD and realize gains on occasion, and pay taxes. It's also 12 years old. Thinking your funds are somehow safer on a 4 year-old FTX blockchain with a history of crashing and questionable (at best) decentralization is foolish. I would wager a lot that Coinbase will still be around in 10 years. Solana could go to 0; you cannot hand wave away all of the red flags.
12
You can’t be serious.
5
Ok so for Kraken you would have to be using $250k for makers and $10mil for takers to get the same fees that I have using any amount on Jupiter. Gemini, maker fees are the same but only if you are using $10k or above and  taker fees you would have to be using $5mil to get the same fees as Jupiter.
2
You should consider what you call "research" isn't shit. I'll trust the US government and institutionalized investors looking out for themselves and their money as a good sign that things are square. 
-2
Just imagine how much more handsome and wise you will be at 38 like me!
11
Did you verify that, or just saying it? Don’t you think their network activity would spike with a drastic price change?
2
That depends on the coin, when I acquired it, what I acquired it for on average, and where it is price wise but for the most part I just do what makes sense for me financially!
2
How long is long term? Are we going with US capital gains definition? If so I’ll argue on that with you for a little! ..I’m honestly for the first time in years uncomfortable to talk about the money solana has made me, long term. Granted I bought around the $200s so I had to chase that sunk cost fallacy and beat that average cost down until it was a winner and now with an average of $10-11 I’m loving it, long term of course!

Day trade crypto? Have fun behind wendy’s!

You want me to link the CB support conversation? Because I am happy to.

And here I literally explained that I wrote this for my mother.

Does Jupiter allow for ACH and Wires?  It’s the on-ramp/offramp aspect that allow CEXs to charge a premium.
2
I'm not talking about coinbase, I'm talking about crypto lol

yes, I verified it 4 times, do you want me to link the conversation with support?

Lol great, literally any coin that you bought in this last bear market is going to make people short term gains. Good luck in the future.

Why not in the original post?..This makes everything you said suspicious.

Nope, you can choose to off-board and onboard anywhere you like after using Jup
2
Then why do you assume I don't? 
1
Is it an exponential growth curve, my dear sir? Are you growing more handsomer by the day and approaching infinity? Are you the final phase of a chatgpt picture becoming more and more handsome?
4
Thanks but I don’t quite care that much. I just think it’s funny to hear people defend SOL. A crypto built by the financial system will surely free us from the financial system and also make us regular folks all rich in the process.
3
Oh you’re still not understanding I’m sorry! My average cost is $10 and change I will make money off Solana until it’s below that price (long term)
2
If you don't want to take my word for it, that's fine with me. If you want to use Coinbase, go for it, that's fine with me too, it's your (Coinbase's) crypto. But clearly there are a lot of other people having similar problems with Coinbase and this is absolutely not right of them to do as a company. If you can't understand the story because I wrote it for my mom and it's too suspicious at that point, fine. Keep doing Coinbase.
1
> all i have ever used is coinbase and never anywhere else..This and you referring to jupiter as a scummy sounding site makes me think you've never used a dapp or even a wallet
3
I quit my job and now I make almost double monthly what I was making trading on the Solana network, it's working out fine for me. You are entitled to your own opinion though!
1
Yes I understand, I still don't like or trust the asset. I'm a little more risk off though I bought as much BTC as I could when it was below 20K. But if SOL is doing good then BTC is most certainly doing good too, so I truly wish you good luck in the future...Edit: typo

Don’t patronize me when you’re the one putting yourself in this situation.

Title: Are Real-World Assets (RWAs) the Next Big Thing in Cryptocurrency ?

I gotta be honest, this is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. “Rather than owning a work of art or a house, investors can own fractions of it.” Imagine someone saying: “I own 0.003% of the Mona Lisa. Well - not the *actual* Mona Lisa, the digital version.”
1
Some projects tried this and it got shut down by the SEC.  Saw this with the NFT share of real estate and the idea was that nft holders will get a monthly cash flow from the real estate.
1
I am not touching real stuff anymore, all in on digital.
1
lmao, nothing. They just want distance between the bad rep NFT's have gotten so it's a rebrand. .    .It won't work.
10
Rwa example is opuls chek them out
1
Tokenization of a bond has far more uses than tokenization of a picture.
1
A real world asset can be represented by an NFT, but an NFT doesn't have to relate to a real world asset.  An example of an RWA is a digital event ticket.  It can now be an NFT that is tradable and can have perks and rewards attached to it...An example of an NFT that is not associated with RWA would be a membership to a club or organization.  Ownership of the NFT acts as access to the club and can provide various benefits.
1
NFT is a broad term just meaning it’s a 1 of 1, unique tokens that’s non-fungible. RWA are tokenized representations of ownership of physical assets like commodities for example. These tokens could theoretically be traded on decentralized exchanges and open the doors to peer to peer trading of real world assets in a trust-less way. It a revolutionary idea that’s yet so see large scale implementation.
1
NFT is a non-fungible token, a wording they used to say a digital 1-1. Digital medium can be copied easily though...RWA are going to be real, physical assets. You can't copy a real physical asset...This is the original way that NFT's were being used prior to their weird craze where they wanted to switch it's use to something that can be digitally copied...RWA is more like old school NFT's. NFT's were in the very very beginning used mostly for online art, it was a way to codify in a ledger "I made this painting/digital art/digital whatever, and this is my license of proof"...Why it went from that to "This is a special license that shows I have this and that no one else can have it and we'll put this on a mass scale blockchain" is totally off track for what the original purpose was of NFT's...What they are saying above with RWA is that ledgers that contain what a company owns or an individual owns can be more safely stored securely and efficiently by way of a blockchain. This will allow hashing and proof of ownership of real world assets - think books or songs or art or houses or cars or accounts or medical history, etc. etc...Blockchain is by far the most secure way we know of right now to log all of this and have it be able to integrate with other blockchains. This has been taking forever to finally fructify due to regulations and banks etc. but it looks like that's what they are referring to; not some NFT 2.0 idea.../rant (I'm fully against NFT's! I was using them prior to the weird NFT craze and they were not even sort of being thought of as what they are now, so maybe this is going to do the same, idk.)

Yup. Reminds me of an episode of it’s always sunny. ..It’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a [reverse funnel system.](https://youtu.be/RqePdfvOeiY?si=FLr5OiSvsq-6ObuZ)

it’s always been a deed. Some prove ownership of jpegs but in reality they could prove ownership of any asset.

Title: Does Bitcoin ETF approval signals the Bull-run?

I think BTC dominance will continue rising (it's already rebounded strongly) and alts will stagnate for a while. Eventually all boats will rise.
16
look what happened to gold after it got an etf in 2004
8
The whole thing is fishy. How is the price so high when the volumes are so low? The interest rates are too high, with what money is this happening?..Smells like a giant bull trap.
16
We have been in a raging bull market for a year straight and will continue to be well past the ETF and halving. If you are not plowing all possible funds into quality spot positions you may end up as exit liquidity for this cycle
4
Buy the rumor, sell the news.
2
Yes. No. Maybe. Not sure.

Hard to say short term but the halvening is only a few months away at which point the bull run should soon follow it if history is any kind of indicator, not to mention its S2F leapfrogs gold after this next halvening.
2
Lololololoolloloololloolol
-2
plot twist, blackrock is satoshi
1
Seeing the market respond to news of ETF rate fees filing by applicants yesterday, it has added to the growing expectations of a bull run. However, I just hope traditional financial institutions doesn't overshadow crypto exchanges in market dominance...Though, I can see some exchanges like HTX and Bitget making moves to compete for those volumes by holding some events and even launching a timer for the expected day of approval (Wednesday 10/01/24)

CryptoQuant and QCP Capital have similar perceptions that is  why they feel we could see a dip but the market have outplayed us many times.

Yeah, You could be right bruh, seeing all these happenings I'd be leveraging on the Smart Portfolio bot product or grid trading of the trade smarter platform to my advantage so as to not incur losses if actually it's a bull trap.

Yah
1
Yeah but there are other analysis that suggest BTC retesting previous ATH prior to halving. Could this ETF approval ignite that?
1
I don’t know. Can you repeat the question
2
Well there are many indications that the bull-run is near but analyst are divided on what will pave the way. I will be glad if we keep the green candles for a longer time but only whales have that decisions.
2
It always has been.
1
Definitely but ETH ETF is not close
6
That is true. I don’t know what to expect and could be totally different then makes sense, just saying that it’s highly suspicious.
1
Life is unfair.
1
I disagree. The halvening is in April iirc and when that happens bitcoin technically becomes a scarcer asset then gold. Also if you look at the current metrics of number of wallets holding BTC, duration of BTC held in those wallets and consider the fact crypto is being adopted over 150% faster then the internet in its first 15 years I don’t think whales are the end all be all to bitcoin price. ..Also following every halvening to date we see crypto reach new all time highs. It’s the closest thing to clockwork you get in markets afaik. ..I also think we could see a snowball effect take place in regards to El Salvador. If BTC reaches new all time highs (which it almost certainly will) El Salvador will go from being a traditionally poor nation to one of the wealthiest nations per capita. I think this will prompt a bunch of other small traditionally poorer nations to adopt the same approach as El Salvador taking us from the enterprise level of adoption to the nation state level of adoption more quickly then previous transition times.

Cardano. Unpopular opinion but cardano is much safer then eth and Solana. Solana has crashed plenty of times and cardano has better security then eth. Time will reveal all flaws
41
I don't care about anything but monero anymore.

Algorand. It is a joy to use, fast finality and simple and it seems that it is one of the few blockchains that ticks all the boxes to be potentially used for a CBDC. At least ECB seems to be looking into it.
23
Cardano.  Its built to last and very secure, someone tried to attack it recently, they had minimal impact and lost their funds...You can participate in staking without ever locking or having your funds slashed, and you get paid directly in ADA not some hokey derivatives...Its also one of the few where you get to decide how it develops over time.

I still believe that LINK doesn't get the attention they deserve. After all these years on the market, being probably the best oracle we had so far. ASI is heavily undervalued and imo people are not talking nearly enough about it. it's not everyday thing to see there giant projects in one niche merging their tokens and forces together in order to create something massive. i know that some people think that AI hype is diluted but that is a nonsense. soon it will be clear for everyone. i deeply believe that ASI is a chance we should not miss.

Polyswarm. Insanely undervalued. One of the best uses for crypto I have seen. It is like VirusTotal but the engines are automatically paid for their accurate threat assessments (there is a complex system to determine accuracy).

Combining all of those niche engines provides way better coverage. They have clients like ebay and verizon.

For me, it's TRIAS, AAVE and RIZ. TRIAS is a project you won't see any influencer shilling and always performs well and keeps building. While AAVE is so easy to use and I like all its DeFi features. Then there is also RIZ, the upcoming token of the Rivalz network, which is one of my favorites with its zNodes and rNodes that reward participants.

DZHV. The developer is truly innovative and passionate about bringing value.  Right now it's at rock bottom.  When he releases the bridge he's working on, it will skyrocket.

$Dark from Darkf.fi a fully anonymouse chain but they are still pre token right now. But they have the potential to be the next ETH

CKB as it is the one that will directly scale bitcoin

They are also constantly working to maximize tps with a current lifetime max of 5,716 tps.

I am also big on ADA. Yes, it's taking a long time to develop, but I'll take security of the protocol over time to the market any day. I also enjoy the flexibility and control over my ADA.

Value proposition?.Institutional client revenue?.Because I know their retail customers are not doing significant volume..How do their active devs compare to ETH and SOL?

Official website https://nano.org/en if you want more nuanced info about development please ask this in main nano sub there are devs there that can answer. I am not dev I am just huge fan of nano and don’t want to give you impression that some fan boy is astroturfing. I am not affiliated with nano team in any way it just aligns with my philosophy. It is ecological fast and feeless on chain.
0
What do you mean by value proposition? Nano doesn’t have institutional client I personally don’t know about any. It had similair problem like BTC at start when mtgox got hacked and Bitcoin was stolen. In nanos case someone hacked exchange bitgrail and nano was stolen it had impact on price but fundamentals of nanos code got better from info I read from devs.
0
Nano is still developed and working exactly as advertised. If you base projects value on price that is imho not good indicator.

I got downvoted and Reddit is usually wrong, late or both with good investment opportunities. This is literally my market research. Cardano was a great bet last cycle but is now just bag holders who refuse to look at new opportunities that are massively outperforming (sorry)

Title: Do you still believe in Buy the FUD and sell the News?

..>Do you still believe in Buy the FUD and sell the News?..No, because that's never been how the saying went.
21
Buy low + hold high + DCA. (Is what I do)..&#x200B;..Low: (Positive indicators)..\- People say the thing sucks..\- People make fun of you..\- News says thing is broken..\- The value of the thing (according to you / some concrete reasons) has growth potential..&#x200B;..High: (Negative indicators)..\- Everyone is excited..\- Lots of FOMO, (If I bought earlier)..\- News announcements demanding fast action..\- Famous people or products ..\- Recent price run up

Buy the rumor sell the news has worked very well for me throughout the years. BTC going down after the ETF was approved was exactly what I expected. ..The buying pressure from ETF will take some time to manifest.

FUD is the best time to buy. Sell when it's positive news

No one is questioning the 3 sleezy SEC caused issues of the bitcoin spot ETF .. ..(1) the forcing of USD instead of BTC settlements - overtly rediculous when Compared to spot gold ETF or other commodity … possibly just for SEC staff to get kickback off the added fees for those extra transactions by JP Morgan and Goldman Sacs .. ..(2)the SECs little $2 billion “ accidental hack ” of a fake jan 9 , 2024 approval vs the so called real jan 10, 2024 approval … ..(3) the rediculously hard to find 30+ page SEC spot bitcoin ETF approval document itself.. do you have copy ? ..(Did you see in that approval document that a couple of the spot ETF were verbally approved earlier in the week by Gary G.)..Looks like the USA govt and SEC may be  outlaws now and we the people do nothing. Sad.

If it was a tax free cash gift to my personal account I would use it to max out tax free investment vehicles (country dependent) and max out btc and eth etfs (we have eth etfs here).  Can’t do better than tax free long-term crypto gains. ..If not tax free would use to buy alts mostly. That’a what I’m scaling in now more than btc/eth although have positions in both and eth is still my largest bag.

$100k is no chump change to ***invest***. I'd do my homework into the coin's fundamentals. A few that come to mind:..1. Is the coin a layer 1 or 2 coin? If L2 coin, what L1 is it on?.2. For L1 coins:.   1. What's the acc't model? utxo like btc or global acc't like eth?.   2. Does it have a fixed supply? 21million btc or sky's the limit like fiat.   3. Development philosophy? go fast and break things or slow n steady research based.   4. Development style and language - safe, high assurance using functional languages such as Haskell or everyday, more popular languages?.   5. Initial coin distribution (ICO) - fair with majority going to the public or majority being held privately by devs, VCs...   6. Transactions.      1. speed / chain tps.      2. cost.   7. Chain reliability - does it go down?.   8. Anonymity.   9. PoW or PoS.   10. Smart contracts.   11. Liquid staking.   12. Governance.   13. and a whole lot more that others can add..

BTC / ETH probably. 90% of the ecosystem is built on these, so the whole industry would have to die before these do...Nobody REALLY needs the others for any mission critical systems that deliver tangible value. I would say 99% of the other projects are serving needs to the other 99% of projects. So. Much. DeFi.

I would go all in on SOL , I’m a Solana maxi though

I'll also buy some BTC and diversify the remaining into low market cap utility tokens like DUA, NXRA, QANX, and RIO. These have promising long-term growth potential.

Finally, some sense
4
Rationale?
2
I have a feeling that if you research into all of that, you're highly likely to go for a lot of ADA?
6
Why monero? That's something they could easily go after and ban as it's main purpose is anonymity so they can use scars tactics and ban all exchanges from allowing it.

If you don’t mind me asking, why PYTH? I’ve seen it thrown around here and there and figured I’d ask what the hype is about.

Eth, Sol, Xrm are shitcoins? K, lol

Eth?

Actually... not so sure.. some stupid meme like shib.. but i want completely new token...I read a lot about radix but not convinced.
1
I don't want to influence anyone, but a 100k is a lot so I'd try to handle it like how the hedge fund pro's would handle it (ie. do as much research to get as much insight as I can.) Good luck everyone. Looking forward to the day when crypto frees us from the shackles (and baggage) of fiat.
2
They can’t ban people from using it it’s a decentralised computer program but removing it from exchanges will likely only make it more valuable in the long run. ..It’s a digital cash that solves one of the problems outlined by satoshi in the btc white paper..It was created by someone under a pseudonym aswell nobody knows who made it and the way the whitepaper is written is in a similar style and structure to the btc whitepaper

monero xmr is not going anywhere it’s going to go up a lot of dnm are only accepting them
1
I am a sol maxi that’s why I said he should go all in on SOL , but that’s just my suggestion because I’m a SOL maxi

Sentiment is so low right now, and there is way too many posts about people selling their XRP for other tokens. Case ends April so I expect a big pump in to a dump.

Bitcoin is not a utilitarian crypto. It is money, plain and simple. It's decentralized, borderless, weightless, deflationary. It will eventually become to global reserve currency. Governments, international corporations and all large scale transactions will be made in Bitcoin...Example. Russia and China want to fuck over the USA right? Well they trade commodities very often on a major scale. Normally they have no choice but to settle in USD because Russia does not want yuan and China does not want rubles. They both ultimately would like something stable that has actual value like gold. But with gold you have to ship it, insure it, store it, secure it etc. Eventually they will realize and cave, and start trading in BTC.  You can make a billion dollar transaction if you want with no middleman and for very little fees or added costs. ..Bitcoin is absolutely unstoppable.  If the government tries to accuse you of something and wants to seize your assets, and want your Bitcoin, they can't get them. "I hit my head and forgot my seed phrase" they can never force it out of you. ..If you really want to use BTC as currency, the lightning network is great.  Extremely low fees, extremely fast and can instantly be converted to whatever local currency the recipient wants. If you want to buy an orange from a fruit stand in Colombia you can send BTC and the fruit stand owner can receive pesos. ..It's perfect, and I have a weird feeling that a time traveler from the future brought it to us to save us from ourselves.

They are stout networks, especially Ethereum. But they are centralized besides monero. Monero is good for money laundering and tax evasion so I think it's a good network. But you're missing the point. Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized, deflationary money. ..I'm not saying that those coins are bad investments, but I'm not really interested in making $usd profits off of crypto. My only goal is to accumulate Bitcoin.

Yes, proof of stake is proof of shit. Richest nodes on the PoS network can influence it. Proof of work requires raw compute power

Lol those are 100% shitcoins dude. Especially sol lmfao. Wtf is xrm? You mean xrp?? Eth is all secretly owned by Jeff bezos so fuck that.
1
It has value but because it is still somewhat centralized I would consider it a top tier shitcoin. The Ethereum network is revolutionary but you're still putting your faith in a company somewhat.

I’d love to hear your take on sol if you wouldn’t mind. I have a bag and genuinely interested in the motivation to be a maxi
