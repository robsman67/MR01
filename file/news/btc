Title: Bitcoin network activity hitting three year lows
3
This feels like the natural progression of a blockchain that pushes activity to L2 networks and touts itself as a "store of value". Why would active addresses maintain year over year or increase when transaction costs and transaction confirmations are unpredictable, L2 networks are preferred for "scaling", and the rhetoric is to hodl now to sell later?

Nice, GPU accelerated signature verification would be foundational for low cost World scale p2p cash....Jtoomin made a throwaway comment a few years ago about full sync from Genesis in minutes on a 1080....A well thought out UTXO set 'architecture' would allow wallets to query balances of specific addresses (from many nodes) building up a FULL picture of Wallet Balance **with minimal loss of privacy**. (prospective non zero addresses are found **locally** by the wallet using a bloom type filter of the current UTXO set)....I liked Calins ideas on bucketed UTXO commitments....Each bucket could then be trustlessly merkleized after the fact - not part of consensus so NO impact on mining or nodes that don't care....*Benifit* ..* At 1k buckets, we only download 1/10,000 of whole UTXO set to prove inclusion OR exclusion (1k for the buckets and you only need TXID which for 2in2out is 1/10 the size)..* With UTXO commitments it is easy to **PROVE**  ..   * 21M cap is in place..   * Any received coin **will** be accepted by the network on spending...   * Miner malfeasance spending coins that don't exist etc.. .With Gigabyte blocks and 1k buckets, proof would be of the order of 1 block (a few GB) **most importantly provable with consumer grade hardware and bandwidth**...What's not to like....--------------...**We might *HAVE* been in the gutter but we always had our eyes on the Stars**

> why the U.S. government has an "exit tax" for renouncing citizenship..Because the US is one of only two banana republics to tax their citizens living abroad, the other being Eritrea, often described as the north korea of africa.
19
Possibly relevant, but I know nothing about the case: Crimes are protected by privilege. You can't just commit crimes through a lawyer and say it's privileged. If that was the case, lawyers would be involved in 100% of criminal conversation and nothing could ever be used in court.
2
>Did they raid the firm or hack into its system?..As far as I know, the emails were handed over voluntarily without any raid or hack...>It raises the question: is this really about taxes, or does it have more to do with Roger being a vocal libertarian and anti-tax advocate?..Roger's an anarchist, not a libertarian. I think it's just as likely the government is going after him because they simply want to take his money (and everybody else's) as it is they're doing this to make an example out of him, or it could be a mix of both...>What’s the deal with him being stuck in Spain?..They're trying to extradite him to the USA for trial...>If selling a ton of Bitcoin back then would have tanked the market, why does it matter how much he had for tax purposes?..Because the sale would, in theory, not yield enough to cover the tax bill. This might be remedied by a new law which was recently proposed by Congressman Gaetz which would allow US taxes to be paid directly with bitcoin...>And seriously, why do you get penalized (exit tax) for giving up U.S. citizenship? Isn’t that just a way to keep people from leaving?..You answered your own question. They don't want people benefitting from the American economy to leave without giving back a ton of money.
3
Re the "confidential" info, there is a [crime-fraud exception](https://www.justia.com/criminal/working-with-a-criminal-lawyer/the-crime-fraud-exception/) to the attorney-client privilege. If Ver provided fraudlent asset lists to law firms in order to further an illegal scheme, the government could lawfully subpoena or execute a search warrant for those.

1 Roger likely hired the lawyers to help fill out his exit tax paperwork, which would have included that information...4 Because they're slow AF, and kinda dumb...5 Part of living in the US is getting the benefits of the infrastructure paid for by tax dollars. The schools, the roads, the security of not having roaming mobs of bandits robbing your house every week, etc. It's not very fair to the rest of the tax paying public if someone rides on social services to get wealthy, and then leaves before paying back into the system that helped them get wealthy, so they take an exit tax...Exit taxes only apply to people who have more than $2m, or people who haven't paid their taxes recently. BTC was 10 dollars when he filed, so 25k coins would only have been $250k. Sounds like he qualified, but 25k BTC would not have made a meaningful difference on the form. Back then it would basically be like telling them he had a giant box of pokemon cards. He probably should have done it, but he would likely have gotten laughed at for adding it...Anyway, seems like a pretty straightforward thing. He should pay whatever difference those BTC would have made (obviously priced in USD) and be on his way.
-3
Exit tax sounds reasonable. Otherwise if I make a billion dollars, I just jump overseas and avoid the taxes.
-5
Fraud/crime is not protected by privilege, I'm not a lawyer but my guess is that once the government has enough proof the crime is being committed through the lawyer, they can subpoena the law firm. Again, NAL, but there must be some way for the government to get this information as they are legally allowed to get it.

I wonder why he deleted his account recently.

That is not true the US is one of 3 countries that tax its citizens when they are abroad but there are several countries that have some form of exit tax. Such as Australia, Canada, Eritrea, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, and United States.

Australia too. Not that uncommon. For au you’re liable for the difference between the tax you pay overseas and you would have paid here.

He already paid taxes when he was a citizen and he and his parents paid that share of "social services".  Disagree if you like, but I am not a supporter of the idea of double jeopardy.
5
> It's not very fair to the rest of the tax paying public if someone rides on social services to get wealthy..It wouldn't be fair, but this also never happens. Unless I've just never heard of anybody getting rich off the social services in the US unless it's the owners/operators of said services or their hired buddies.
4
That doesn't make any sense.  He was already taxed for his business as a US citizen before he left.  The argument that that money needs to be taxed again in order to leave is just double jeopardy. And any business he might be a part of that is doing business in the USA is already getting taxed anyway.
6
How about just stipulating that those investments must remain US-based, at least for some time, but not have them be confiscated by the government?..At some point reason went out the window and now everyone accepts such theft - for lack of a better word - as normal...> Exit tax sounds reasonable..I'll play advocate for not having expatriation taxes (similar to but not necessarily the same as what are broadly called exit taxes), for a second...First of all, it's not the norm in most countries. As in, it's only a thing in a handful of states (including of course the US)...I'll contend that an expatriation tax unfairly punishes the citizenry when the departure of citizens occurs when they are unhappy or disadvantaged by the state, and unhappy about it, and it should squarely be the state that is disincentivized from making its citizenry unhappy. Exit taxes punish the little guy, not the state...Let's look at an historic example:..> In December 1931, the Reich Flight Tax was implemented as part of a larger emergency decree with the goal of stemming capital flight during the unstable interwar period. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, the Nazi government largely used the tax to confiscate assets from persecuted people (mostly Jews) who sought to flee Nazi Germany...To add insult to injury, apparently the new US Code Section 877A is prepared to tax you on gains not even made in the US...> It is irrelevant that the gains may have partly arisen before the taxpayer moved to the U.S. ..Would the people claiming how it's reasonable to be taxed on gains made while _in_ a certain country, also feel inclined to support being taxed on gains made before even moving to that country?..I suppose taxation is a slippery slope where eventually, people agree to anything.

What are you talking about? It's right here: https://old.reddit.com/user/MemoryDealers

Australia does not tax citizens that have registered as non residents. The only countries that tax non resident citizens are the US, Eritrea and the Philippines. It is very uncommon given there are 190 countries that don't do this.
6
I'm doing pretty well for myself, and I very much depended on social services when I was growing up. I'm doing well enough that if I wanted to leave the US, I'd be paying the exit tax, and I'd be happy to pay it...There's a ton of room for improvement in the basic services provided to every US citizen, and the system absolutely does not work for everyone, but it's something, and I'm glad it helped me become the person I am. I went to public school and state college, and currently pay a solid chonk of taxes, and I'm happy to support the next generation that weren't lucky enough to be born into a well off family. My kid is in a fancy private school that my parents never would have been able to afford, but I still believe that raising the quality of life for everyone is the best path towards advancing as a society.

Nope, you are the product of the society you were raised in...The idea that some wealthy people are self-made rugged individuals that never got lucky and never had help from anyone else is a pure fantasy that greedy assholes use to pull up the ladder behind them, and prevent others from succeeding in the same way they did. Every single wealthy person built their wealth on the shoulders of the community they were raised in. They made valuable connections, and had a sequence of incredibly lucky breaks that led them to where they are...The "rugged individual" delusion is a lie that some wealthy people might actually believe, but it's mostly used to trick poor people into staying poor.

No mate- he was able to build wealth through having the support of a strong social system and the infrastructure that goes with that. I have a similar story, growing up in a relatively low income household, and it was only with government support (primarily the education system and state support for my single mother) that I was able to move into higher education and have a pretty great professional career. ..And unlike Roger I’ve paid taxes on all of my crypto investments (the first being 2011), and so you can imagine that’s a fair chunk of change back into the tax system. And like the poster above, I’m happy to do so because it provides for those who don’t have enough means at the lower end, and offsets the selfish intent of other wealthy individuals who don’t pay their taxes (ironically, when they are most able to do so).
-3
I do, I pay taxes every year. People who leave would no longer be paying back into that system, so they make a one time payment to exit.
1
I don't think a social safety net is necessarily a bad thing (although it can over-develop into a net negative), nor do I think it needs to be funded on an involuntary basis, which is what is currently happening...I find it bizarre that people don't see that such redistributory systems do not create wealth (*), they just create a little more opportunity for people to have a decent start...---..(*) here I'll re-iterate that when these systems fall under corporate control, they absolutely can funnel great wealth to a few individuals. But that's a perversion of the original intent...Nothing wrong with pooling funding to achieve mutual benefit, in my book. It's the "how" that matters and determines the fate of the mechanism.
3
The people created the government, not the other way around.
2
Just to put it in to perspective the public school system receives about 8% of there funding from the federal government...If you leave the US and have a net worth of $2mil and pay a 30% tax that is $600,000. 8% of that is $48,000 now there are a little over 98,000 public schools so for every $2mil taxed when leaving each school would get $0.49. Even if he had a net worth of $200mil every school would get $49.
1
Of course, people created the government so they could live in more peaceful and cohesive societies. Obviously there are lots of improvements that could be made, but at its core, governments are there to work for the people, and provide a higher quality of life to its citizens.

Yes, this is how big numbers work. Everyone pays a little bit into the system, and the system can provide support where it's most needed.

Read Hijacking Bitcoin.  It explains the history and how it started off with utility which was slowly stripped away and replaced with the "store of value" mantra.

>  can Bitcoin evolve to offer more utility?..In theory, yes. In practice BTC has lost utility whilst whilst it's rivals (principally BCH) have gained utility...https://whybitcoincash.com

Yes, Bitcoin will have more utility, beyond just a store of value. ..There's been explosive growth in the development of Bitcoin L2s, and as a docking layer, ExSat is working on creating the first decentralized on-chain UTXO data layer for Bitcoin, thereby helping BTCL2s and dApps in the Bitcoin ecosystem thrive. This will surely lead to more use cases for BTC and more dApps being built on Bitcoin in general.

2
> BCH should not exist.....I was going to down-vote that claim, but in some respect you're right, BCH shouldn't exist, but it does. Die-hard BTC supporters certainly need it die because each year BCH persists it continues to erode their narrative...In fact.....* BCH is only about $200 per coin short of being back in the top 10 coins by market cap. Climbing back from the low-30s on the list, BCH continues to creep up on the there-can-only-be-one narrative..* It operates perfectly well and fine on 1/200^th the hash rate of BTC, absolutely destroying the idea that it takes a massive amount of hashing to be secure..* One would think that any massive Mining effort could simply point their machines at BCH and wreak havoc. But no, the game theory is working perfectly well and there's no incentive to do so BCH is secure and lives on..* There's a massive disinfo campaign that shits all over BCH, but it's doing just fine all the while performing the exact same services, only it does so much cheaper and faster while including the instant zero-conf option for lower-risk trxs...So stop and ask why does BCH exist? The marketplace likes options (but it doesn't like a lot of options). So even if tomorrow BCH were to become the SHA-256 leader, BTC wouldn't go away. So the fact that the market has room for both (but not much more room for a 3rd or 4th) then it will exist. And someday when the market frenzy turns to a collective yawn and moves on to the next shiny thing, people will actually read and compare the BTC and BCH *prospectus* and make a real buy decision... which at the moment heavily favors BCH.

So, your money is devaluing because the global reserve currency has spent $1 trillion just on interest payments in the past two months...What will you choose to invest in? You can’t save your money because it’s losing value. You **HAVE TO** invest...Then there's Bitcoin, arguably the investment that comes closest to saving, largely due to its store of value aspect...The fact that you consider its store of value aspect useless suggests that your IQ might not even reach the fucking median.

You could convert your money into classic cars, ownership of a company that provides value, or a cryptocurrency like BCH that actually has the potential for use by merchants and consumers...If BTC had no potential for true net appreciation, no one would find it attractive. As the potential for gain appreciates other assets that have far less risk, BTC unadoption will accelerate faster than today.

Same. I thought it was either malicious or the directives lost their mind and went full "COMPLY" mode. Try Selene wallet guys.

Bitcoin.com is not open source...Don't want to sound too harsh: But only stupid people would use or even recommend it.

Wow I just checked and saw it too. But I think it's for their verse ponzi token. Kyc required due to regulations if you want to participate.

This took me by surprise. Also,  I have been spreading the Bitcoin Cash message with the shareable link feature to get new users. Now, this happens and totally makes my work harder and confused the new users.   ..This screwed up what was a well run wallet, now it's slowly losing ground to competition

well fuck. Has anyone tried sending from their bitcoin.com wallet to an outside wallet? Was KYC required? If it was, fucking hell.

I like Blue Wallet. It’s decentralized, you can create numerous BTC wallets within it and has some unique security features.

What would you recommend then?  I have other wallets but I was using bitcoin.com specifically for bitcoin cash.  Lack of open source isn't a deal breaker for me per se.
5
Haha that means my decision is already made.  Hopefully they'll let me unstake it without...

I don't think they can stop you. The wallet itself is non custodial.  Worse case scenario you put your key phrase in a different wallet.
3
You will be fine regardless. Extract the secret phrase and you can use any non-custodial wallet to access your coins. You clearly will not need KYC since this is non-custodial. However, bitcoincom is not open source.

Title: Updates to CHIP-2024-07-BigInt: High-Precision Arithmetic for Bitcoin Cash
25
Thanks for the summary. I hope we get that CHIP live this upgrade cycle!
6
Our benchmarking is focused on C++ and javascript, to give a wide cross section of runtime environments to look at performance across...One question however is, are we benchmarking across different hardware architectures? Just thinking about this, different CPUs could have different types of hardware acceleration which may make some mathematical operations faster or slower, unique to that specific hardware. Perhaps some hardware may have built in crypto operations that some of the libraries are using. The runtimes we are testing will be compiled to take advantage of different hardware, so on one CPU everything may look really good, but maybe there is a worst-case CPU out there that shows differences. ..In general, do we have a conception of which might be the worst-case type of CPU or hardware? ..I think this applies to both VM limits and big ints.
4
Looks like there is no Risks section in the VM Limits CHIP. I think we should definitely have a risks section, as there are always risks even if they are small. It mainly shows we've taken everything into account...Also, I think it would be good to add a Security section into these. Even basic stuff like what is a stack overflow bug/attack, or what class of security things do we need to think about. Its mostly remedial knowledge but security is its own thing that not everybody is super educated about, and by laying out some basic info on security aspects, that shows what we've thought about. And someone who is a security expert (but maybe not BCH or VM) could look at the security section and see if we are covering everything that we think we are...I think the previous int size upgrade CHIP didn't have much detailed info, so some of the security stuff could maybe discuss that...I know its easy for me to ask for other people to do a lot of work, so sorry for that. But I think its hard to go wrong by adding security and risks, and also adding some of this extra information can help turn these CHIPs into a great reference library.
5
I have no comment on the CHIP itself, it's beyond my knowledge base, but I do think some attention to u/d05CE 's comments would be a good idea.
4
me too, very exciting upgrade!
5
When it comes to BigInt I wouldn't expect any surprises, because the BigInt library is using basic native arithmetic int64 ops under the hood, and all CPUs implement basic arithmetic ops :) [No CPU really has an advantage](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37890191) there because none have special instructions for BigInt, so if none has an advantage, then none are disadvantaged...We only have basic math opcodes: add, sub, mul, div, mod, and algorithms for higher precision are well known and "big O" is well understood, I found some [nice docs here](https://github.com/gavinhoward/bc/blob/master/manuals/algorithms.md) (from `bc` documentation, it is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language, and interpreter binary ships with most Linux distros)...32bit CPUs would be disadvantaged (and they already are for most ops), but who uses those anymore? and we gotta deprecate them anyway if we're to scale beyond 1GB, can't support 2009 HW forever, our scalability depends on people actually moving to newer and newer hardware, that's how scaling with Moore's law works...>Perhaps some hardware may have built in crypto operations that some of the libraries are using...Modern CPUs do have [sha256 extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_SHA_extensions), and whatever difference exists would already have impacted them, because you need to do a lot of hashing already for P2PKH. The VM limits sets a [hash density limit](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#selection-of-hashing-limit) to keep things the same, both typical case and worst case...>In general, do we have a conception of which might be the worst-case type of CPU or hardware?..IDK, but I'd like to see a benchmark run on some RPi :)..Also, we can't allow ourselves to be dragged down by the worst-case CPU, like, our scalability relies on the assumption of tech improving with time but for that people have to actually upgrade the hardware to get along with the times. We are now in 2024, we can't be dragged down because maybe some 2010 CPU can't keep up...So, whatever worst-case should really be picked from some cheap tier of modern CPUs, like 5-10 years old.
6
Yeah good point, VM limits CHIP could use a risks section too, I'll see what I can do..Re. security, I'm not sure what to cover, like, overflows etc. are just generic implementation risks...ABLA needed some [special consideration](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa#security-analysis), because the operating bounds can expand with time so we will need to stay ahead with our testing to be sure no surprises...P2SH32 needed more consideration, but I didn't want to bloat the CHIP with those so [it just links](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/p2sh32#security-analysis) to the technical bulletin...With VM limits, bounds will be fixed, so you test -MAX, -1, 0, 1, MAX, some random values in between, and you're good, right?..Anyway, yeah, there's def. room for a small section, just to say the same thing I said above.
5
> So, whatever worst-case should really be picked from some cheap tier of modern CPUs, like 5-10 years old...I agree this is the right approach. I think a couple version of Raspberry pi and also benchmarking on the cheapest tier of cloud server CPUs would be good...I think we definitely should go through with the exercise because benchmarking performance on a single random piece of hardware seems to be a risk. I think in our Risks section we should mention the hardware being used.
3
> Re. security, I'm not sure what to cover, like, overflows etc. are just generic implementation risks...Right, in theory this CHIP is a spec, and as such its up to the implementers and script writers to take care of security. But I think a discussion of security that implementers and script writers can read talking about what types of pitfalls to think about would be appropriate, even if just pointers to some relevant external resources. I'm not trying to add confusion, just thinking some kind of security assessment is appropriate given these are mathematical operations that will be calculating all kinds of critical financial and cryptographic functions.
3
yup agreed, so far I have one `bench_results_faster_laptop.txt` I got from Calin haha, we should def. have a few to confirm results (and specify hardware used)
4
Correct.  For example the CHIP spec must specify exactly the range of integer operations and precisely the bit for bit operation and bit for bit results for all the finite number of arithmetic inputs including overflow indications.  (This can be done by quoting or referencing standards.)..There should also be a comprehensive test suite to verify the above, but it will need to be done in conjunction with implementers, since the brute force testing of all values would take more energy than in the entire universe. Different implementations and different hardware architectures may have different edge cases, so test cases will need to be revised from time to time.

Title: How people cash out crypto actually in Europe ? 
7
Check out xapo bank
3
Swissborg .Kraken..There’s a great service called Tap Global. They give you IBAN and you can sell them your crypto for cash then transfer to your legacy bank. Less likely your bank will see it’s crypto. ..Do it in smaller amounts. Don’t do one 80000 cash out. Do multiple 5000 ones
3
Use Kraken I guess, they are the most reliable for crypto-fiat in Europe. Most major entities use Kraken...Classify any gains in tax as capital gains or relevant, Kraken has an option to generate a tax return/filing detail statement for your country automatically ..The exchange itself just requires reason for the transaction and the amounts at most, at most they will call you and ask you to verify it personally, but if you’re like upto $100,000 it should be fine..And also, withdraw in chunks, not all at once unless you have a corporate bank account, and even if you do, consult a accountant and do a wire transfer.

Wow is Europe that strict? American here -- I have done $100k cashouts before (I am not rich -- this was a one-off).  What are the risks in Europe of larger cashouts? Genuinely curious.
3
Yeah but you need to pay tax on every transaction ?
1
I mean…there’s risks in USA also. One risk is that Coinbase will freeze your funds, happens often and there’s no chance you’re getting your money back if that happens usually. Most seem unaware of it bizarrely. ..In Europe banks are a bunch of assholes and will make your life difficult whenever they can. EU recently brought in some stupid rule, don’t ask me details…generally you want to keep any dealings you have in crypto as secret as possible. Sadly the trajectory is fir it to get worse and that’s why we need an on chain economy but that seems far away still 🫥
1
> One risk is that Coinbase will freeze your funds..I have never heard of this ever happening and I have friends that work at Coinbase. Will ask them but this sounds strange to me. In 11+ years of using Coinbase I can only say that ONE TIME a BCH deposit was delayed and they didn't "see" my BCH txn for like 6+ hours once (it had like 40 confirmations already).. and it was kind of exasperating during that time.

Title: How to buy onlh $10 of btc that can be sent to someone else's wallet address
0
Not that I do not believe you, but I am curious...> Everywhere I've seen requires a minimum of $30..Where have you seen this?..> I only want $10 to buy and send to a wallet address..Well, you'll need more than 10$. ..1) First there is the fee the vendor (exchange) will likely charge you. I haven't dealt with exchanges in many years but I remember it being more than a couple dollars. ..2) Then, if you're lucky, if you can send directly from the exchange to the address you want to send the 10$ to, you will have to pay a BTC network transaction fee. You will have to decide how quickly you want the transaction to complete. Next block transaction fees are, according to [BlockCypher](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/), around 4.68$ (I could have this wrong since the cost is 0.00008 BTC per KB and I have no idea how many bytes your transaction will be)..So... all in all 30$ doesn't seem all that outside of reality. This is what you get when you are using a broken bitcoin implementation.
6
BTC doesn't really work well as a currency and fees would make this transaction very expensive. You could probably do it with BSV using the Handcash wallet or even with BCH
3
At the moment a fee of 20 cents would be sufficient to get into the next few blocks on the BTC network. ..The main problem when sending from exchanges is that they often charge a high flat rate (eg >$30) per outgoing transaction independent of priority and value.

" if it ends without being funded, I will have to focus my energy elsewhere..."..Is this the "pay or I'm leaving" card you are playing? I suggest being grateful for what you have received so far instead...I've created 750 stories and 25 videos since 2021, around 90% of them are Bitcoin Cash-related...I never asked for a single satoshi from anyone, and definitely never attempted to extort the community in a way like this. I genuinely support Bitcoin Cash despite any differences in character I may have with a few people in it. The project and the idea matter, not the people. This is something many have not realized in the past and attempted to hijack BCH in various ways or showcase their displeasure for not getting as much (fiat money) as they wanted...Some turn against BCH after that, they attempt to create problems by posting nonsense on Twitter and try to create drama simply because they think they are worth many times more than what they actually do...Personally, as someone creating content for BCH I haven't received a donation or tip more than 0.015BCH for more than a year, and watching this behavior is irritating especially after you already got funded before with a large amount...I did receive lots of BCH in the past from tips though, and if we are to count the outcome it would be embarrassing to ask for even a single satoshi. Sometimes people will donate to my address or tip my posts, sometimes they won't. Tips definitely provide motivation, but I always explained it should be voluntary, and usually, just a comment and a like was more than enough to keep my channel and accounts growing. See, that's a long-term plan of supporting BCH and not a firecracker of some TikTok views that can easily be bought. ..Increase followers, increase views and reads, and have real stats to showcase and attract real people...Furthermore, it is obvious you did not realize yet what Bitcoin stands for, but apparently, the overwhelming majority in crypto today is also entirely missing the point...Regardless, I'd never say if you don't donate I'm gone. ..You are a mercenary - That's great for you.  Just know it is the effect of what you bring to the table that matters. What impact did you make so far? Was it worth 25BCH which right now stands for $8000 or perhaps what you propose is overvalued by 1000%?..Frankly, you put more effort into promoting your flipstarters than your BCH promotional activities...The point of all of this is to be grateful for whatever you got so far and either quit silently cause you were never interested or actually become interested and if possible be part of and enlarge the circular parallel economy that I am confident that at some point you will wish you had around you...To justify the amount you're asking for (especially considering previous payments), the value you've added to the network should be several times greater. Was it?

The only gaming sector where crypto is very popular in usage seems to be gambling games...I think crypto is not very popular with gamers and it will take a new, captivating game idea using crypto to popularize it...Or _maybe_ some gaming platform, new or existing, that starts to support buying games with crypto...But it looks like they'd rather deal with a lot of piracy than support economic models that bring them into conflict with the banking system.

I personally like the idea of NFTs being used for in-game ownership. Spells of Genesis is one of the first games I know of that actually succeeded in coming to market. Rarepepe was another attempt but last I know never actually released a game. Players can buy rarer more powerful weapons, armor, etc. The business benefits from the initial selling and players can benefit with a DEX style market. Maybe the business provides a market in-game and takes 1% or something.....You could also do NFT achievements....not sure if there is much value derived except a provable way to say one has achieved these things in your game....As for earning BCH, I'm curious how the business aspect works and staying solvent. Like reward users for playing but show advertisements to fund buying BCH? Also someone brought up gaming (cheating) the system, what if someone is able to farm your game? Would make staying solvent more difficult it would seem on the surface....Contracts are a great way to make provable agreements between players and the business too, incorporating contracts IMO will help build trust....Maybe integrating with other tokens could benefit the game too?

> Like you can buy or sell items for some BCH, killing enemies and such..That's a bad idea because it incentivizes cheating and botting.

There are several different versions around, you can Google. Depending on which sub you ask this question in, you may get different responses. ..Here's one that I like anyway, even though it's a few years old, it hasn't changed much:..https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/s/oQbGYFCVE6

Did you make this yourself?

This only shows the one hard forked split path, and it's poorly depicted at that. Also the terminology is often wrong. At best, it's misleading and biased.

"Bitcoin Core" is a node/reference client implementation, not the common name of a cryptocurrency.
-4
In this context, "Bitcoin Core" is a moniker for "not Bitcoin [Cash]". Using the name of the almost exclusive node implementation (not centralized though!?!) seems reasonable.
3
That's not how cryptocurrency names work. In fact, it could quite possibly be the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Is BCH called "Bitcoin Cash Node" now? Are cryptocurrencies constantly being renamed and rebranded whenever some magical usage threshold is passed? Are they now being named by their node implementations of all things? Hilarious...There is only one "context".  And this is far from "reasonable", obviously. It's a complete joke. ..As a result, it's blatantly obvious that this is just yet another biased hit piece. The unbiased open minded should avoid reading. I gave up as soon as I saw that part myself...Likewise, if I saw a graphic calling Bitcoin Cash some ridiculous narrative driven made up nonsensical name, I'd avoid that too. As the author is either biased or has no clue as to what they're even talking about. All bad.

You need to get out a bit more mate.

Ouch! Boy, you got me real good! A real zinger!..I didn't realize that you were in grade 3, my bad. Now your replies make much more sense.
1
I think if you get this worked up over a name on a diagram, especially one with a sound basis, you may want to reflect on why that is.
3
If this is what you call worked up I have to assume you're new to the whole internet thing. I couldn't be more zen...I'm merely pointing out an obvious truth, and, correcting and intentional error. ..Appreciate your deep concerns though.
1
LOL. You're replying within moments. Yeah, you're zen.
1
*LOL". I haven't been on in hours, that was luck. And what does replying within some predetermined time range of your specific choosing have to be with being zen or not? I guess you're not zen then too, not that that's how anything works. ..You're getting exponentially dumber by the second. You're scrambling to save face, but it's too late. I see we're done here.
1
A very zen response!
1
It is indeed. Now you're getting it.
1
Since you've been so entertaining, I'm curious as to why you got your panties in such a twist over "Bitcoin Core" on a diagram, but seem not to care about the other diagrams that use labels like "Bitcoin Legacy", "Dead End", "Bitcoin Segwit". I thought maybe some light may be shed on the topic by the diagram that you linked, but it seems you shared nothing more than a broken link.
1
Panties aren't in a twist, sorry. Yet again, just pointing out the obvious - the chart is blatantly incorrect and heavily biased. Big red flag, not to be trusted, awful source of information. People should be made aware. Sorry if that gets your panties in a twist, however. ..If someone actually used those terms under the guise that those are in fact the actual valid accepted common names used worldwide today to properly identify the cryptocurrency, then all the same things I've already said above also apply, of course. Those are not the common names of any cryptocurrency...Same as a BTC maxi graphic depicting "bcash". It's biased toxic garbage, no doubt full of misinformation. Avoid.
1
There's a lot of things in this thread that are plainly obvious; on that point I will agree. Sorry for getting you worked up. That was not my intention. Have a good one.

Not sure you've grasped the concept of "worked up". But ok then.

Isn't it astounding that after years of the mainstream predicting the death of Bitcoin, to the point of there being comedic obituary sites poking fun at the fiat personalities saying that, - now BTC'ers these days act the same towards Bitcoin Cash?..If I had to decide on a movie of which this reminds me, it would be _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_.

I paid about $0.30 in tx fees for the next block the other day to open another lightning channel...If you care about electric cash aspect, you should come back to Bitcoin. It has far more merchant adoption at this point. Go to a Bitcoin meetup and see for yourself. The HODL only cult mentality was an exaggerated stereotype we held.

Because they are trying to use the version that doesn’t work like cash.

Don't look to the state to provide for you with Bitcoin..Bitcoin wasn't supposed to be 'digital gold' that doesn't work as cash...Bitcoin was _supposed to be digital cash_ that is scarcer than gold...The less the state is involved, the more economic liberty you have as an individual.

The fork was 7+ years ago...People were free to trade between the pair, or not...People who are still regretting about trades back then, should consult a therapist and move on..._Bitcoin Cash_ has shown itself to be the worthy continuation of the [peer to peer cash system](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) that Satoshi invented.
22
No regrets. I still have some BTC because I like to hedge my bets. Theres no need to go all in on any coin. I have more BCH than BTC though because i want BCH to be p2p money for the world. BTC is practically just a corporate shitcoin now sadly.
6
Did you regret not trading your BTC to ETH or Dogecoin? Both overperformed BTC.

1. If your aim was *solely* to enrich yourself then one might have regrets. **I can understand your frustration**...2. If your aim was to aid in bringing about *[Permissionless P2P Money For The Whole World.](https://odysee.com/Permissionless-P2P-Money-For-The-Whole-World:2)* and believed in the  *Bitcoin Model* to accomplish it, **then probably not**, especially when you see current BTC Maxi's advocating for custodial solutions (hint Banking2.0)...Most are a mix of 1 & 2 (what's your mix? you can see mine ;-) )...**Do you regret not converting all your BTC for Solana when it came out?**

This guy? You mean you? You bet on the losing horse (eCash) and lost. No one forced you out. You could have stuck around helping us make P2P cash for the world but you thought the eCash way was THE way. Why did you give up on eCash? What made you change your mind about the viability of ecash?

Do you think it's BCH will eventually replace Bitcoin, or that BTC will eventually raise its block size?

Bad comparison. It's one thing to bet against the number one crypto as opposed to missing out on the next altcoin pump.

1. BTC is ahead of BCH on both counts. In the state of California where I'm from, there's far more Bitcoin meetups and merchants accepting lightning payments. In contrast, there hasn't been a single BCH meet up in my area for years..Check out BTCmap.org..2. It's one thing to not notice the next altcoin that does 10X. It's another thing to bet against the number one cryptocurrency with the highest market cap. It's like betting against the dealer.
-1
Except for that it has more adoption than BCH...Btcmap.org shows a whole bunch of places accepting lightning payments.
0
My position stated in the video is that all Bitcoin forks can only be testnets to Bitcoin. Bitcoin, if it's market share is rivaled, will have incentive to implement features of said fork. That being said, I still admire the software development direction of Bitcoin ABC. They also make a better testnet since they retain backwards compatibility with Bitcoin core.

Come on. Anyone who made that trade like I did got bamboozled whether they admit to it or not...>I dont consider BTC a crypto but a ponzi scheme..If so, who's at the top controlling the market then?.Tether?

People can use BTC, or they can use BCH, or they can use both...>  It's never too late to come back to Bitcoin...Whatever your definition of Bitcoin...For me it's the cryptocurrency that works as p2p electronic cash...> I've already learned my lesson and moved on...Your other comments in this thread suggest otherwise.
3
> BTC will eventually raise its block size..I don't think that will happen in a significant way. They are committed to their story of bad things happening if they do that so must avoid at all costs...> BCH will eventually replace Bitcoin..Don't know what will be first to replace BTC, but both it and BCH have the ticking clock of the halving. BCH (and in my view, Bitcoin), can only succeed if it gathers enough real economic adoption to sustain its network security. For this, of the two, only BCH has a chance. If not BCH, then maybe someday people will wake up and find out they need something like BCH, and reinvent the wheel.

How would btc increase block size cap without a hard fork? The community would split again creating bch2 and btc. I think bch2 would get less traction than when bitcoin increased its block size the first time. Edit: btc has made changes to the protocol that fits with a smaller block size. Btc has gone down the route of 'digital gold settlement layer'. a bch2 would have to revert these changes and start again where bch was in 2017.

BCH already replaced BTC. Thanks to raising the block limit. Isn't that obvious?

> BTC is ahead of BCH on both counts[.](https://archive.is/rYGLC#selection-2585.0-2585.35)..let's have a closer look at that,....* **1 - Self Enrichment:** ..   * If you DCA'd into both for the last 2 years BTC would have outperformed BCH by [~20% - 109% vs 92%](https://imgur.com/a/n0Vu4Xl) **and that's with the Blackrock BTC ETF tailwind** if self enrichment is what you are about then how do you think these numbers change with a BCH ETF? .   .   * But I will concede that over a longer period BTC has massively outperformed BCH, if Self Enrichment is ones guiding light. As I said I can understand your frustration.   .   * But remember to [Zoom Out](https://imgur.com/a/jDFT6bk) the vast majority of people who will use crypto have have no inkling that it is in their future...   * I assume the ultimate value will be in the coin that can actually '*Separate Money from State*' however long this takes (if it is possible!).   .  .* **2 - Permissionless p2p cash for the Whole World**...   * That's not so clear, you yourself used a [custodial solution - fedimint](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h10m00s) to receive Joe's tip in the video. Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins....   .   .   * Most BTC influencers admit to using Custodial LN, even NVK who is *very* technical is on the record as such.   .   .   * In order to be permissionless and self sovereign you have to own a UTXO, If you don't then all you have is an IOU from the person that does (eg. the custodians of your fedimint above) ..   * All known layer 2 solutions require an anchor into the base layer and this requires an on chain fee. Will the common man be able to compete with just the lowly Bitcoin Millionairs never mind Nation States, Fortune 500 companies or Michael Saylors for one of those ~300,000 tx's per day, **just to open their Lightning Channel?** Of course they won't bother and just use a Custodial solution - Bank of Coinbase, asking permission to transact, a CBDC in all but name..   .   .   * You say fees are only [$2 for next block](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h26m11s) **What will fees be in a Gold2.0 World?** Given that there are 64 Million millionaires in the World, those alone could transact about three times per year (overestimate as that's not including the 300 million businesses), all bidding for scarce blockspace..   * Do you think **even you with your ~1BTC, you would be able to compete for blockspace, never mind the 50% of Americans that cannot put their hands on $500 for an emergency.**.   .   ..BTC likely fails in 'Separating Money from State' due to the inevitable [face melting fees](https://youtu.be/ddIMjO1KB84?t=3377) forcing the masses into custodial solutions! **Guess who will be controlling those Custodial Solutions...** .......> In the state of California where I'm from, there's far more Bitcoin meetups and merchants accepting lightning payments. In contrast, there hasn't been a single BCH meet up in my area for years....No arguments there **price drives adoption** most people want to get rich. **Not to mention the long term anti BCH campaign that you are now wholeheartedly participating in...** Fortunately the BTC Maxi's influence is being diluted as we speak....But even with this *lack of interest*, BCH has seen steady growth over the last few years **has it turned a corner?**, remember exponentials start off slowly, 2 BCH conferences this year alone......Your older self knew that utility is important, your subconscious still does [you CURRENTLY keep BCH because your VPN provider Mulvad accepts it...](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h25m18s). **It's Just Money Bro!**...But yes the overriding utility is NGU for most (currently), perhaps that will change when they are told by their custodian of choice that 'they cannot spend their mad gainz with that retailer' as They are persona non grata, or they live in a prohibited jurisdiction. Or they decide they don't want to be surveiled using a CBDC in all but name.....> It's one thing to not notice the next altcoin that does 10X. It's another thing to bet against the number one cryptocurrency with the highest market cap. ..I and many here bet against the Big Daddy of currencies when I chose to go all in on Bitcoin. It's worked out well for me....And now I can support a project that I believe actually has a chance of being Money for the World....Keep in mind that you say you support the [UTXO model](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h37m58s)...Bitcoin cash already has all the improvements that BTC devs can only dream about here's bitcoincashautist on the subject..>> We're more than just a bigger block version of BTC, we've been busy during our 6 years of independence, here, catch up:.>>.>> BIP-62 malfixes, CSFS, cat&split, full flexible covenants through TX introspection opcodes (May '22), int64 ScripVM ops (May '22), unlimited unconfirmed chains, consensus-enforced native tokens (May '23, with dedicated set of introspection opcodes) that can interact with covenants, keep & pass around contract state, and make L1 DeFi happen. Also, getting adaptive blocksize limit in May '24. Look up "CashTokens"....Your hope for BTC is that it could add anything it needs but you neglect the fact that the people driving the 150x market cap of BTC over BCH **DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT** they actually have incentives to keep most of the World custodial as **they will be the custodians**...* **They also want hardest money possible to safeguard the Trillions that they will invest and the way to ensure that is to ossify the project ASAP**...Currently you cannot even get a simple counter to ~13000 into consensus (facilitating altcoin killing ;-) drivechains), A big test will be whether opcat etc gets deployed - I might rethink my outlook if this passes. Though I won't hold my breath....Without more scripting functionality 'Non Custodial World Scale' L2's would require another Satoshi Level breakthrough (probably still would)...I question your ability to understand the above just from your statement about [validation speed](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h15m21s)...You say you champion the UTXO model but don't seem to understand that with this model one can validate transactions **in parallel**..Then there's this **A raspberry Pi 4 can keep up with 256MB blocks**...The new Raspberry pi 5 has..* **48 times the cryptographic throughput**, one of the main bottlenecks on previous Pi's..* 2 times the memory bandwidth..* True gigabit ethernet..* Native pcie x1 up to 980MB/s on pcie3 nvme ssd (Haven't seen iops which prob matters for large UTXO set though should be **significantly** better than a pi4 using usb ssd)...Going out a bit further just an old M1 Macbook has many times the processing power of even a Pi5....**And I've not got onto transaction validation on a GPU, never mind actual signature checking ASIC's** so we are probably good even if Moore's Law stopped today....Also validation was discussed many times, you probably just didn't notice. Roger was likely aware of it but is too savvy a debater to bring it up and send the NGU contingent of the audience (who he was trying to reach) to sleep.......> It's like betting against the dealer....When you see that the dealer is just the same crooked Fiat dealer wearing a new coat it might be a good idea to opt out and bet against him....**Like many Maxi's before you, you have failed to grasp the central invention of Bitcoin - The ability to self custody, without which all the other properties can be undermined.**...The fact that you [considered supporting Ecash](https://youtu.be/KCF3mZW7hAM?t=00h28m31s) over Bitcoin Cash says a lot, for those who don't know Ecash had a built in Tax on every block that would be paid to the founder - Amaury Sechet. A master stroke! Though without Amaury we may not have had Bitcoin Cash, so thanks for that, just proving that anybody can loose their way, you will always be welcomed back ;-)..---------------------------------------------------------------------..[Unedited Original](https://archive.is/rYGLC#selection-2663.3-2660.3)

We're 15 years in, and it's a failed experiment so far. The internet, smart phones, email all were adopted within years, not decades...BCH has struggled for adoption, which is true. If you think lightning is a solution, then once again, it's a failed experiment. Lightning isn't scalable and violates the core self custody aspect of Bitcoin. Also, it's been 7 years of lightning, and it's barely growing...I've been in this industry long enough to know full well thar average people will not adopt something that is difficult let alone has 2 networks and one is for savings, the other for spending ... keep dreaming
2
> Bitcoin, if it's market share is rivaled, we'll have incentive to implement features of said fork....**Entities with Trillions on the line will be highly risk averse.**..The **current** value proposition for Bitcoin BTC is to be Gold2.0...Ultimately facilitating  Nation States, Pension/Hedge funds, Fortune 500 Companies etc to keep track of their liabilities to each other....As long as there are real World assets to be cannibalized into such an extremely hard asset with not seen before Global Liquidity....* **It will keep sucking in the worlds wealth <=> giving inflation/S&P500 beating $returns**...It doesn't need any new features to perform this function not even scalability beyond matching the Swift Network and 7tps + payment channels might be enough for that....I would suggest that those investors care far more about protecting the $Trillions they will invest than monkeying with the code and or scaling to a level where the common man can self custody....If you want any new features you had better get them in soon......I believe the above to be ultimately unstable because .it cannot Separate Money From State the large pools of Global liquidity will be custodial and hence regulated **by the State**.. .Any toppling of the above would be played out **slowly** over decades or more. How do you boil a frog?...Rather than risking the BTC Gold2.0 cash cow **why not just invest in any likely competitor.**
1
> If so, who's at the top controlling the market..You should really look into the likes of Blackrock, Vanguard, etc. and in turn, who owns them...These are who your 'institutional investors' who now carry BTC, depend on...The days of Tether are numbered, but the situation with BTC has not improved. It hasn't even reached $100K / coin, and the market cap is roughly 1/15th of real gold. AND it's now practically useless as a currency, it is not competitive with "fintech". Thanks Blockstream and those who supported this direction for BTC...> If BTC pops and crashes, then BCH will crash even harder...Now THIS is conjecture.
2
>  If BTC pops and crashes, then BCH will crash even harder...Quite probably, but then '*popping & crashing*' is not the only possible failure mode....I imagine a slow bleed out to be more likely, if it fails to fully Separate Money from State ultimately loosing out to one that can....Though in the interim I expect it to be wildly successful as it sucks in the Worlds wealth.

>Come on. Anyone who made that trade like I did got bamboozled whether they admit to it or not...I dont think we are involved in crypro for the same reason....>I dont consider BTC a crypto but a ponzi scheme..I do therefore it is of no interest to me...>If so, who’s at the top controlling the market then? Tether? They have less than 10% of Bitcoin’s market cap. If BTC pops and crashes, then BCH will crash even harder...You dont need a “leader” to have a ponzi scheme...you just need to have an investment where people exiting are paid out of people entering the scheme.

>nobody is going to pat you on the back here...Right, but I hope to challenge their views and have them engage with the arguments presented.
1
My argument of BCH never replacing Bitcoin and Bitcoin raising its block size has to do with incentives. .If another coin significantly rivals BTCs market share, it would incentivise bitcoiners to support a blocksize increase..To argue otherwise implies that bitcoiners would act against their interests when it's between winning and losing the number 1 spot in the #1 market.
1
Not. It's not even 1% of Bitcoin's market cap or network effect. So how has it "already replaced BTC" if it's only a small percentage as popular?
1
no?
0
>failed experiment ..By what standards?..>something that is difficult let alone has 2 networks..Do you know about submarine swaps? Wallets are getting better at seamlessly switching between LN and on-chain transactions.
1
That doesn't mean bitcoiners don't care about self-custody of their coins. .Also, they're keen on merchant adoption too with lightning as the number of merchants continues to grow. .Next block fees are currently around $2 which is negligible when you can make hundreds of transactions through one channel. ..But again, bitcoiners and in fact everyone are incentivized to act in their own self interest. .The BTC block size will eventually be raised to accommodate new exponential growth...But hey, at least you agree with me that BTC will remain the number one crypto in market cap.
0
> To argue otherwise implies that bitcoiners would act against their interests when it's between winning and losing the number 1 spot in the #1 market...Ethereum has already beat BTC in a number of metrics (except market cap)...Market cap is not everything, and latter-day BTC'ers trying desperately to convince the world that it is, is tragical comedy...In short, the recent years have already disproven your theory that the average BTC'er won't act against their own interests. They've done so time and again.
2
Oh, so by "replace" you meant popularity and market cap?    You mentioned block limit so I was under impression you know what is important in cryptocurrency and what Bitcoin was created for. Now I suspect you are just a clueless BTC maxi trying to stir drama about useless speculations and so on...Oh well...

BCH is just another scam fork of BTC. It made the original people billionaires while there's a small cult following trying to recover their losses and fomo other suckers in. I mean look at the sub they are in. It's not bitcoin or BCH. Literally btc. It's to entrap people and scam them out of their money. Sorry you fell victim to it =/

Don't assume. See the linked video. .There are unique arguments presented there that have not been talked about much..I used to be big time in Bitcoin Cash.

how did they make money off of bch? you had to have had btc to get bch. there was no IPO. this comment is plain simple incorrect.
4
> It made the original people billionaires..Surely you can name these 'billionaires' or else you are just a liar...> BCH is just another scam fork of BTC..There's no scam...BCH carries on the peer to peer electronic cash system...BTC decided to embark on being a store of value while leaving the medium of exchange part to other technologies...Good luck...p.s. I'll be waiting for you to list those 'billionaires', Distorted203.

> I mean look at the sub they are in...Comment that indicates you have precisely zero clue about the provenance of this sub, or you are happy lying. Either way, not a good look.
1
I mostly agree, but it's more of a failed project rather than an outright scam. Look at the BCH/BTC chart and market cap history. It also had a brain drain where a bunch of people left it for other projects like AVAX, BSV, ecash, etc. .As they say, the revolution eats itself.

You may be very surprised to hear how many things throughout history were created for one purpose, but adapted and evolved into others over time. And conversely, how many things that didn't adapt and evolve, died out. ..Nothing should be locked into one original idea forever. That'd be, just awful.

> this comment is plain simple incorrect...He lied...He doesn't even want to answer the challenges to his statement...It's actually known behavior of that account on this sub. It's an account that spreads misinformation about Bitcoin Cash.
3
Well for me, and many, it was essentially free money. I had BTC many years before the hard fork, and so I got BCH on fork day. Sold a significant amount of my new BCH, kept my BTC just the same . In the end, I simply made a substantial amount of money for doing absolutely nothing but selling the BCH I was forked. BTC unchanged...I assume they mean people like Roger Ver when they say original people. Who would've done far better than me, I imagine. People that were dropped a lot of free money that day.
2
Full quote in case of deletion:..> BCH is just another scam fork of BTC. It made the original people billionaires while there's a small cult following trying to recover their losses and fomo other suckers in. I mean look at the sub they are in. It's not bitcoin or BCH. Literally btc. It's to entrap people and scam them out of their money. Sorry you fell victim to it =/
2
You are absolutely right. Unfortunately, at the same time it is sad to see BTC being repurposed to be a speculation token and scam heaven. Oh well, anyway.
2
> It's actually known behavior of that account on this sub. It's an account that spreads misinformation about Bitcoin Cash...Seems to be multiple similar active accounts lately.

but thats then btc'ers making money off of bch. not other way around
1
Well, good for you sir. .I totally fell for the propaganda at the time. .Out of curiosity, why didn't the big block arguments convince you, and what gave you the wisdom to stay with Bitcoin?
-1
There are many ways to view the many sides of things. That is but one. A simplistic one at that.
0
Who said it was the other way around now? ..All the guy above said was that the creation of BCH made a bunch of people a lot of money. And it did. As I explained.
1
There were many reasons, and continue to be. But I kept some BCH, just in case. It was free afterall.
2
Yet that's simple and undeniable truth. BTC is otherwise completely useless and its development has been crippled to insignificant gimmick tweaking. You might see this differently, but reality doesn't care about and of you.
3
guy above said bch made the original people (in bch) billionares. while in actual fact the only people benefitting was btc'ers that dumped their bch. He was phrasing it asif bch was this scam where there is someone 'stealing' your money, getting rich off of it.
2
Conjecture coupled with absolute misinformation has always been a problem. Case in point.
-2
You read it wrong...Original people ARE the BTCers. People like Ver, who had a boatload of BTC, and so had extra incentive to create BCH, as it would only net him a shit ton of money from thin air. ..So BCH could be seen as a scam fork, for "original" people  to get free money. Their net worth went up a lot that day, for doing nothing.
2
>Conjecture coupled with absolute misinformation has always been a problem. Case in point....You think so? Or are you simply unable to face different views? Especially those that are so correct and uncomfortable for you. Yeah, case in point indeed.
2
wrong, Ver LOST money because he switched to bch.  He would have had a lot more money if he didnt do anything. So I ask again, how is bch a scam? no one made money from it? EDIT: also, Roger Ver did not fork BCH. He started supporting it later when it was clear btc would not raise block size cap.
2
I'm entirely unbiased. I understand and consider all sides, as stated above. You though, not so much, that's abundantly clear. Only the one. ..It's a lot bigger and more complicated an issue than you make it out to be.
0
You're missing the point. The actions AFTER the split are the onus of the individua. What Ver in particular did he, well, he chose to do - but he was up a lot of money instantly that day. Ver is just an example anyway. ..I'll write this out since it seems to be difficult: Let's say I have 1000 BTC. Then a minute later I have 1000 BTC and oh look also 1000 BCH. In that moment the total net value of my assets just jumped up. What I do in the weeks or months after is a whole different topic. But I just essentially made free money. ..I didn't claim it was a scam. I am just trying to explain what the other person wrote. They certainly did have incentive to create BCH though.
0
>I'm entirely unbiased...No, you are not...> I understand and consider all sides. ..No, you don't...>You though, not so much, that's abundantly clear...🤣..>It's a lot bigger and more complicated than you make it out to be...It is actually very simple and very easy. But you won't understand that anyway.
2
I still dont get your point. At the split, the ledger just duplicated and everyone had same amount of bch and btc. It's waaay better than any IPO and way more fair. Ok cool maybe he made a lot of money if you zoom in to a few specific days. He lost way more on other days. but besides the point why are we speaking about Roger ver in particular anyway. Theres whales that made money in btc also..  even more so because its up more since 2009 than what bch is up from 2009...Edit: that 1000 BCH in your example is not nescisarily worth anything if the market does not value it to be worth anything. So its not like making value out of 'thin air'...anyway the incentive to create bch was because it was clear that core was not going to increase the block size cap...The actions of a whale after the fact does not change that. Does Micheal sailor buying btc pushing up the price, make btc bad or a scam? Staying away from BCH because of Roger Ver is like staying away from BTC because of Michael Sailor.
1
>No, you are not...I do the best I can. I consider the pros and cons of all the various cryptocurrencies. And there are a lot, on both sides of that equation. For any cryptocurrency. ..You however are just regurgitating a single one sided dumbed down narrative.
2
No, Roger was an example, stop focusing on him. And again, this has nothing to do with what someone may or may not do AFTER the fork. I honestly don't understand why this is so hard to understand. You're missing everything I'm writing. Read it again, slowly? ..Here's another way to look at it. Say I have million dollars a worth of BTC. A minute later, the fork happens, and I instantly have say 1.2 million dollars worth, of BTC and BCH. I literally just made 200k overall, in an instant, without doing anything.  Again, what happens next is irrelevant, and not the point. I gained 200k, because of the fork. If I sold it right now, I get a free 200k.This is a clear incentive to want the fork. ..I can't dumb this down any more...? They had incentive, because they knew they would receive an instant net gain, for doing nothing.
1
>>No, you are not...>I do the best I can. ..That I can agree to. That's also why I'll give it a rest and spare you further humiliation.
1
I still dont get it. If that was true then I would just fork bitcoin every day and make infinite money. anyway we will just have to disagree on this. there was no net gain.
2
Yes indeed, being unbiased, being able to think and consider viewpoints, and having an actual understanding of all of the many positives and negatives across the crypto spectrum sure is humiliating! ..I'll stop researching with an open mind and start regurgitating one sided bullshit like you, that's clearly the best way forward. And so much less humiliating.
2
You can't, that's not how it works, if it was then of course it would happen - who doesn't want free money? But your forks would be worthless. Instead, BCH was a fork that had a lot of momentum and backing...There's nothing to disagree on, this is fact. It's so incredibly easy to see, and I've explained it it multiple ways, I can't fathom why you don't understand...I made a lot of free money that day, as my net total in dollar terms jumped way up. Fact. And I'm a small fish.
0
exactly my point. so the fact that the market valued both forks.. means the COMMUNITY was split. no value made out of thin air. Just people guessing which fork would prevail. so there was no value made out of thin air. Its actually very fair. Anyways, BCH will always be the first hard fork of bitcoin to fix its scaling problem by increasing the block size capacity. this is a fact that will always be true, and is the main reason that I am bullish on BCH.
2
You're provably wrong, as there factual was value made out of thin air, as it is anyway...I bought 1 million dollars of BTC an hour before the fork happened. When I sold shortly after the fork, I sold for 1.3 million dollars. I e., I made 300k, instantly, for doing nothing. This isn't difficult. And is a clear incentive for the people with lots of BTC to want BCH. It's an obvious free boost to their total dollar value.
0
I think you are confusing different factors. Basically you made money off of the turmoil of the split. The incentive for the split was definately not a cash grab. like I said its fine if we disagree. okay bye.
2
I'm not confusing anything, lol, apparently quite the opposite. I'm pointing out the easily provably fact that anyone with BTC made free and instant money in the instant of the fork. ..That is a fact. ..Free money is always an incentive, you're fooling yourself if you think otherwise. Some people made a lot of money that day. Many of whom couldn't care less about bigger blocks.

Title: Does the correlation between total BTC mined (linear), and the market price (log scale) imply there is an asymptote to the market price?
0
No, but common sense says that there is...More importantly, **every** consistently rising value can be correlated in some way to **every other** consistently rising value...The BTC price can also be correlated to the number of cell phones, so does that mean that the price will rise as long as people keep buying cell phones?
5
looks like they are both topping.
1
It just means both are related to time... More time more up...Mined goes up with time because... well, 10 minute blocks..Price goes up with time because... then you get into theories.
1
"What we have here is a failure to communicate."..Just some classic curve fitting, the price if it's affected by supply it is reversely correlated with supply. ..**There is no correlation, the dominant factor affecting price is the network affect, aka Metcalfe's Law.** ..There is another phenomenon that could take effect and that is Jevons paradox..Jevons paradox is an economic effect that names a phenomenon that as supply of a useful good increases in production, falling prices, demand increases as well. ..Price typically increases with inadequate supply or increasing demand, makes this seem like a paradox. ..BTC unlike Bitcoin, a P2P digital cash network, has little to no utility other than the native that it's a Store of Value, and **value being a subjective human preference cannot be stored**.  ..Bitcoin, on the other hand, is also subject to **Metcalfe's Law**, only it has utility in that it can be used as money. BTC with it's artificial transaction limit cannot be used as internet money.

You don't understand Bitcoin. If you knew even a little bit about it, you'd know BCH is Bitcoin. BTC is not. Look here: [bitcoinis.cash](http://bitcoinis.cash)

>If you knew even a little bit about it, you'd know BCH is Bitcoin...I know what you're trying to say, but there are MANY people who know "a little bit" about Bitcoin, but that little bit of knowledge hasn't exposed them to the differences between BCH and BTC. It takes quite a bit more research to understand where--and more importantly--WHY these implementations diverged.
5
Keeping telling people they don't understand something doesn't make it more interesting. As far as mass adoption is concerned it would appear ignorance is bliss...It's like telling people that ROC is China. They might have some understanding of the tribalism and history, but without explanation it's pointless.
3
Unpopular Opinion:  BCH is better, has been vindicated, but chose the worst time to split and miners errored some on the side of caution. No CAB board would approve a feature change in the middle of peak usage.  I often wonder where we'd be if they tried to split in 2018 instead of 2017.

Man this is so old and tired.

It says that BTC is not Bitcoin.
1
Don't fall for this line of B. S.. Check the respective hash rates for BTC and BCH and look at the charts. Clearly the people trying to convince you that Bitcoin is BCH are scammers. Many sold all their Bitcoin at the fork to buy more BCH and are now down 99%. What they really mean to say is "I believe BCH is more true to the original intent of Satoshi" which is debatable. But trying to convince new users looking for Bitcoin, the one on the news, that is legal tender in El Salvador, that has many ETFs all over the world etc. that BCH is that Bitcoin is a pure scam. They don't argue in good faith. They attempt to trick people, which is what makes it the worst type of shitcoin. Masquerading as "the real Bitcoin" is not a good faith approach and very likely is why it's worth so little relative to BTC and even compared to other shitcoins...edit: phone typos.

> As far as mass adoption is concerned it would appear ignorance is bliss..Not really. Ignorance cannot make the technical realities magically vanish.

Welp. Stick with BTC then. This is not exactly a message intended for the ignorant.

It was Blockstream that hijacked BTC and started forking away from Bitcoin.   .Bitcoin was FORCED to fork into BCH first, otherwise the Bitcoin chain would have been poisoned with SegWit.

> [BCH] chose the worst time to split..> No CAB board would approve a feature change in the middle of peak usage..Why didn't _you_ raise the BTC blocksize before it got all congested - again?..And what have you done since to alleviate the problem?

I'm kinda curious; how did you end up on this sub. In this post?

Clearly, Bitcoin is not for you.
1
I'm not commenting on what the ad says.  I'm commenting on *your* comment:."You don't understand Bitcoin. If you knew even a little bit about it, you'd know BCH is Bitcoin."..It's extremely common for people to know "even a little bit" about Bitcoin but not know "BCH is Bitcoin".
7
It's exactly the ignorant who BCH should be reaching!..The informed already know...
3
No one forced BCH to fork.  The issues with Bitcoin at the time were concerning and unfortunate, but they could have been worked out in time if the community stuck together and worked through it.  ..Even if the small-block narrative was seeded by central-bankers via Blockstream, there were and are thousands of highly intelligent small-blockers who still stand by the decisions of the time.  People in this sub completely ignore and mock them.  You act like anyone in BTC is just an ignorant lemming.  Yet, I personally know dozens of BTCers who have read Roger's book, truly understand the arguments, and have not become BCH supporters...If you hadn't hard forked, maybe there would be more balance in the community, and the "hijacking" could have eventually been undone, over time.
-1
Boy ive been a part of this sub since before bch, and watched the whole argument come and go, and watched bitcoin cash come into its own as a unique offering that stands on its own without trying to co-opt the actual btc ticker...Bch is fine, but its NOT bitcoin. Its just not, and never will be, and its silly to keep arguing that it is. ..Allow BCH to stand on its own. ..At this point the only people still pushing this broken records are weirdos like you, the rest of the internet moved on from this fight.
2
BTC and BCH both have a use, but its stupid to keep trying to redefine a word this long after the fact...BTC is bitcoin. BCH is bitcoin cash, and theres nothing wrong with that. Accept its place in the crypto world and move on. Tell everyone that bitcoin is shit and only to use bitcoin cash, i dont care. ..This whole debate is so fucking old and tired, everyone except a few weirdos like you have moved on to recommending bch on its own merits, not because "hur dur, its the real bitcoin"
2
You are right. It was a rude reply.
7
Even the ignorant get that BTC is not Bitcoin from this.
3
It's bullshit and you know it. The intention was to sabotage Bitcoin from the start...What do you think Blockstream used the $76 million in venture capital from the 2014-2015 series A funding round for? (more than $300M after round B)..Do you seriously think AXA/Mastercard, Bitfinex(tether), and undoubtedly some shady federal reserve and CIA funded venture firms piled all this money into BTC because they were eager for Bitcoin to succeed and wipe them all out in the end?  XD..It sure as hell wasn't for development either. You think the SegWit hack costed $300M?  .It was for bribes, censorship, pay-offs, astroturfing and shaping a false narrative to facilitate the takeover and neuter BTC. They couldn't outright kill it, you see...If Bitcoin hadn't forked to BCH, Bitcoin wouldn't have survived.
8
You must have closed your eyes for a bit there then; because if you actually were there; you'd know BTC is not Bitcoin. Not even close...You're also utterly missing the point. The fight is not "for" or "against" BTC. We are in war with CBDC's, central banking and a government driven economy. ..Blockstream set back adoption of crypto for at least a decade with their crap, and yes, I think the separation of money and state is worth fighting for.   .The weirdos are the ones who don't recognize a paradigm shifting invention when they are presented with one, and instead choose to rape it to death driven by bankster propaganda. Yep; That's you.
7
BTC has absolutely no use. I stopped reading there.
2
Let's hope so...BTW, I think the graphic would work better if 'Blockstream' was also colored orange, being the BTC-maximalists they like to appear
1
And if BCH actually started to become a real threat, they'll find a way to do the same shady shit again to it.  You can't keep running from it, and dividing the community into ever more fragmented pieces.  Especially once institutions have gotten involved (which is inevitable and shouldn't be seen as a hijacking)..Look, I get your point, and I agree with you.  I'm not 100% certain that the fork should not have happened, maybe it was the right move.  But we have hindsight now that so many years have gone by... and with this hindsight, I think it's clear that the fork did more harm than good, even though the intentions were good.  I think some of the "hijacking" damage could have been undone by now.  I think we would have had a better shot at making Bitcoin a tool for freedom if we had stayed together and not forked, even though the fight would have been difficult...There will always be enemies trying to take us down.  There will always be people we disagree with.  The worst thing possible is community division, even if our reasons are good.  I believe the fork shouldn't have happened, and now we're all worse off for it.

Then tell everyone to stop using btc, thats fine. im not defending btc or blockstream, but to say bch is bitcoin is just factually wrong and disingenuous...Say bch is the more true bitcoin implementation, but is it Bitcoin with the captial B that the world knows? No. Objectively, it is not. There is no debate...Say bitcoin is worthless due to corruption from blockstream. I wouldnt go THAT far myself, but youre welcome to. Say the bitcoin project has deviated from its intended goal, say whatever you want, but dont throw out an objective lie, bitcoin is btc, and bitcoin cash is bch...Sometimes projects fork off to bring the focus back to the original intention, but that doesnt mean that that can just retroactively take the name of the older implentation. If I forked gitlab and removed all the dev ops bullshit and refoccused it to a code hosting platform only because thats the way i interpreted the original project mission, I cant just say my new gitlab cash project is the real gitlab. Even if the original gitlab project was taken over by malicious actors and changed, its still the gitlab project...Its literally just self delusion to thinkt he way you are after all this time...Bitcoin cash has grown to be its own product, allow it to stand on its own. If blockstream fucked the bitcoin project up so bad, why is there this crazy desire to still be associated with something so corrupt as bitcoin?
1
And thats why its foolish to attempt ~~reasoning~~ discussion with people like you...Objectively, bitcoin is an absolutely great store of value. I think its lost most of its use as p2p cash, but thats just an evolution of the technology and product. You can argue that is good or bad, but it doesnt matter...Bitcoin cash serves an entirely different purpose...✌️
2
Yeah, I'll try that. Thanks for the input.
3
> and now we're all worse off for it..I'm sitting here using Bitcoin how it was intended to be used. I can send it to anyone, anywhere, for less than $0.01 a transaction. I'm not feeling like things are worse in that sense...What is worse is that most people are too ignorant or too busy to do more than 5 mins of research and will likely never realize that what they buy today as "bitcoin" is not the original bitcoin as determined by the way it functions. It's bitcoin in name only.
5
RBF and SegWit made BTC unusable and are irreversible. Bitcoin is battle-hardened now though, and it doesn't have a centralized dev team like Blockstream's BTC Core. Bitcoin actually really is unkillable. BTC is very dead though; has been for some time...The bank funded Blockstream fuckers gave the banks the time to come up with CBDC's and stricter KYC though, so yes, we're all worse off for it. Nitwit.
3
Blockstream saying "I made this", doesn't make it Bitcoin. There indeed is no debate.  .Bitcoin Cash will be known as just Bitcoin again, The narrative is already slowly shifting but I don't think you noticed because it seems there is a lot more you are not aware of.
4
Bitcoin is the idea of a system described in the document "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", which does not correspond to the implementation that you call bitcoin (BTC). I.e., you are not living in reality; a delusion.
4
Bitcoin**: a peer2peer electronic cash system.**  .BTC is a fucking ponzi. It "lost all of its use as global p2p cash". It has NO value...Snap out of it.
4
That's all just a narrative you've been convinced to believe in.  Ultimately, you're using Bitcoin-Cash how it was intended to be used, and you're not using Bitcoin at all.
0
Naw man.  You're so deep into your own narrative bubble that you can't even think clearly.  This is a complicated and nuanced topic, with intelligent people on both sides.  ..You're acting like a cultist, thinking you've got all the answers.  I discuss this with BTCers often and get the same kind of arrogant cult-like responses.  I wish there was someone who understood both sides and could have a balanced discussion without all the conspiracy theories and narrative brainwashing.
2
argue the implementation sucks and shouldnt have deviated, fine. ..argue that bch is a better implementation, fine...argue any one of a million other things, fine. But when you start to argue for an objectively false claim, that bch is Bitcoin, then youre going to lose a lot of people.
3
no, little b bitcoin is "the idea of a system described in the document "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"..Bitcoin with a capital is a product of the Bitcoin org..These are two distinct things, the "bitcoin ideal" and the "Bitcoin project". ..Which is why its fine to say that bch is a better bitcoin implementation, but it is not Bitcoin, and never will be. Thats why its called Bitcoin Cash already. It literally already has its own distinct project name and ticker.

**Bitcoin***: "Bitcoin* is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money"..[https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#what-is-bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#what-is-bitcoin)..Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent [triple entry bookkeeping system](http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html) in existence...---..None of that is false. You can send money directly from your wallet to another users wallet. Does it do it well anymore? In my opinion, no. Just because a product does its job badly, doesnt mean you just get to say your version that you like better is the real one. Plenty of projects come after the initial one has deviated from its initial stated goal, but those projects are distinct entities, and it takes someone intentionally being dense not to see that...Again, projects change man. Have you never seen a company go in a new direction? Bitcoin is a organization, and a product. The "bitcoin ideal" is distinct from the organization, and the company. ..Bitcoin exists as the organization chooses to define it. They could drop the cash concept today and but it into a new smart contract system, and it would still be Bitcoin...This is foolish, and youve shown that you are choosing to be dense and tribalistic. I dont have anything else to say to a fool like you.

It's an idea...Like Democracy...Democracy isn't the US either.

Youŕe not living in reality, sorry. If 99% of people "identify" a woman as a man, it doesn´t make it reality...To call BTC "Bitcoin" is akin to paying royalty fees on a patent for a system that you don´t even incorporate.

If soft-forks can be done, they can be undone with another soft-fork...*"centralized dev team like Blockstream's BTC Core"*..Not a fact.  That's not how open source development works.  Sure, there appeared to be some conflicts of interest.... but jumping to the "centralized dev team" narrative is just total BS.  It's nuanced...“What do you think Blockstream used the $76 million in venture capital from the 2014-2015 series A funding round for? (more than $300M after round B)..*Do you seriously think AXA/Mastercard, Bitfinex(tether), and undoubtedly some shady federal reserve and CIA funded venture firms piled all this money into BTC because they were eager for Bitcoin to succeed and wipe them all out in the end”*..Not facts.  Lots of conspiracy and anecdote.  I happen to agree with you, and I believe Bitcoin was hijacked somewhat in this manner.  But I’m not brainwashed enough to not admit that I don’t know 100%, and I sure as shit am not gonna go fork a new chain just cuz we get a little nefarious interference...*“It was Blockstream that hijacked BTC and started forking away from Bitcoin.”*..Not a fact.  Thousands of people supported what they were doing.  They never once supported or created a hard-fork at any point.

because Bitcoin is its own org and product, separate from the bitcoin ideal you are discussing put forth in the whitepaper. ..Is that a good thing? irrelevant. its fact. ..Bitcoin can be whatever the Bitcoin org wants it to be, because they are in control. ..Bitcoin Cash is a separate implementation of bitcoin created to bring the focus back to the whitepaper, and is not Bitcoin, because it is Bitcoin Cash...Bitcoin is what it is, and Bitcoin Cash is what it is. I have nothing against bch, and in fact I believe it can stand on its own as a potentially superior product to Bitcoin, and its stupid that people wont let it, instead trying to ride the coattails of something that came before.
1
And thats where your ideals deviate from reality...Bitcoin is a product of the Bitcoin org, and they can do as they wish. This is the reality of the world. You disagreeing that they should be able to do this, is just that, you disagreeing. Changes nothing...Keep fighting for the ideal bitcoin (bitcoin cash), and let Bitcoin fall away and die if this is how you feel, but Bitcoin Cash is not and never will be Bitcoin, and its amusing to see you guys arguing about it so many years later.

Come back when you have something to bring to the table. You are only showing your ignorance now.
1
You're completely right.  Even Roger was intelligent enough to say the same in his book.  He admits that it's unfortunate, but true, BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin-Cash...People in this sub want to ignore it and create their own narratives and live in their own bubbles.  Exactly what they accuse the BTCers of doing.
2
> Bitcoin is a product of the Bitcoin org..On the contrary, it's amusing to see you try to propagate this brand ownership myth...Bitcoin doesn't belong to anyone. No-one is going to appropriate it...Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash, and yet it's still Bitcoin...Yes, in capitals. Not 'bitcoin cash', it's Bitcoin Cash.

What point do you think you're making here?  ..Even Scientologists can connect dots to create narratives and convince people of their bullshit.  ..Conspiracy theories are everywhere, but that doesn't mean we should believe them all.

I'm not trying to "bring something to the table".  I'm trying to get as close to the truth as I can, and I believe humble discourse is the way to do that.  I'm challenging you because criticism is the best way to determine the truth of a proposition.  I agree with most of your points, but I also think you're conspiratorial and convinced of a narrative which may not actually be as true as you think it is...Edit:  I say these same things to BTCers all the time, and I challenge them in a similar manner.  I'm trying to cut through the narrative and the conspiracy, and get to the actual truth.  This is a tough subject, because both sides appear to have good reasons and sound logic.  Yet, the individuals on both sides seem to act like it's so obvious that they have the truth and the other side are just dummies

Thank you. People are weird about things, sometimes even when its disadvantageous to their cause...5+ years ago it was a silly argument, but these days its just sad.

Title: 🫡 Bitcoin Archive pays tribute to Hal Finney by supplementing his post each year about "bitcoin is up and running" with posts about bitcoin still working.

Bitcoin is still working as the Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi envisioned and described in his white paper. Satoshi’s original creation lives on under the name “Bitcoin Cash” and the symbol BCH.  ..Satoshi’s original creation does not live on under the name “Bitcoin” (BTC). This fork of the original block chain is now being billed as a “store of value” by its developers. It no longer serves the function of Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Unfortunately, Hal Finney is no longer around to confirm this.

There is lots of evidence that it's Hal Finney. He's probably the most common suspect.

It has the name of the company that runs the exchange, but that will not prove where the BTC went after that.

It's using FundMe.cash.  You can donate with any wallet that can connect via WalletConnect.  If you need to do that, I recommend [cashonize.com](https://cashonize.com/), send in any funds you want to that wallet and then connect up to FundMe and contribute...This is the replacement for / next iteration of Flipstarter basically.  I know it might be a little strange or unintuitive if you haven't used it before, but it's much easier than using the Flipstarter Electron Cash plugin for new users.  And it'll get even easier as Wallet Connect (and soon CashConnect, the even better WalletConnect) support rolls out into more wallets.

-2
Yes, no one would contest that. If you use Tor via exit nodes instead of staying within the .onion system you will be traced back.
-2
> What do you think is Signal collecting on their AWS servers?..OK, any further info confirming this?..The client is open source, it would be hard to hide it.
3
What are THEY hiding from us man?!!? HOLY SHIT.
1
The client is most likely solid. That's why agencies try to get access to your phone before E2EE which means if you are not running GrapheneOS for mobile or Linux for your desktop you or your message partenr are vulnerable (applies likewise to SimpleX and Session)...Metadata is incredibly rich. It tells you your location. Your social graph. When your write to whom. Your phone number means you are KYC'ed. And even if you used a burner phone number or created an account without number you now need to login over Tor to not create an easily tagable profile...Read up on SimpleX. What they do different to understand what is wrong about Signal. That said: For private communication I would use Signal over WhatsApp or Telegram any day. I just don't trust is as I don't have access to the servers. ..And ISPs and AWS (assuming they are tracking for agencies) can see a lot  (location, IP, package size) even if Signal claims that they can't see anything other than account creation and connections with the server...If normies delete WhatsApp and Telegram and instead move to Signal that is a big step forward. But for people in the space it is not nearly enough...u/epoberezkin I guess you have more insights into Signal than most of us....In short use GrapheneOS, use always on Tor, use SimpleX (but in that scenario if you signed up with Signal with a burner phone and created a new account not connected to a phone number you are likely phine. But with everything "privacy" that question is who does this? And the answer is almost nobody which endangers those who don't and those who do likewise.

> The client is most likely solid. That's why agencies try to get access to your phone before E2EE which means if you are not running GrapheneOS for mobile or Linux for your desktop you or your message partenr are vulnerable (applies likewise to SimpleX and Session)...OK I get it...This is solvable then, just get a burner phone with anon sim......or just use Session/Simplex, which at this point seems to be superior because of this Signal limitation.

Title: BTC and BCH transfers: a case study
22
BTC has a replace by fee(RBF) option so that means while sitting in the mempool a tx could be replaced by a newer transaction with a higher fee, so transactions in the mempool aren't guaranteed and merchants will wait for confirmations before releasing funds or purchase items. ..BCH doesn't have RBF, so transactions entered into the mempool are guaranteed to eventually confirm, we call this zero-confirmations or 0-config. This means for small purchases, i.e. coffee, lunch, groceries, Amazon purchases, etc. merchants can feel comfortable to send or release funds or items instantly. ..This aligns with what Satoshi set out to do, create a "digital cash system", title of the white paper. BCH is superior as a digital cash system to BTC...But also realize keeping all your BCH in cold storage does BCH no favors. That's why it's best to keep at least some in a hot wallet, Spend and replace, and grow the economy. ..Places to spend BCH:..https://www.bitgree.com/ - for Amazon purchases. ..https://www.keys4coins.com/ - for gaming purchases..https://map.bitcoin.com/ - brick and mortar businesses
14
Now let both funds sit for 1, 2 or 5 year and compare the purchasing power, would be an interesting one
2
BCH, as it is, has faster and cheaper transactions than BTC. We all know this, you didn't come up with some groundbreaking discovery, and it hardly needs some so-called "case study"(?) . I mean, it's just bigger blocks on a barely used network, the outcome is a given. ..Of course, if speed and low fees are all you're truly after, there are even faster and cheaper alternatives, both crypto related and even traditionally. Hell, I can also fork you a dozen more big blocked unused chains in a few minutes, too. But there is no demand - the whole "crypto as cash" thing isn't a use case the general population even wants, it's full of very significant issues and problems. BCH does not solve a problem for most of us, it typically just makes the problem much worse. ..Instead, some want the very important higher security aspect, when it comes to their valued assets. Some perhaps the increased liquidity, for their larger investments. Global large scale brand name recognition, actual transaction volume/usage, support by large institutions and countries, a thriving active ecosystem, a continually evolving with the times motivation and vision, etc etc etc. There's a lot going on...There are many reasons the world chose BTC as Bitcoin. Not the ones you'll hear about here, as this is a one sided sub. You can Google this and find a plethora of articles yourself. This has come up a million times already. In the end, use whatever you may prefer for whatever reason you may want. ..The trends will (and do) speak for themselevs.

thanks for the reply. just to make sure I understand, are you saying RBF is an advantage of BTC? ...I could see advantage if I needed to have my transaction clear fast(er). But my BCH transaction cleared in less than a minute, was that unusual or will I run into situations where my BCH transactions hang unconfirmed for a long time?
2
> are guaranteed to eventually confirm..Unless the blocks are consistently full for two weeks (which is unlikely as BCH has less usage and higher block size caps, but still) or a double spend is performed.
1
Depends on what you want to achieve...If the value aspect is the only interesting part, sure. However, most of the OG:s were into Bitcoin to replace the central banking system, by avoiding to use fiat currency all together. In that case BTC is a bad candidate, as the transaction capacity is nowhere near enough to allow the network to grow. BCH could probably handle 1-2GB blocks with the current implementations and hardware. That is 3 orders of magnitude more than BTC. With dynamic block sizes now activated, BCH can scale to world wide adoption, assuming scalability issues will be addressed going from 1GB to 1TB (which is basically world wide adoption).

>are you saying RBF is an advantage of BTC? ..No it's not an advantage, it destroys BTC being useful as cash. .. >will I run into situations where my BCH transactions hang unconfirmed for a long time?..Only real case that might inconvenience people is taking coins off an exchange, but this goes for all crypto. Exchanges will wait for a predetermined number of confirmations before they will release funds. I think many exchanges wait for too long, about 12+ confirmations which can be a couple hours or more.

Is BSV or BCHSV allowed? I didn't quite get the point. Is anyone claiming BTC is faster or cheaper than BCH?

how do you understand this practically? is it as simple as the fact that it would take significantly less computing power to do a 51% attack on BCH?
5
Not everyone needs to store the whole chain...Pruned nodes have been a thing for a long time, and software technology allows for nodes to distribute blocks among themselves so even fewer archival nodes are needed. The efficiency of such distributed nodes storage would be such that 100 nodes could each store just a little over 1/100th of the blocks. Or a 1000 thousands, each storing a little over 1/1000th of the block data. It scales well...None of this requires consensus changes.

you didn't get the point? I did two transactions with two bitcoin implementations where one came out as a clear winner and asked what am I missing about the value of the other one. someone here responded with a great point about fee replacement in BTC that doesnt exist on BCH. what are you on about dude? 
5
> Is BSV or BCHSV allowed?..No, those are bullshit...Built coin confiscation into the protocol. And put their development behind proprietary license. It's centralized, corporate...Not Bitcoin anymore.
3
All you have to remember is if it were easy it would have already happened until the chain was destroyed. ..Perfect is the enemy of good.
8
The way I understand it is that BTC is 600x more resistant to censorship. It also attracts bigger funds/investments as it inspires more confidence and adoption knowing that it cannot be attacked. I feel safer to hold it for the long term knowing that it's the most secure network on the planet. It also means that governments can't shut down the network as easily, as it's more global and decentralised.
-1
Pruned nodes inevitably lead to more centralization and reduces the network's integrity. .Bitcoin is about inclusivity, anyone with modest resources can participate in the network, that's how it should be. .Also, your argument that it wouldn't require ANY consensus changes is simply wrong, as it would require changes on how the nodes communicate, otherwise it could lead to forks or even fragmentations within the network, as some nodes would accept the change, while others wouldn't.
1
Anytime someone brings up a good point about BCH in this sub. We magically get some random account, talking about bank notes, XLM, XRP, or whatever as a way to derail the conversation about BCH's usefulness...I can only assume these are troll accounts, as they don't argue in good faith, best to just ignore them.

How bout Dogecoin or Litecoin?
0
I think it's a valid point but if the only thing that gives BTC this advantage is its size I think ultimately a digital currency with more use cases and utility can displace it. (Not saying that's BCH but it feels like it?)
3
> your argument that it wouldn't require ANY consensus changes is simply wrong, as it would require changes on how the nodes communicate..That's not a consensus change. Learn the difference.
2
That's honestly how I took it. I see it as trying to create a viewpoint that there's only 1 "proper" bitcoin implementation and everything else is a shit altcoin.
2
I think they do that because if the argument is that "cheaper and faster are what matter most", then there are better options than BCH even.  It's pointing out the hypocrisy in BCH supporters to be against BTC for those reasons.  Why not move to the "fastest, cheapest" blockchain every time a new one comes out (so like, daily), if digital cash is truly your goal?
0
Dogecoin : Inflationary. Not Bitcoin. Also, can't seem to decide what it wants to be...Litecoin:  Started new chain with new genesis block, different hashing algorithm and 4x supply. Close to Bitcoin, but obviously not Bitcoin. Technically better though than BTC.
2
You're on point. If the number go up narrative fails (and eventually it will), the network effect will vanish (except for when everyone is running for the exit).
6
Yes valid points, however you haven’t gotten to the root of the matter, BCH and BTC split at the same time, you need to deeply understand the reasons why one has outgrown the other by 600x!..Millions of people know something you don’t, potentially.
0
You're telling me to learn the difference lmfao, but it's simply not true. How nodes process and validate transactions or how scripts are processed WOULD require consensus changes
1
Use RES, and start tagging people. You will have an easier time navigating the waters around here.
2
There much more to the tech than just cheapest and fastest. Both BCH and BTC are PoW chains, BCH shares the same mining algorithm as BTC and many of the same miners...But Op is specifically talking about BTC vs BCH so it's even more disingenuous to bring up other coins in this thread. So don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining.
3
Any idiot can fork a new "Bitcoin", no magic there. But why does it have to be "Bitcoin" anyway - They are talking about fast and cheap transactions in this thread. There are far better solutions available.
0
I am trying! What is it besides first mover advantage!?
1
That's not the same as how nodes exchange data about incoming transactions and blocks, which isn't relevant to consensus...The word 'process' is doing too much heavy lifting in your comment...> You're telling me to learn the difference lmfao, but it's simply not true..It is, one day you might get it.
2
If BTC would have been renamed to something else, and BCH would have kept the BTC name I would suspect that BTC (BCH) would now be >> 600x. It is just how powerful a brand is. Most people do not understand the details underneath. BTC is no longer adhering to the basic principles of peer-to-peer cash, and openly so. It does not matter, unfortunately. Propaganda and branding works.. also unfortunately.
5
Doubt it’s just about branding. ..BTC has different properties. The market might value those above BCH. It is valuing those above BHC...Cheaper to run nodes..Easier to decentralise..Harder to shut down..etc.
2
> Doubt it’s just about branding...I guess we'll have to disagree on this point...> BTC has different properties. The market might value those above BCH. It is valuing those above BHC...I would like to understand this, but I fail to find any compelling arguments for this...> Cheaper to run nodes..Not really. The improvements made to BCH protocol and implementations allow nodes to run cheap even with bigger blocks...> Easier to decentralise..Due to the previous point?..> Harder to shut down..Hash rate? More decentralised development? Why is it harder to shut down? Because of the brand?
3
Hash rate and more decentralized development are a large of it, yes.  I know most people in this sub strongly disagree that BTC has "more decentralized development", but I strongly disagree with them.
1
BCH has the [CHIP](https://gitlab.com/im_uname/cash-improvement-proposals/-/blob/master/CHIPs.md) process, to agree on consensus changes. BTC seems to not have a similar process. On what basis do you disagree?

Great to have this conversation with you. As written on Nostr, I believe the age of the CEOs is dawning as the centralized model is corrupted beyond repair.

They can't. Maybe they intend to issue paper that can be redeemed in btc and 2nd layer networks (where they good ole boys reap the rewards) because its not adequate for commerce... and repeat the entire bait ans switch fiat scheme again which achieves nothing in the end for THE people...Or just use bitcoin cash. It's a house of cards on the BTC in my ignorant opinion until BTC implements what bitcoin cash already does. It has no utility compared to BCH.
16
You should ask this same question in r/bitcoin for shits and giggles.
8
The reason they don't intend to use it is because it has already failed as a medium of exchange, because any merchant contemplating accepting it would have to be concerned with every person who's hands it has ever passed through due to kyc and aml regulations (and the fact that every tiny piece is tracked and traced), so they want nothing to do with it. This is why the bitcoin maxi's have pivoted to calling it a store of value instead, because you don't find out the same problem there until later down the road when it's too late.

It is not replacing Fiat money and its not meant to. Its a answer to the issues of Fiat money. What is potentialy replacing it are the cryptocurrencys, while BTC is the store of value, 3k+ cryptos are replacing Fiat at ease...
1
They will implement A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital currency issued by a country's central bank, as opposed to a commercial bank. CBDCs are similar to cryptocurrencies, but their value is fixed by the central bank and is equal to the country's fiat currency. CBDCs are intended to complement cash, not replace it. In a CBDC world, the digital code for each virtual currency unit would be stored in a digital wallet and could be easily transferred to other people's digital wallets. .As of November 2023, more than 100 countries were exploring CBDCs, with central bankers in Brazil, China, the euro area, India, and the United Kingdom leading the way. The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have already introduced CBDCs, and 19 of the Group of 20 (G20) countries are in the advanced stages of development. However, as of June 2024, the US Federal Reserve had not yet decided to transition to a CBDC and was instead researching its potential effects on the dollar, the US, and the global economy. .Some concerns about CBDCs include: .Privacy and surveillance.Critics worry that a government-issued digital currency could lead to increased surveillance and control over financial transactions. .Security risks.A UK House of Lords economic affairs committee report concluded that a CBDC could be vulnerable to cybersecurity weaknesses that could compromise individual accounts, and that a centralized CBDC ledger could be a target for attack from "hostile state and non-state actors"

I don't pay attention to r/bitcoin anymore because most of the people are less technically inclined in addition to being wrong on narratives. I see a lot of maxis on nostr who are more deeply familiar with the latest developments. they have been focusing on technologies like fedimints and chaumian ecash. these are basically banks that exist on top of lightning and it's impossible to interact with them without relying on an entity that can rug you. then there's also that aqua wallet thing, which is basically a liquid sidechain wallet stapled to a lightning bridge. liquid is about as bad as an ecash mint...the engineers are coming up with a new narrative that basically normal people in a mass adoption scenario cannot be expected to use self-custodial bitcoin correctly, so there is no point in working on anything at all that would make self-custody accessible to a greater number of people. they have already decided to just throw self-custody out the window. they are happy to force 99% of bitcoin users into ecash mints and IOU sidechains where self-custody doesn't really exist. at least with ETH L2 developers there is a desire to make rollups more sovereign and to make self-custody more accessible. BTC L2 devs don't care anymore. they will just laugh you out of the room and insist that it's a waste of time.

So how exactly do any other cryptos differ from fiat besides being fully digital🤔
2
And still it was somewhat the origin, and then we had a nice idea by backing more transportable and verifiably money (paper money) with gold, so when you were paying your bills with dollars back then, it was the equivalent of paying with gold, now it's not anymore and the whole financing world is constantly collapsing and crippling itself to slow death
3
>It’s not a medium of exchange, at least on an everyday basis. ..Not anymore, but it used to be.  Gold's high inherent transactional friction was its fatal flaw which necessitated ever-greater reliance on "second-layer solutions" (i.e., banking) that became increasingly centralized and were ultimately completely subverted.  ..Let's zoom out for a second. Consider that literally *the entire purpose* of money is to reduce transactional friction.  Money does this in three ways: (1) it reduces the friction associated with *finding* a transacting partner (overcoming barter's "double coincidence of wants" problem) by having a huge network effect, i.e., by being widely held and accepted; (2) it reduces the friction of *making* an individual transaction by being highly *transactable*, i.e., by enabling fast, cheap, and reliable transactions; and (3) it reduces the friction of *holding* money *between* transactions by having a reliably-scarce supply. Note that these three attributes correspond generally to the three traditional functions of money.  Only a money that is widely held and accepted and being used to set many prices is suitable for use as a "unit of account," only a money that is highly transactable is suitable for use as a "medium of exchange," and only a money with a reliably-scarce supply is suitable for use as a "store of value."  ..Bitcoin was revolutionary because it was the first form of money that promised to *combine* the reliable scarcity of a physical commodity like gold with the transactability of a purely-digital medium. Indeed, Bitcoin actually promised to make improvements on both fronts.  It promised to be even "harder" than gold by offering a *perfectly* predictable and finite supply, and it *also* promised to be even more transactable than conventional electronic payment systems where the "cost of mediation increases transaction costs, cutting off the possibility for small, casual transactions." In contrast, with Bitcoin, Satoshi envisioned a system where "whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical."  To "take over the world," Bitcoin just needed to *preserve* those two incredible properties (i.e., unprecedented scarcity and unprecedented transactability) while massively growing its network effect to complete the monetary trifecta and become the best form of money the world had ever seen.  Unfortunately, malicious actors have succeeded in derailing the project by preventing the network from scaling.  This has created a situation where, as Bitcoin becomes a better money along one essential dimension (thanks to increased adoption / network effect), it must simultaneously become a *worse* money along a second essential dimension (as rising congestion causes transacting to become increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable). As long as BTC's on-chain capacity remains crippled at toy levels, Bitcoin will be like an increasingly root-bound plant trapped in a too-small pot that chokes on its own attempted growth.  ..(And no, ["second-layers"](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bzjz5i/layers/) aren't a solution.)

1
Correct.  But I don't think the average holder of BTC knows anything about that.  They don't transact because A. BTC is costly to move and a pain to transact with and B. They only got into it because they were dreaming of dollar signs.  They know nothing of Bitcoin's intended use.

1
There are a shit ton of reasons not to "use" any cryptocurrency.  For me, it's mostly because it incurs a taxable event. Not worth it. ..And yes, all cryptocurrencies are a massive pain in general. There are obviously much easier and safer ways to buy stuff, if that's all a person is looking to do.

If you stay inside the carefully curated lines they've painted for all participants, and don't say anything positive about any other crypto ever, you may be safe. But then just being here may be enough for you to eventually be banned.

I'm not sure that mods can track what you read. They will be able to track the comments you make. As an ex-Reddit mod of a large crypto sub (different user ID) I can say that it's no business of any mod what other subs you participate in...As far as that answer goes, I think you are being very generous if you believe that it answers the question as you posed it.
1
taxable events are not bitcoin's fault, this problem is caused by government. bitcoin maxis just don't focus on this. from time to time there are legal proposals to not do capital gains taxes on smallish amounts and bitcoin maxis never focus any attention on these proposals. they stopped caring.
3
I see, not familiar with reddit..I said it answered it quiet well, the question is not very precise (and also not really thought through)   and OP also said "bitcoin core" which is simply the name of the software to run your node, so not sure what's up with that
2
I don't really care who you want to blame, and it's really not that simple either. That won't fix anything. It is what it is, and it sucks. The point is that it's just one of the many reasons crypto really isn't viable as a cash alternative for the general population today. For most, including me, a big reason.
1
Ha! Sorry - I assumed (incorrectly) that you were OP. Not the first time I have made such a mistake...I think "bitcoin core" was probably meant to distinguish against bitcoin cash, but I agree that BTC would have been sufficient.
2
You and I can pass BCH back and forth all day without tax implications.  It works predictably 100% of the time.  Once you get past a short learning curve it really isn't hard to use.
2
No worries, happens to me all the time xd .I really don't get why folks try to force their kind of terms onto everybody, like bitcoin or btc refers to the original bitcoin network, started with the genesis block. .I get the argument, but it's pretty much the trans debate. You can identify whatever you want, but there are biological or in this case technical facts that shouldn't be bend.
1
Uh, huh? Why would we do that? Me and you passing BCH back and forth all day is not an actual use case whatsoever. There has been zero times in my entire life I've needed to do such an odd thing for that matter. We're instead talking about so-called cash use case, you know, buying something. Which is undeniably ridiculous for a ton of reasons, one of which is the tax implications, as I've mentioned. In actual sense it's simply a non starter for most people. I mean, this is really obvious stuff here, come on.
1
We have a little economy going at work.  If I want to chip in for so and sos retirement party I can send the organizer BCH.  If someone owes me for something, perhaps chipping in for an uber ride, they can pay me back in BCH, etc.
1
This is a super niche and unique use case, and it's easily solvable in many existing ways already. Easier ways. Safer ways. More globally accepted ways. Ways that don't require extra steps and time and knowledge. It's actually a really stupid idea, if you think about it. Which is why no one really does such a thing in real life. Except you, I suppose. And I have my suspicions there. ..If this of all things is your big selling point, you're straight up screwed...It's also not even really the use case I'm taking about. The average person using crypto as cash to buy stuff. The thing people like to pretend it's good at, but it's really not at all. Those people are idiots. It's obviously horrible as cash.

I get you're not a fan of cryptocurrency. You've made that abundantly clear. What seems idiotic is that you spend time in a cryptocurrency subreddit trying to convince people it has no future. Isn't there more productive things to do?
1
People should really be made aware if they're being bamboozled. Beats finding out later on...Also, I like crypto just fine, thanks. There are many use cases which are interesting today...Also, I didn't say anything about the future. I was taking about the current situation.
1
Fair enough. The way I see it is the groundwork is being laid now for the future. It can't all come together overnight.
1
I'm not so sure, it's been a lot of years already, and things like the tax laws don't appear to be anywhere near changing. You may be waiting an awfully long time. By then, arguably already, there will be far superior solutions anyway. And we'll be dead. ..Until this and the many other troublesome issues are solved or fixed, pretending it's a viable cash alternative is just silly. Or flat out misleading.

11
Capital that can be created by leveraging capital assets or debt is a form of duplicating capital creating a form of capitalthat does not exist. ...In short those with wealth can create more capital at will (print money) to but more assets while those without capital assets end up exploited. ...The result of capital creation is monetary inflation.  ...Capitalism that results from monetarily inflation is very different to Capitalism that results from sound money.  ...Bitcoin is a novel form of capital in that it can't be artificially created.  ...The fragility of Capitalism based on leveraging capital assets to make capital is exposed when we use bitcoin. Hence all the bankruptcies and the adage "not your keys not your coins." To protect people as opposed to allowing and encouraging those who are over leveraging to claim ownership of your coins.

Societies have a metaphorical tree (their economies).  We grow the tree using seeds (entrepreneurial ideas) and water (work).  We harvest our tree annually for the rich (dividends), the middle class (salaries), and the poor (taxes).  We refertilize our tree each business cycle (lower interest rates).  Capitalistic societies prioritize growing the tree. Socialistic societies prioritize harvesting the tree.

We need sound money to have real capitalism.

I totally agree with your comment.

Yes, we need sound money no matter which economic system we’re shooting for!  Sound money means integrity. The money has integrity, and we have integrity.  Sound money means no shell game behind the scenes. Sound money means the people have the political and financial power. Sound money means power and wealth are not centralized in a few autocrats and their buddies at the top.

Shouldn’t have any issue importing them with the Bcom or Paytaca wallets. Also Electron Cash...Stamps.Cash is a fantastic new site to create paper wallets! Def go and check it out!

Why should paper wallets stop working? They should open up to an address and a private key, right?..The private keys one could import to Electron Cash if they're standard...No idea what QR codes you were using for those wallets, do you have a scan of an old, claimed one so people can see what was inside the QR?

still prefer them, stamped into metal if needed

0.0003 bch? That's 10 cents now, is this correct?
2
*edit, not Electron Cash, that’s the best wallet app by far and I’ve been using it for years, just not for paper wallets I guess…
2
Paytaca doesn't understand the private key format of stamps.cash, but zapit.io and the bitcoin.com wallet can claim them.
2
Thank you, those are all new to me but I will go check them out right now 👍🏼
1
I didn’t say the wallets stopped working I said the block explorers and wallets that used to be able to scan the paper wallets stopped working..I can’t post a picture in a reply but they are the same wallets created at bccaddress.org go look
2
“0.0003 bch“ what you said, is indeed just 10cents, but that’s only 300 bits, 0.000300 bch..1 BCH = 1.000000 or = 1,000,000 bits..3,000 bits is what I was funding my wallets with (I accidentally said 30,000) which was and is about $1 (one buck) 0.003000
3
> the block explorers and wallets ..Which specific explorer[s] or wallet[s]? ..> I can’t post a picture in a reply..Semantics, trolling. You could post a link that presents the photo...> created at bccaddress.org..I, personally, have never been aware of this website. I am also not going to peruse it. If your issue is with that website, contact that website...I [first tagged you as a troll about 3 years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/lgdu1l/why_does_the_bitcoincom_wallet_continue_to_suck/). You seem to be doing the same thing still. Stop trolling.

Here’s an example of the paper wallets I made, my picture from 5 years ago…..https://imgur.com/a/OqjzRVC

Also, that link you posted to an old post, yeah it sounds negative on the face but I’m just trying to point out a new flaw I noticed and hopefully improve what I saw back then, and if you read the responses a lot of people found the same issues and agreed with me - I obviously can’t fix that wallet but I’d imagine if Roger saw & chimed in, which he did, he could get it done…..I don’t want to argue on Reddit, I just want a reliable way to create and use paper wallets -do you have any suggestions?
2
Your tagging is incorrect, I’ve been active and 100% pro-BCH in this community for years even before the split… anyway 🙄..I said Blockchair as in Blockchair.com, you used to be able to hit scan, and use your camera to scan the QR codes on the paper wallets, to verify it has been funded and the current amount there -it doesn’t work anymore..And that website and those paper wallets were very popular and discussed here back in 2017, so now I tag you as a troll -see how easy that was?
3
It has the address right there on your paper wallet. Enter that into a Bitcoin Cash block explorer to view the amount. Scan the private key into a wallet to load it into the Electron Cash wallet.

<SMH> ..An "example" does not allow others to help you...An "example" that does not present the entire QR is also worthless...This, IMO, is trolling. How about you stop fucking around.

Never use a generator like this on-line. If you are serious about security then you'd run it on an off-line machine. I also cannot veryify the veracity of the current implementation (it was a long time ago that I used it)...If you are looking for a way to give out small amounts of BCH easily, then there is this new tool [cashstamps](https://stamps.cash/#/) that you may wish to check out. There is some additional information about it [here](https://medium.com/@BCHF_ORG/bitcoincash-weekly-news-august-19th-2024-by-the-bitcoin-cash-foundation-0ca16dd451b3). I am not endorsing it, since I have never used it, but it seems to be what you might be looking for...Otherwise, I would recommend running Electron-Cash on an off-line machine and generate public/private keys that way. A bit more work, especially if you want to share the QR codes (Electron-Cash can generate them), but doable...EDIT: I also recall messing around with [this one](https://github.com/walletgeneratornet/WalletGenerator.net), many moons ago. Again, use at own risk.

I'll move along. I'm tired of the semantic trolling you're attempting.

Thank you, yes it seems bitaddress, cashaddress, and bccaddress .orgs all use the same code and work the same, more or less, but I vaguely remember some post a long time ago that one was better… anyway, I’ve forgotten more than I know now 😂..To be honest I don’t really care much about security I’m just making a dozen or so paper wallets and funding them with like 3,000 bits each (I originally wrote 30,000 but meant just 3,000, about a $buck each)..And I actually found a setting in the Copay and BitPay apps that turn back on the scanner, allowing one to scan and sweep paper wallets, but it’s off by default for some reason 🤷🏼‍♂️.I’ll try electron cash too, I love that wallet...I mentioned Blockchair can no longer do it, and it seems it’s from the “bitcoincash” text these paper wallet generators add to the front of the address to the QR code, if I take that off or a different paper wallet which doesn’t use that, then Blockchair can indeed scan them, so just FYI… cheers

Decoding your transaction does not show the ID you say should be your UTXO, it shows 07fb39........Try double checking your inputs to make sure they are correct and have not been spent

I got ..Error validating transaction: Transaction d527f1f6eb15c6cdbb6cce4d0014c9a2ab0e9212c3cbd70c1ea29f066c0830d0 orphaned, missing reference 07fb3985c040e3521a75347aa6ddc93de2ad4c48ead5ac071bf1d267422cb7c4. ..Not sure what to make of it.

The errors has been resolved, it was successfully broadcasted here:-  .[https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/35f1c77a30d48aa48561083a1a0a2cdf78ff15a42be1e8abebf622f0afcd9962](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/35f1c77a30d48aa48561083a1a0a2cdf78ff15a42be1e8abebf622f0afcd9962)..The first error was pointed out by u/StrungSafe, i copied the Tx ID for the input to be used directly without knowing it wasn't in little endian, so i had to reverse it when it was being set in to the TxIn variable and reverse it once more when the set value was used to fetch the Tx details from mempool.space, as the site takes the big endian value not the little endian value that is transmitted on the network...The second error was that i set the locktime as 8 bytes instead of 4, though it was originally serialized and parsed as 4, it wasn't until later that it started causing problems...The third error was from the fact that the signature method type wasn't appended to the signature, it is usually appended to the signature in a single byte e.g. if SIGHASH\_ALL was being used 0x01 should be appended to the DER signature...Thanks for all the help.
2
The input ID is reversed, if you take each byte and reverse it then it matches the ID you say it should be
3
Thanks for the reply.  .I just noticed that it is actually reversed, I'll try making a fix now.

Thanks for the reply.  .That was the same type of error i got.
1
Thanks, i actually got the ID from [mempool.space](http://mempool.space) and it was apparently displayed in big endian, and i thought it was little, so i just copied it and used it...  .Now i am getting the error of the script not being valid, I made the signature by Emptying the script sig for the inputs( i have just one input, i didn't keep the change(it's testnet)), putting in the script pub key for the outputs to the previous transaction i am spending there instead, emptying out all the others(just leaving 0x00 there, but in my case there are no others), adding the SIGHASHALL type to the end, then taking the hash. But before the transaction is serialized and sent I put the script sig back in and serialize it...  .So is the above process correct?  .I tried looking through here  [https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/), but i didn't see anything specific enough to answer my questions, my last resort would be going through the bitcoin source code, but i doubt i am capable of doing that...Sorry if i seem ungrateful for you already answering my previous question, but i have been at my computer for the whole of the day trying to get it working with no progress, i have no clue what is wrong because it gets validated on my system with no problems.

I'd suggest using a known good wallet to generate the "same" transaction (but don't broadcast) so you can then build your code to do the same thing. You'll have something to compare to and help troubleshoot. I don't have intimate knowledge off the top my head, what you say is generally correct from my understanding. .....I've generally used existing libraries to build transactions but nowadays I only program on BCH so can't really say what a good BTC library is......Most the libraries I've seen are in JavaScript but shouldn't matter if you just compare transaction hex/json
3
Thanks.  .I am using a Unisat wallet, and it apparently does not have that feature, so i want to try finding options that would allow me to view the hex before broadcasting.

I am considering showing this video to present my humble platform, but the music is too loud to the point of overshadowing your voice.
2
A very interesting and insightful video. ..It correctly points out that Bitcoin (BTC) has failed as a peer to peer cyberpunk currency, but it refused to accept responsibility for the real cause of Bitcoin's failure; ..**This failure is the security deficit caused by the falling block reward**..There is zero evidence that transaction fees will eventually replace block rewards contrary to what is stated in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. There is considerable evidence that fees will not replace falling block rewards regardless of where fixed small block or adaptive big blocks are used. I have been involved with Monero for over a decade and have been primarily involved with Monero's scaling and adaptive blocksize.. I feel very confident in the following:..**1) As the Monero block size increases the fee in reward will at best remain constant or in certain scenarios can fall to zero.**..**2) If the constant block reward of Monero (0.6 XMR)  per block were to be replaced with a falling block reward as in Bitcoin, the entire security and anti spam model of Monero would collapse leading to the eventual collapse of Monero itself.**..If Bitcoin Cash is truly serious it has to stop the halving now, and accept responsibility for what is a disastrous engineering decision; namely the 21 million BCH limit and falling block reward instead of blaming governments and banks for what simply amounts to a very poor design. I understand that the 21 million BCH limit is great marketing but it has led to a classic sell to the greater foul scenario. The latest candidate for the greater fool is non other then Uncle Sam. ..Here is the fee in reward data for Bitcoin, Monero and Bitcoin Cash. ..https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/fee_to_reward-btc-bch-xmr.html#log&3y..Food for thought...Edit: If Bitcoin cash were to stop the halving now it would give Bitcoin Cash security comparable to that of Monero. After the next halving it is downhill from there.

> If Bitcoin Cash is truly serious it has to stop the halving now..Rubbish. ABLA allows Bitcoin Cash blocks to scale and it is notable that to replace all the world's credit card transactions today only requires block sizes of 2.2GB. Even with BCH TX fees of under a penny, 2.2GB blocks will yield miners $14.85M/day to secure the network. For perspective, if BTC wanted to match this level of security, BTC would need to charge an average TX fee of $40. And by the way, Bitcoin Cash can ship 2.2GB blocks in just 11MB with Xthinner...The problem is not that the block reward runs out but that BTC can not transition to fees alone like BCH can as BTC has broken the scaling model set out by Satoshi. edit fixed typo.
16
> There is zero evidence that ........ Monero's tail emission will be sufficient to secure Monero's future either, just like with Bitcoin's halving...FTFY
6
> There is zero evidence that transaction fees will eventually replace block rewards..The current Bitcoin *fee* income is significantly greater (more than twice) than the inflation plus fee income of BCH and Monero combined.  You could throw in some other "big block" coins into that comparison if you wanted too.  So if you think Bitcoin hasn't already proved its long term viability from fee income, then you should conclude that BCH and Monero are *already* dead like a loonie toons character that hasn't looked down yet...A fixed amount subsidy also diminishes to zero real value over time too, it's just hidden in inflation... so even if was a security advantage over some period it would eventually become negligible...I don't say this to insult Monero, -- at least it has some good privacy technology. But your point is not a good one.  Only blockchains that have limited capacity have shown evidence that fees can support their security.  And the only high profile blockchain that has backdoored to allow arbitrary coin theft-- you know the whole thing the security is to prevent-- is one where the lack of capacity limits made it impractical for users to run nodes and independently enforce the rules (BSV).  So while I think Monero's capacity control scheme is interesting, the fact that it both doesn't work without perpetual inflation (and really, with inflating inflation rather than constant nominal-- as it is loss of subsidy will eventually stop being an incentive to stop bloating the chain because subsidy will become negligible in real terms) and that it doesn't explicitly protect nodes from being driven off the network leaves that control scheme kind of dubious at best, and certainty unproven compared to Bitcoin...Everything the bitcoin tech community has said about these issues seems to have played out, it's delusional to not only fail to acknowledge that but pretend that the polar opposite is the most likely long term result.

"clickbait" means the title is misleading. It is not so you are wrong. Also your attempt to sensationalize is not adding you points.
3
> The problem is not that the block reward runs out but that BTC can not transition to fees alone like BCH can as BTC has broken the scaling model set out by Satoshi. edit fixed typo...Yet  the Bitcoin fee in reward is like an order of magnitude larger than the Bitcoin Cash fee in reward. Large block do not fix the security issue at all. . This is what I said about Monero and the Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash data supports my model for Monero....Let me be clear small blocks do not fix the security issue either, they only delay the inevitable 51% attack. The optimal day for such an attack is Christmas Day (December 25)  since that is when world economic activity is at its lowest. This makes the 51% attack a Scrooge attack. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenezer_Scrooge..The ghost of Christmas yet to come will haunt Bitcoin is its small block and large block variants...Edit: The lowest economic activity means the lowest transaction volume and fee revenue for the miners. Hence the optimal time to attack

> The current Bitcoin fee income is significantly greater (more than twice) than the inflation plus fee income of BCH and Monero combined. You could throw in some other "big block" coins into that comparison if you wanted too. So if you think Bitcoin hasn't already proved its long term viability from fee income, then you should conclude that BCH and Monero are already dead like a loonie toons character that hasn't looked down yet...This ignores the fact that the market capitalization of Bitcoin is over 400x that of Monero and over 180x that of Bitcoin Cash. If one has an asset that is 400x as valuable I would consider it only reasonable to spend 400x to secure it. The real metric is to compare that amount spent on security to the market capitalization after factoring in lost coins. ..> A fixed amount subsidy also diminishes to zero real value over time too, it's just hidden in inflation... so even if was a security advantage over some period it would eventually become negligible...This is covered in Peter Todd's article. https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary It predicts an equilibrium between the tail emission and lost coins leading to an effectively constant supply. ..> Only blockchains that have limited capacity have shown evidence that fees can support their security...I would consider small blocks to be a necessary **but not sufficient condition** for fees to replace block rewards for security. So yes Bitcoin is in a somewhat better position here than big block or adaptive block coins with falling block rewards, but this comparison is not evidence that fees will replace the falling block rewards in Bitcoin. Proving that Bitcoin SV does not work does not prove that Bitcoin works.  ..> Everything the bitcoin tech community has said about these issues seems to have played out, it's delusional to not only fail to acknowledge that but pretend that the polar opposite is the most likely long term result...It is not delusional to take the position that **both** sides of the polar opposite Bitcoin debate have **not** provided a viable **long term** solution. What each side has demonstrated, very well in my opinion, is that the other side has not...So I remain convinced that what Monero has implemented with a constant tail emission of 0.6 XMR is close to optimal in providing long term security.

It's mostly people outside the community that sees Roger Ver as the leader of BCH. They often also think that he created BCH. Roger Ver was heavily responsible with the startup of XRP. Is he the leader of xrp also? He helped spread  early adoption of bitcoin and later switched his focus to BCH, because he saw it more true to be p2p digital cash. He was right in that regard.. the narrative around BTC is moving away from the money usecase more and more each year.

Title: Can Bitcoin Stop War? The Potential of Decentralized Finance in Ending Global Conflicts
0
To me the attractive factor about Bitcoin in this issue is that Bitcoin is permissionless. Being decentralized is a prerequisite for that, i guess.....In contrast, current finance is quite centralized, and permissioned...They can turn off access to banking to pretty much whomever they see fit, and are mostly unanswerable for their decisions...Under this system, when there is war (and there always seems to be), dissident voices can be quickly and effectively suppressed. No real anti-war movement can grow. You can construct such an impenetrable thicket of rules and regulations around legacy finance that you could find anyone in violation of something, and pursue them legally. This goes hand in hand with the near complete loss of financial privacy for all those who are partaking in this "banked" system. I think this is a major point in why we "can't stop war" so far - even though the issue is very complex and it's certainly not going to be as simple as "_just use Bitcoin, and presto, no more war_".
6
As digital warfare becomes more effective and much cheaper than meatspace warfare I tend to think any real world conflict is just an inventory reduction for the international military industrial complex.
3
So more anarchy means less war? I think you have it the wrong way around.

In short, yes! Or, at least mitigate it. War is very costly and requires the money printer to go BRRRRR! ..I have a stack of these I slap up wherever I can.

That's my impression at least...Besides, crypto isn't trendy at the moment.

I hope never. People who want the value in USD to go up, still hasn't understood shit about fk...BlackRock is now the 3rd biggest BTC holder (2nd biggest practically)... And all for what? What's been the benefit to the world and to Bitcoin?
8
Grayscale said they would apply for one as soon as they believed it'd be approved...  That was last year if I remember correctly.  However, I have to believe that spot ETFs aren't in their best interest since they refuse to lower their fees and be competitive.  All that's happened with GBTC and ETHE is that Grayscale is now making 65% less money in passive management fees.
2
Probably soon. Bcore got an etf and BCH is better in everyway as a POW coin. So there is precedent.
2
there are 12 coins with more market cap than BCH, including DOGE, Cardano and lowly, lowly Shiba, we would have to exhaust each of those by the time we get to BCH.. by that time the total number of guys trying to buy crypto through their broker will be 6 at most

Makes total sense. True believers in electronic p2p cash, don’t measure the Value in Fiat money. .But lets be honest, i want to buy a house soon, i can only buy it in my local currency, so i still care slightly about a good time to sell

That's true, but nothing can replace the organic growth of a currency that works. We need to work towards that. If we want numbers to go up, and majority of the coins to be owned by some financial institution... I don't think we will get very far...I do believe crypto is revolutionary, and the revolution is soon to come, if we are to react to the way governments are acting.
6
The ETFs didn’t help ETH or BTC any either, the rally was abortive, short lived and adjusted for inflation BTC didn’t even set a new ATH. BTC is now a true SoV and the NgU days are gone. 1-5%/year, at best, with the occasional 20-95% crash thrown in.

As part of the General Protocols team, I must note that BigInt is not remotely close to ready. People should exercise a lot of caution, and if you really want to see it happen sooner rather than later, put in intense work...https://x.com/GeneralProtocol/status/1825786324030468296
16
BigInt CHIP:..> Many financial and cryptographic applications require higher-precision arithmetic than is currently available to Bitcoin Cash contracts...This seems a very sparse motivation to raise the max VM number size from 8 to 258 bytes...Can we assemble a listing of the financial applications referred above?..258 bytes seems overdimensioned to me for finance. If I'm thinking too small here, please correct me with some references to actual applications!..For cryptographic purposes it seems more likely to introduce new opcodes as needed, rather than expand the VM number type...I would urge caution in expanding the max number size to that extent without a heck of a lot of impact exploration. Top of my head here is the question whether it could be used to facilitate cheap-ish unpruneable data storage (i.e. circumvent the pruneable data carrier existing in OP_RETURN)

Already the name is bad. Non-technical people just don't get it..."Why should I trust a non-confirmed tx? Why should I use BCH? LTC and Doge are much faster." ..That's the reality on the adoption front...My second vote goes to UTXO commitments.
1
TLDR of our opinion you will find at the link:..- VM limits CHIP is on track for 2025 activation.- Big big int CHIP is not on track for 2025 activation, and it's going to require pulling several rabbits out of several hats through a lot of hard work to get on track...This is relative to [the CHIP process](https://gitlab.com/im_uname/cash-improvement-proposals/-/blob/master/CHIPs.md) that GP follows.
12
once you make the jump from int64 to anything above it, you're in the bigint zone because in c++ code you need to implement higher ops using lower int64 ops, and really it doesn't matter whether you move on to 128bit 256bit or 258 byte, because bigint algorithms work all the same no matter the size of the integer, and the costs scale linearly with number size for add/sub, and quadratically for mul/div/mod, so we can just set a computation limit on those to be in line with other limits and not exceed the baseline (checksig) in any case..we can already implement bigger int ops using Script int64 ops, but then you waste a lot of TX bytes to do it (I experimented with this and had to use like 4 inputs, almost 2000 bytes just to do some 256-bit add & mul). If we just raised the int limit, it would be the c++ doing the ops to execute 1 opcode, rather than script writers wasting 100s of opcodes to get the same functionality, so TX would save on size, and on CPU cost of such TX too because Script is less efficient than c++
8
For cryptographic purposes, one area I think we want our VM script to be able to handle is privacy applications. ..Privacy schemes may use zero knowledge proofs, special types of signatures, etc. I am definitely not an expert here, but I think privacy is one area where non-traditional cryptographic operations and big numbers may be helpful...If we explicitly add a privacy op code then that opens a can of worms on becoming a privacy coin. And it restricts the privacy model to whatever the op code is and forces one privacy model for all applications.
7
> 258 bytes seems overdimensioned to me for finance. If I'm thinking too small here, please correct me with some references to actual applications!..the number was found in old Satoshi code, he had the limit there for a while, so Jason picked it as a familiar point..actually we can just [increase them to max (10,000 bytes for add/sub and about 2800 bytes for mul/div/mod)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bigint/issues/1) because once you have the limit framework in, you can just limit the whole script to cumulative cost and it doesn't matter whether people use 2byte ints or 100byte or 1000 byte, the Script can't exceed the bar of total CPU cost per input in any case...with that there's 1 more application: 4096 RSA crypto ops, in case we get close to QCs breaking ECC it could be an interim solution because RSA is more QC resistant..>For cryptographic purposes it seems more likely to introduce new opcodes as needed, rather than expand the VM number type...then you introduce tech debt for every such crypto op, what if some other crypto system is better? with big ints people can just implement w/e they want - at 0 additional tech debt
7
>Top of my head here is the question whether it could be used to facilitate cheap-ish unpruneable data storage..you can already push a 520-byte item on stack from the input script (pruneable), you just can't do math ops on it, supporting math ops would add nothing to storage options, no impact at all

Which particular application of big int motivates you?
8
Bitcoin Unlimited (from where Tailstorm originates) intends to implement it in Nexa. BCH could reuse their work after it has been implemented and is stable in Nexa.
5
it's on track as long as there's a chance of it making it, maybe it's behind the limits one, but it could still get a boost and catch up
8
Those are some good prospective savings, thanks for clarifying...But whether they make a big splash still boils down to number of applications that could use them...For the financial realm, I sort of have right now the hashrate prediction (betting) market, ZCE (I guess? don't know how this is affected in detail) and the potential privacy implementations mentioned by u/d05CE . Any others?..>  so we can just set a computation limit on [mul/div/mod]..I'm a bit worried about such basic arithmetic operations failing due to performance limits. I don't think script writers can always anticipate all kinds of inputs they might get, so whether their scripts then work becomes uncertain?.At least it seems that way to me. Could it open the door to  a new kind of script-based attack vector for smart contract based applications?
2
This is a really good point to ponder, thanks...Privacy straddles the financial and cryptographics application domains.
3
> actually we can just increase them to max (10,000 bytes for add/sub and about 2800 bytes for mul/div/mod)..Very very nice. Seems like this is the way to go, but we really need to vet it out and do our due diligence. We can always raise from 258 to a higher number, but if we can just get it in one shot that will save a lot of time, energy, and lines of code...Over constraining a system is usually not ideal, because then as you continue building, some assumptions are based on one constraint and other assumptions are based on the other constraint and you lose one source of truth.
3
Some really sexy crypto ops become possible ...
4
Fair enough. We just have different definitions of "on track".
6
I'm interested in chainwork oracle but ZK proofs are a big deal imo, and being able to implement RSA ops in Script could come in handy if we get close to QCs breaking elliptic curve crypto..> Any others?..Idk, but to be frank I dislike the "what are the applications?" approach to calculator's number limit..like, we can get it for no impact to TX processing cost..if until now I had a calculator that could work with 2-digit numbers but would error on 3-digit numbers, do I really need to enumerate all possible applications of 10-digit number operations to upgrade the calculator? The hell do I know what people will use 10-digit math for - just give them the calc and see what they do with it :)..we know some applications, and imo those few applications should be enough because they're nice benefits and costs are 0
8
>basic arithmetic operations failing due to performance limits..That can not happen, a TX is either valid or invalid based on its contents, it's not dependent on time it takes to process it (and arithmetic ops are relatively orders of magnitude faster than other ops like checkdatasig)..The contents of a TX determine its validity, nothing else. If contents of a TX require VM to do some ops more than the limit, then the TX is invalid - and everyone will see it like that, no matter how much time it took them to validate the TX (individual times will vary based on hardware).
6
Some benchmark results came today, I extracted the interesting part (ops near the cost limit):..    # ID, TxByteLen, Hz, Cost, CostPerByte, Description.    trxhzt, 366, 11876.3, 1.000, 1.000000, "[baseline] 2 P2PKH inputs, 2 P2PKH outputs (one Schnorr signature, one ECDSA signature) (nonP2SH)".    6w680g, 8419, 12328.7, 0.963, 0.041878, "[benchmark] OP_MUL 2048-byte number (alternating bits set) and 2048-byte number (alternating bits set) (P2SH32)".    34vzam, 8408, 8772.7, 1.354, 0.058930, "[benchmark] OP_MUL 4096-byte number (alternating bits set) and 4096-byte number (alternating bits set) (nonP2SH)"..So, with the budgeting system introduced by VM Limits CHIP, a 400 byte TX could be allowed to do one 2kB x 2kB multiplication, or a bunch of 256-bit multiplications, but in any case the CPU cost can't exceed the cost of a typical P2PKH TX...Like, you'd get an allowance of how many bytes your TX can operate on, and you can't exceed it whatever you do...The BigInt CHIP is basically VM Limits CHIP applied to arithmetic opcodes the same way as others (hash ops, stack ops). It's a no-brainer IMO, but Jason did the responsible thing and extracted it as separate CHIP.
3
ok but what is the end user application / use case that you want the most?
6
I want to build a native chainwork oracle, with current opcodes I need to waste 2000 bytes to do some uint256 ops, with bigint that would take just a few opcodes

Title: USD hyperinflation & Bitcoin
0
Tether in printing $1000 million every 9.1 days. Most Tether is used to inflate the price of BTC. Even if USD didn't hyper inflate, there is no real value underpinning BTC. ..Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, is used mainly as a medium of exchange, so doesn't rely on being converted to another currency in order to buy goods and services.
7
One of the outcomes of hyper-inflation is that people stop valuing things in that currency. ..So nothing is priced in Confederate Dollars or Reichsmarks. ..When ideas fail to the point that hyperinflation occurs, it's generally game over for that currency...***..The Nazis had a really efficient centralized bureaucracy within their medical system for determining which people were or were not medically relevant. So whether people had Reichsmarks (or even health insurance) didn't necessarily determine whether they could get healthcare from a Nazi doctor. ..So a lot of people working for Reichsmarks were actually just trying to blend in and not get on the naughty list. But when it became clear there wouldn't be hospitals, roads, houses or markets for them to send their stupid nazi money, they found the true value of the currency.
4
Nobody knows. The likely outcome is, that Bitcoin tanks as everything else. As a high risk asset everyone will sell it for lower risk assets.

Duh this is joke?

If the tether bubble bursts, btc will take BCH with it surely?
2
So once game over comes for USD how do you protect your savings?
2
This is concerning. How to avoid the crash of all crashes? Precious metals?
1
The difference is that Bitcoin Cash is backed by many merchants using BCH as a medium of exchange. Were the price to collapse somewhat, these merchants still make money.
6
For clarification I posted this here instead of the bitcoin Reddit for obvious reasons 😂
3
the truth is we won't know till it happens. I don't think BCH is currently being used enough as a MOE for it to hold up on its own. I'd love to be proven wrong though..

You can pick your own values, you don't have to observe the decreed values.
1
gold and silver..guns and butter
1
Im a big proponent of having a few different valuables that cannot be inflated away. some examples: crypto, alcohol, precious metals, long shelf life food, real estate. maybe some index stocks but they will only be ok in the longer term post crash. Just try your best

Title: How to use BCH to access AI images and text
21
Also, by means of an update: ..- We added Sonar Online Huge. Sonar Online Huge is able to browse the internet. It's based on the biggest Llama 3.1, and can for example summarize content if you feed it with a link or respond with up to date information on any subject..- Flux Pro, Realism and Schnell have been added which are genuinely amazing image models. The image in the video was created using Schnell which is the "worst" model in the Flux family, Pro and Realism generate just ridiculously good images..- We've optionally turned off NSFW filters on all these models, check out "settings" to toggle them off. Realism especially is great at NSFW.
3
i use free AI tools for questions but for images i will use this magnificent creation, thanks
2
Some suggestions:  .- Can't delete individual conversations (or I don't see how; I can only delete all individual messages within a conversation, but the conversation with its title still exists in the Conversations page).  .- Sometimes (rarely) a conversation crashes and stops working forever. "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)."..Overall really useful product, I'm using it every day since you let me know about it here some weeks ago.
2
Thanks! Feedback is very welcome!..I honestly thought we had the ability to delete conversations - fairly sure we had it at some point so it must have gone out accidentally. Sorry about that, I agree we should have it in there...The conversation crashing and stopping working is a super-confusing error for us that we haven't been able to figure out yet, unfortunately :/ Any information you have about what model you were using and roughly how big the conversation was would be very useful to have...Thanks for using our service! And thanks for the feedback!
1
Sure. It always happened with chatGPT 4.0 and quite long conversations, often 1-day long but with multiple long messages, costing like 0.6 to 1 nano cost per reply.
2
Thanks, okay. I'm thinking it might have to do with going over the max token limit somehow. Will play around with that, see whether I can recreate it that way. Thanks a lot!
2
Please update me on any change about this
2
Update is I managed to go over the token limit successfully on every model hah, and we have a branch that when pushed should at least display an error saying you've gone over the token limit for that specific model and that switching to a higher limit model such as Gemini is recommended...Don't think that actually fixes the crashing and stopping working though - I didn't get that in any of my conversations annoyingly.
1
Thanks. Any ETA on deleting specific conversations? Currently there's only a delete button at the top of the conversations page, to delete everything, but can't delete specific ones one by one.  .If you want to reproduce the crashing error, just copypaste multiple rows of excel data (multiple columns, because I think it has to do with the separation in # of spaces between column and column, when pasting the data).  .IMO the AIs or your interface should just reply when it's too much data pasted
2
> Thanks. Any ETA on deleting specific conversations? Currently there's only a delete button at the top of the conversations page, to delete everything, but can't delete specific ones one by one...When you click that delete button, you can select individual conversations to delete. Guess we should make that clearer in the UI! It doesn't delete all at once...>  If you want to reproduce the crashing error, just copypaste multiple rows of excel data (multiple columns, because I think it has to do with the separation in # of spaces between column and column, when pasting the data)...This is perfect, thank you. That should help solve it...>  IMO the AIs or your interface should just reply when it's too much data pasted..The next version we push (hopefully tomorrow) has:..- An error displaying when you go over the token limit, recommending a different model..- A warning message when you're getting close to the token limit within a conversation, where it lists the input tokens you're using, the max of the model, and recommends switching to a model with higher token limit.
1
Great, thanks. Is there a telegram group for further feedback and suggestions? discord is too much hassle for me IMO.
2
2/2: and now that I'm here, ill give further suggestions:  .- the ability to name conversations, in order to keep track easier of the multiple topics i have open & am working with in each convo. Currently, the conversation "name" is the first words of the first message.  .- display wallet value in USD, now more so given that nanogpt now works with 3 currencies. Is nano 0.90$ today? 0.31$? The unit of account for people in crypto continues being the USD, that's how we think and understand value easier
2
We don't have a Telegram unfortunately, we have our Twitter (NanoGPTCom), Discord and here on Reddit. My personal Telegram is @senatusspqr, feel free to contact me there if you find that easier!

and also message cost in USD
2
>  - the ability to name conversations, in order to keep track easier of the multiple topics i have open & am working with in each convo. Currently, the conversation "name" is the first words of the first message...Yes sir. Makes sense...>  - display wallet value in USD, now more so given that nanogpt now works with 3 currencies. Is nano 0.90$ today? 0.31$? The unit of account for people in crypto continues being the USD, that's how we think and understand value easier..Yeah.. we want to keep it in Nano for frankly sentimentality and supporting Nano's sake, but I think displaying in USD does make more sense...The thing is we do everything *on* Nano. It's literally held on-chain in Nano and every prompt is a transaction. So I'm wondering whether it would not be even more confusing to have $0.90 when you go offline, then have it be $0.95 or $0.85 when you log in in the morning. What do you think?

The whitepaper and Hijacking Bitcoin.
23
Hijacking Bitcoin all day!   The fella who wrote it was around since early on with Bitcoin.  He's one of the biggest proponents.  Over the years BTC has changed yet his opinion towards Bitcoin has not.  If you want an honest historial perspective of the innovation Satoshi brought to us this is a great read.

Careful here, this sub can be dangerous.  You can learn a lot here, when you're ready.  But for a newcomer trying to learn, stick with r/bitcoin and read as many books as you can...I agree with the comments here suggesting you read "Hijacking Bitcoin"...   but I'd suggest reading it much later, after you really understand the mechanics of Bitcoin and the fiat system.  It can easily lead a newcomer astray. There's a dozen books I'd read before that one..."Broken Money" by Lyn Alden is the best if you had to pick only one to read..."The Sovereign Individual".."The Creature from Jekyll Island"..Both of Alex Gladstein's books..."Layered Money".."Gradually, Then Suddenly"..If you are going to read "Hijacking Bitcoin", do it around the same time as "The Blocksize War" so you can get as much of the big picture as possible.

Yes 100% this is the best book written on the subject.

I second this. 100% must read if you want the full perspective on Bitcoin.

Are you aware of the Security Budget issue ?    .Not intending to be incendiary on the Socials here.   But it’s a fundamental issue.

Two interesting comments appearing in the recent posts here :     ..1.   “ It deserves to be censored. ”    .2.  “ Careful … this sub can be dangerous. ”    ..What do you think of those comments ?
2
Yeah, BTC has a real security problem, and L2s aren't going to fix it. Thankfully we have BCH which doesn't have the problem.
4
I'm curious; Did you read the whitepaper and/or Hijacking Bitcoin?  .I'm not allowed to ask on r​/Bitcoin. They blocked me for even asking.
8
Do this if you want a completely censored view of everything, and be very careful what you say. Otherwise read hijacking bitcoin and learn what it’s all about.
9
The difference is r/btc is open you can talk about all things Bitcoin even forks, r/bitcoin is highly censored to one narrative and negativ posts and embarrassing questions are usually deleted.
6
Both comments made by the same account, a known small blocker account..What I make of this is that a _peer to peer electronic cash system_ still represents the same threat to some people as it did in 2009-2016. They would like to censor discussion of it.
2
One day the block reward will run out, and the fees will have to stand in....BTC will fail one day if people are not willing to pay high fees. (BTC network limited by 1mb block size cap, so a small number of participants has to pay high fees). BCH will fail one day if there are not many people using the network. (much higher network capacity, lots of small fees added together)..It is the continuation of the bitcoin experiment!
3
Forks are the biggest risk to Bitcoin's ability to overthrow central banking and global oppression.  They shouldn't be "discussed" EVER...I do think many of the points made in Roger's book are very good and it's a shame they aren't being discussed in the mainstream Bitcoin community.  But that's not because of censorship, it's because people here are supporting a fork instead of being patient and spending years to help steer the community (and the devs) to the best path.  It will take time, there are many views and things to consider, and nefarious actors to overcome.  Bad things will happen in the community at times.  There will always be people we disagree with.  Forking is never the answer.  Forking was a huge mistake.  It deserves to be "censored".
-1
Yeah agreed..Was looking at comments on all the Utubes, like Bitcoin Magazine, Nashville conference, etc.   .All praising 3rd Party Custodians.   ..“What’s wrong with Custodians ?   That’s fine.  We don’t need self-custody.”..Same with the recent What BTC Did pod.    .Softening the ground …. now preaching how trusted custodians is a *GOOD* thing.  ..“It doesn’t matter that Lightning is unusable by 98% of people.  They’ll use Custodians.  Boom … solved !”
2
The opposite is true. ..>Forks are the biggest risk to Bitcoin's ability to overthrow central banking and global oppression. ..Forks are freedom otherwise you can get captured. ..>But that's not because of censorship,..It's exactly because of censorship..> it's because people here are supporting a fork instead of being patient and spending years to help steer the community (and the devs) to the best path. It will take time, there are many views and things to consider, and nefarious actors to overcome...What's the difference between waiting patiently and being captured and immobilized? ..>Forking is never the answer...Forking is sometimes the only way out, the only way to resolve disagreement and the only way forward. ...>Forking was a huge mistake...Forking preserved a p2p cash Bitcoin without the segwit abomination.(that later lead to Ordinals, Runes etc, because the Core devs are bad and do not care about p2p cash but to push their own agenda including L2s)..>It deserves to be "censored"...Thanks for showing your true colors.

>Forks are the biggest risk to Bitcoin's ability to overthrow central banking and global oppression. ..Yes! Especially the ones introducing RBF and SegWit are.

Network affect is everything.  It's what matters...Forking breaks that...If disagreements and "capture" can't be handled via decades of discourse and hard work, then Satoshi's experiment has failed in my mind.  Forking is just as bad as being "captured"...I'm at a point right now where I agree BTC has been "captured".  But I strongly believe that supporting a fork is never an option.  What's to stop it from being the target of capture if it starts to gain seriously global traction as BTC has?  More forks?  More public confusion and infighting?..If "forking is sometimes the only way out", then I think the experiment has failed.  Either that, or you simply don't have a long enough time horizon.  If BTC has been "captured" it can be un-captured eventually.  Forking is a way of giving up and making yourself irrelevant.  (unless it's a uncontentious fork, obviously)..  .Edit:   I'm not saying you're wrong that "forking is sometimes the only way out"...  I'm saying that IF you're right, then it's a death knell to Bitcoin (and any of its forks)... it's the end of the experiment.  I'm 50/50 right now as whether you're right, meaning Bitcoin has failed, or whether we can un-capture a blockchain if given enough time and incentive.

>Network affect is everything. It's what matters...No it is not e.g. Blockbuster vs Netflix..Also BTC does not have network effect, it has FOMO. I can sell all my BTC in seconds and have no reduced service. ..>Forking breaks that...No it does not. People that do not agree leave anyway when they can't fork. Some just start their own chain. Ergo the explosion of chains after BTCs capture...>If disagreements and "capture" can't be handled via decades of discourse and hard work, then Satoshi's experiment has failed in my mind. Forking is just as bad as being "captured". I'm at a point right now where I agree BTC has been "captured". But I strongly believe that supporting a fork is never an option. ..That's just your opinion. Most thing otherwise. ..>What's to stop it from being the target of capture if it starts to gain seriously global traction as BTC has? More forks? More public confusion and infighting?..A prepared community and improved  advanced processes. Also a spread out community, no capture of a single medium will disable them as it did in 2015...Your aversion against forks stems from the years of brainwashing that happend in the BTC community. In order to capture Bitcoin it was necessary to destroy forking. And they almost succeeded. The believe in the one and only savior is almost cult like and is the thing that keeps BTC as roadblock alive. If someone invented BTC today everyone would laugh at it, because all PoW coins are working better. ..Forget BTC, the damage is done. BCH devs spend a long time unfucking the code after the fork and they didn't even have to deal with segwit or taproot. Be glad BCH exists and use and support it.

It's non-custodial.

Sure and the Coindesk quote you've given clearly states "Components supports", which is entirely accurate. While the second Flexa quote references "payments" specifically, also accurate. As both above different links also show. ..You are comparing quotes about two different aspects, components and payments, in your first post - as if they are the same, quite unfairly...Coindesks linked article is literally about Flexa Components!

The coindesk article talks about their point of sales tool, that is „payments“. Nothing of what they say about Flexa has anything todo with building custom e-commerce apps (which is components). Coindesk probably does not understand the distinction in the first place.

I was inspired a couple weeks ago by your flipstarter projects to think of a potentially better funding option for multi-part projects like this one. Below are the two threads about the idea with some input from other people. Could this idea work better, as an additional option, than the current way goals are designed? What do you think?...https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/1eol9e8/can_we_get_upper_and_lower_limits_as_an_option/...https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ehz7b0/can_we_get_upper_and_lower_limits_as_an_option/

https://flipstarter.techhausa.com/en

I support your idea of tiered funding goals. It's a practical approach. For instance, if a project aims for 30 BCH but only raises 10 BCH, it can still proceed with a scaled-down version of the project using the available funds. Demonstrating progress with the initial funds can attract further support to reach the full goal.

Clearly not true. And they only want a one-sided peer review, which is no peer review at all.

TLDR - it will go right and maybe up or down. Thanks mate.

Title: "Can I use it when I need to?" is more important to what people consider money than "does it lose value sometimes?"

"99.96% of previous days value".... is a 14% annual inflation rate. This might not be considered a "slow loss of value". I think you chose a number intentionally close to 100% to make a point, but 14% is still a high decay

If merchants are only interested in using centralised third parties to convert received payments into dollars then bitcoin is not a currency to them. ..If consumers only want the dollar price for their groceries then bitcoin is not a currency to them. ..If investors are only concerned about how much more dollars they can get back out after some time then bitcoin is not a currency to them...So to whom is bitcoin a currency? Those few people who understand what 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin truly means. Those who understand that bitcoin isn't digital gold, it's a **crypto currency**. You will only find these people using BCH and XMR. Unfortunately, most people are only interested in speculating on BTC, ETH killers and memecoins.

I don’t really hear the argument that BTC makes good money very often tbh (and it’s ironic that you posted on this sub because for sure you’ll get BCH fans affirming that and arguing for BCH as an alternative). ..One thing is for sure- BTC a great store of value, and that’s all that really matters from a utility perspective in 2024- and it’s not that it lacks sell-side liquidity to move across asset classes easily and quickly. ..But more broadly- it’s not even an argument about the transactional properties within specific crypto protocols. Crypto just isn’t at a point of mass adoption from a point of sale perspective- imo the only way it gets there is to be more fully integrated into traditional financial products, otherwise you just don’t have the consumer base to effect change from the business side of the retail equation. ..And even then, the accounting layer for most businesses just doesn’t make sense- businesses pay their suppliers and costs in fiat, with most businesses ultimately working with small margins (average profit margin in retail is 2.5%). Swapping between currencies to cover those costs just isn’t going to be feasible for most. The world is a long way from a crypto wide future.

But it is fairly accurate for the dollar. Don't forget that the CPI they push is just a narrative that they construct to fool people into believing lies...If you look into it I think you'll find that it is reporters representing CPI as "the number" for inflation. The Fed is a little more careful in their language, relying on un/diseducated reporters to conflate inflation with CPI.

> I don’t really hear the argument that BTC makes good money very often tbh..Unsurprising, after 10+ years of propaganda and Core's technical efforts against it being usable as a good money..> One thing is for sure- BTC a great store of value..I for one am certainly not convinced of that...> Swapping between currencies to cover those costs just isn’t going to be feasible for most..As long as swapping incurs high fees, you are right. But there's no fundamental reason this needs to persist, it's a function of availability of decentralized swaps. In other words, current situation is middlemen skimming large profits.

Every revolution had these guys that point out why it will ultimately fail. Nobody needs to vote, the king knows best!

> One thing is for sure- BTC a great store of value..Can you point me to the technicalities that make BTC a great store of value that other chains don't have?

14% might represent an actual inflation number from the past couple of years but not any sort of normal inflation…even if it’s “hidden”. ..That means stuff would double in price every 8 years which isn’t the norm.

1/ ‘Core propaganda’ blah blah blah. Honestly, Bitcoin works great as an SoV, if you don’t want to use it, don’t use it! ..2/ You don’t have to be: consumers and the market have already spoken...3/ The point is that swapping shouldn’t be necessary at all. The guy running bodega at the corner isn’t jumping on a DEX so that he can cover his next order of cola ffs. Fiat is king for the foreseeable future. And fees are never going to scale to zero with any fully decentralised, secure, and scalable blockchain- that’s the blockchain dilemma in a nutshell.
-5
Eh, I'm not a maxi of anything. Your comment on the other hand reeks of it. The world is complex and things will not shift in a day, being pragmatic about those outcomes is more rational that invoking for widespread change that is unachievable in the current context. ..The world is a set of inter-related transactions between individuals, businesses, and their governments: fiat currencies are an important mechanism within that set of relationships. There are 180 fiat currencies active today, and just like the related governments, those will not disappear in an instant. ..Crypto can and will exist alongside fiat, but expecting it to completely absorb them is a fools errand.
1
Just take a look at BTC vs all other tokens over a 10 year period. It beats every one—and it's not a matter of price in fiat terms but rather the relative value retained against all other crypto assets. In fact, across all asset classes Bitcoin is only second to Nvidia in terms of long-term growth—and you could argue that Nvidia has reached a speculative short-term peak.  The fact that your comment even has upvotes is some sort of crazy Stockholm Syndrome tbh, it's as though people's emotional allegiance to other protocols clouds a rational conclusion that 'yes, BTC has been a pretty fucking great SoV'. This is a BTC sub, so that shouldn't be controversial. Peace.
0
Don't forget about 'shrinkflation', where products are smaller for the same price.  .  .Also there's the fact that in a capitalist market economy prices are supposed to be going down due to competition and productivity increases. That means that prices NOT falling is an indication of inflation - although it is really hard to quantify...But yeah, even though the government is lying about the inflation rate, it has been getting worse lately.
1
> Core propaganda’ blah blah blah. Honestly, ~Bitcoin~ BTC works great as an SoV, if you don’t want to use it, don’t use it..BTC isn't a SoV. If it was, it would appreciate around 1-5%/year and be pretty stable. Maxis like you have moonlambo dreams, you don't want BTC for a SoV, you want it because it sometimes does a NgU...> You don’t have to be: consumers and the market have already spoken...Market never stops speaking...> Fiat is king for the foreseeable future. And fees are never going to scale to zero with any fully decentralised, secure, and scalable blockchain- that’s the blockchain dilemma in a nutshell...There's a big difference between $1000/tx fees and $0.1/tx fees...

Bravo if everyone was like you no revolution would have ever succeeded.

So it's just make believe? A hype. You can't point to the why, you just follow the herd like everyone else. ..It doesn't even produce anything or is useful for any application, like Nvidia or Gold. Quite to the contrary, but it has stark supporters with Tether which prints money out of thin air and buys BTC with it. ..And then imagine when the next best hype comes along? We've been waiting for 3 years for the 100k now. Top buyers in 2021 are still not in the greens. Looks like the hype is (very slowly) dying.
5
> Just take a look at BTC vs all other tokens over a 10 year period..Yeah that's nice, and what fundamentally gives BTC any valuation?..> This is a BTC sub, so that shouldn't be controversial..Reading comprehension of sidebar and sticky rated zero.
2
Do you not see the disclaimer on every investment account statement you get "past performance is not a guarantee of future results"..Yet here you are looking exclusively at past performance to determine the suitability of BTC as a store of value...What happens to this analysis if the asset in question is in a bubble that has not yet popped?
1
If shrinkflation were an ongoing thing, we’d be buying negative amounts of things. ..Under your assumption of capitalism there companies should be paying us to buy shit. ..There a fundamental misunderstanding of economics in your comment. Again, inflation is higher than what’s reported, but prices are not doubling every 8 years. Even housing hasn’t done that (outside of a handful of locations)

1/ An SoV should hold or increase value against other asset classes (ie not depreciate). But you're gaslighting the very definition by asserting that the value has to remain constant, which is false. And I'm not a maxi of anything—I hold large quantities of fait, BTC, ETH, XMR, and real estate. I'm hedged and diversified because I was lucky enough to begin in 2011, and have a successful profession alongside. 'Moonlambo' dreams are for 18 year olds without life experience (or taste)...2/ Network effects in technology, finance, and business are also predicated on reaching a 'critical mass'. Yes, future markets are unpredictable—but there is a large distinction between an asset class broadly adopted within the wider financial world for a specific use-case (SoV), and protocols operating only in a relative (crypto-centric) vacuum...3/ 'The blockchain trilemma'. BTC prioritises security (hash) over scalability. That is the correct move for an SoV. And your fee example is hyperbole as a median example, which shows that your arguments aren't in good faith.
-4
True revolution takes time and buy in from a wide set of participants. It's why political revolutions and coup's often fail soon after occurring—vested interests and goals are not aligned sufficiently. The world isn't a set of binary actions and results—and you can't just press a button to replace one thing with another. That is true in finance and trade as much as it is true in society at large.
1
Meh—you're crying about not reaching 100k USD? That's herd mentality right there! It's value against other all assets (not just fiat) has performed flawlessly over a 15 year period but it's not 100k so failure? So dumb mate. But sure, stay on the delulu train!
2
1/ Like anything in the world, we as a society choose to value one thing over another—and that value determination becomes clearer over time. It's up to the collective to determine the winners and losers of an asset class. In that respect BTC is clearly the winner from the time scale that we available to us (ie from 2008 until today)...2/ Yes, exactly, and I've been a member on various alt accounts since the beginning. Free and open crypto discussion in a sub titled 'BTC'. This is a thread about BTC. No reason why you should get triggered about that. Again, what I'm writing is not controversial. All positions in this sub should be considered equally.

There are no stores of value. Only money, commodities, and labor. Money is merely a means to exchange labor for goods and services. So forget about this store of value nonsense.
0
More lulling for the masses. .Change always came from a enthusiastic and determined minority that was able to mobilise the masses. ..Every sentence of yours tries to immobilizing, I wonder why...
2
Wrong, I'm not crying I'm holding the mirror for you. ..>That's herd mentality right there!..Again a classic: accuse your opponent of what you are doing yourself. It's your camp that was promoting this fiercely...Still no reason for why BTC should be a good SoV. So you are trying to steer the discussion in a different direction.
3
> It's up to the collective to determine the winners and losers..So it has the valuation because bagholders speculating if they can find bigger bagholders for their dysfunctional, useless, slow and expensive shitcoin, got it...Fundamental value stems only from utility in money, or from economic activity/uses in assets/commodities. BTC has none of that, so it is actually worth nothing. Which is a very big discrepancy between its valuation. Reality has a way to correct these oversights eventually.
2
Because ‘trust me bro’? Two of your counter examples (money and commodities) ARE stores of value. The question is whether a store of value is good or bad over time relative to future purchasing power.
1
Pragmatism does not equate to immobilisation of ideas or action. You’re making the world binary again, go check out those shades of grey sometime. ..And the minority needs to win the hearts and interest of the masses if you truly want a revolution to succeed in the long-term (literally what I wrote above, which as per much of this conversation you seem to wilfully ignore).
1
1/ Looks great- thanks my friend 🍻..2/ I’m not your ‘opponent’, and I’m not part of any one camp. Maximalist ideology is always idiotic, that’s why I’ve always been part of multiple communities even when I disagree with other individuals. I’ve had all I have to say on BTC as an SoV, your choice to ignore or not engage with those answers is your own...And more fundamentally, as I wrote earlier- if you don’t want to use it then don’t. It’s nothing personal. Peace.

Who did you trust that planted this store of value nonsense in your head? Don't trust me, just use your brain, instead of blindly following people who are pulling you into their ponzi. Isn't it objectively true that money doesn't store value today? Inflation is insane, only a fool would try to store value with fiat money. Commodities will increase in value when inflation is continuous, again it's just common sense. But you're not storing value by holding commodities, you're simply hedging against inflation.
0
It's easy to hide one's numbness and efforts to stall behind pragmatism. ..I never made anything binary, I'm just calling you out. In every revolution the one appeasing to the system in charge are gaining the most until the revolution succeeds. It has always been like that...BTC pays well for its supporters to not promote sound p2p cash (most don't even realize what they are doing they just follow the hype). ..But in the end BTC is just another bump in the road. It's your choice to support BTC and its custodians vs all the other better options that will actually bring freedom and sovereignty.

Something that has zero utility derives its price purely from speculation about the influx of bigger fools. These things never end well.

It is not a SoV and it is barely decentralized. A SoV does not do Jo-Jo-prices, intraday crashes of 20% and 80-95% crashes every few years. With BSCore controlling everything and two pools holding 80% of the hashpower and the only way to „use“ it being KYC/AML exchanges or ETFs, the „decentralization“ is a joke. 99.99% of transactions are exchanges sending coins between them. All major forums/socials are completely censored, which is a fucking travesty for anything claiming to be decentralized...It isn’t that I don’t like it, it is that BTC is useless, crippled and extremely centralized by any measure. Nobody even uses it for SoV, because that isn’t what it is. Every single one of its „users“ holds it with $$$ signs in their eyes betting on a NgU 10-1000x where they get to dump their bags on even bigger fools. If BTC was nice and stable and just adjusted for inflation, it would already have crashed to cmc #1000+...Speculation isn’t inherently good or bad. But a purely speculative market with no underlying fundaments where everyone just bets 100% on the next bigger fool to come along is also objectively no good, very bad...> Where we go we don’t need utility, we live in the post-fundamentals age..— Maxis..> Wanna crash land?..— Reality...Things might look pretty nice historically… until they don’t. BTCs don’t moment is long overdue. It is just a store of future complete loss.

... and doesn't lose in value
2
However, if I need to use banks to use a money that banks tell me "doesn't lose value", I won't be convinced.....Value is subjective, and never constant, no matter what kind of money. Expecting something to never lose value, is entirely foolish imo. What people value most, changes over time...But you have a point that excessive volatility isn't good for something that's trying to be "money".
1
Value is subjective, that's true, but I'm more talking about inflation/deflation. Inflationary money will always lose value, deflationary money tend to increase in value, but of course there's other factors to take into consideration, the overall monetary system for example.
1
As long as inflation is kept low, people don't care about it. It's sad but true...They work their whole lives to find out the money they saved at the end is nearly worthless...Yet, they are still not angry enough about this to make a decisive change. Or maybe it's because they are now old and the young are still too stupid to realize.
1
Sounds like first world problems tbh, we're seeing this already in countries where currencies aren't kept alive by lies and politics. .What do you mean by "kept low"? .There is a constant money printing ongoing, inflation is never kept low, but always above 0, bitcoin fixes this.

Gambling is a tax on people bad at math, that said, someone has to win the lottery before others chance it. There are many people telling that story, but I don't think it's as believable today as it was 12 years ago. ..Being correct about the way sound money should go up in price, does not make BTC sound money.

That will happen the day that one million buys you just a car.

The collapse of the dollar will push us to over 1 million a coin.  I would say 25 years should be plenty of time.

Basically, the MATHS  :   ...For BTC to reach $1 million, given its limited supply, it would take such a MASSIVE market cap you know..... ....Don't dream and believe those "experts" analysts making their jobs ...

I would say this a massive chance by 2040. Nearly nailed on.

0.00000000000000000000000000000000000001%

There is a 100% chance fiat will trend to zero. Not a single example in history where this is not the case...Ergo the chance of any crypto valued in fiat reaching 1M "fiat" is 100% also.

BTC, Onecoin, Bitconnect, no big difference in the way you all promote it.

0.000000000001%..Some perfect storm huge political events must happen for this to be possible like several major countries like China legalizing it, then making it their official reserve currency and publicly saying that they will be buying it

Not in the lifetime of anyone now living.

100% just not sure when. It should reach 1MIL by 2035, if not more. BTC market is about to explode, hence blackrock simply collecting and whales moving to cold storage.

I spend 1-2 hours daily browsing news, news, and others sources of.. news...  .Globally, as a  summary, based on kinda "average number of articles saying the same" : ..  .they gloabally say BTC will oscillate between $50k-$60$-$70k until the end of the year...  .Longer time frame: Nobody knows for sure....   ..So many thnigs/events/... to come....

BTC has no purpose. OK, bring out your edge cases like some POS country with destroyed currencies. But in the main it doesn't solve any problem, which makes it a greater-fool speculation. I don't know of any examples where such a thing turns out well. But of course it will be different this time.
1
with inflation isn't it just a matter time?

100%..But the important question is how much worth is that $1mio by then

If you ask yourself that question, you probably should not be involved in crypto in the first place
2
100% with no black swan event
1
Ask that same question in. Years time and see how completely different the responses are...I remember people saying BTC would never in a million years reach 50k before thAr it was never 20k..Now it's never reaching 150k until it does
0
Very slim in our lifetimes. It would require a lot of things to happen in order for it to reach 1m. As in, total collapse of Fiat system which is not likely in our lifetime, total adoption of crypto as a whole with Bitcoin being something like a gold standard or store of value of some kind. Which by the point of a total Fiat collapse we would likely be in some sort of global war for resources instead of trying to fix it, because you know humans are dumb like that. If I remember correctly it would have to 30x from here to hit 1m, So I'd give it a hefty 1%. Anyways, in conclusion I got the Barbie cup from McDonald's today for their new collectors cup promotion.

The chance is not 100% and you know it. BTCers like to make everyone believe that when the dollar collapses BTC will stay valuable and therefore is a sure things to reach fantastillions. But there is nothing that connects one event with the other...Edit:..Here are just a few things why BTC would crash too:..- If the dollar collapse exchanges go down too triggering a frenzy to get out..- If the dollar collapses and your internet service gets spotty again triggering a frenzy got get value into something usefull..- If the dollar collapses old SoVs will be king, Gold, tabbaco, Booze, Gas. Everything that is useful is suddenly way more interesting than magic internet settlement layer.

**The fact that it literally shits itself under minimal transaction demand, making it non-viable for any sort of real world economic activity.**..Please educate yourself, read the book 'Hijacking Bitcoin'.
10
Bitcoin is solid, BTC with its transaction limit is unsustainable...Sound money is an honest accounting system for value exchange. Transitioning from fiat to sound money will create the greatest wealth transfer in history...BTC has an artificial transaction limit that is a result of social manipulation, censoring the truth, when you force people to out bid each other for the privilege of exchanging value (limiting it to 1MB of transaction data) commerce and wealth creation is impeded...MV=PT. BTC limits M and T - the net result is only the mega wealthy could use it, so grassroots adoption will prevent the demand that is needed to drive up the value of the network.

I was born in East Germany before the wall came down. Please express to me the value of BTC in DDM. Please express the value of BTC in Turkish Lira before the currency reform of 2005 (or now). Maybe you want to try Ugandan Shilling?..The average life span of a state issued currency is 26 years. Then they become worthless...The oldest fiat currency in use is the GBP & since its introduction, it lost over 99.5% of its value...Give me one good reason the US dollar (or any fiat currency) will escape this fate...  .The essence: **You cannot measure value in a unit that has no cost.** If it has no cost, it has no value. Any unit that has a cost will be more valuable than a unit that has no cost.

See still caught in that fallacy. Just because most FIATs go to zero doesn't mean BTC goes to infinity. ...You imply that everyone can get insanely rich with BTC because that is its only selling point left but that is not the case if the dollar goes to zero BTC might be 1million but still only buy you a car. ..It's falls marketing. And as I said it is more likely that they will safe the dollar somehow by going into CBDCs or kill Bitcoin to push CBDcs before BTC reaches 1million$

Dude, there are like 2 new topics a day and your stupid stuff is something someone has to refute...Keep believing, its still wrong though, someone once believed he could fly. Also, see my edit.

It's not an educational problem. BTC has been crippled but the marketing campaign rolled on. You and 99% of the world will not be able to transact on BTC self-custodial in any way. You won't even be able to open your LN channel self custodial. ..You can check that yourself easily:..7 transaction per second..8 billion people
7
Limiting transaction capacity limits the number of users...If BTC went to $1,000,000 most people wouldn't be able to effort to have $10,000 in Bitcoin so they'd need to trust institutions like banks to hold it for them, and they won't have any way of verifying its real BTC, they will need to trust an entity like the FED to regulate the banks. ..And just like gold backing paper money was abused, on chain BTC backing mouse click money will be abused.

The book is full of sources and even if you don't agree you should read it to understand what happend, because much of it was censored and is still not spoken about in the BTC camp.

So you haven't read the book but you have a strong opinion...the mark of the idiot.

a quick peek at the profile seemed to indicate otherwise, so i felt sorry for them.

No, I'm not implying BTC will make you rich. I'm implying fiat will make you poor...I don't say 1 BTC will afford a house. I say 1M USD will not afford a house.

User name fits you. Never could you exchange the currency of the German Democratic Republic directly to Euro. By the time the EUR was introduced, DDM was not even excepted by the central banks anymore.

That's a nice opinion

I understand your objection but you are comparing bitcoin to other cryptos.  Compared to gold, Bitcoin offers faster transactions, lower dilution rates, and greater portability.  I have no interest in regular btc transactions as I view it as a store of value and don't want to pay capital gains tax to buy a cup of coffee.

If Bitcoin were to reach $1,000,000 per BTC, it's likely that the Bitcoin ecosystem would adapt. The high value should lead to more innovative ways to make Bitcoin accessible to a broader audience.

Are ad hominem attacks a sign of high intelligence?  .  .I don't have a strong opinion of the book because I haven't read it.  I have a strong opinion on bitcoin because I have read extensively about it ("the bitcoin standard", "the fiat standard", "principles of economics", "broken money", "fiat food", "gradually, the suddenly", "mastering bitcoin", "bitcoin is venice"), I've read the white paper and the source code.  .  .I can't possibly understand bitcoin without one particular book?

Reddit is very hostile to new users, which sucks and the karma mechanic is one of them. r/btc allows much lower karma accounts to post then most other subs. .And yes, benefit of the doubt. But if you stay here long enough you will see them, too. And they get harder to spot each year.

Then add a disclaimer.

\^\^This guy gets it.  The amount of people who haven't done 5 hours of  research but talk like they fully understand BTC is shocking.  Do your homework.  BTC will preserve your economic energy.  The dollar will not.  Simple.

Dude, half my family is german...> On January 1, 1999, the Euro was introduced as an electronic currency for banking and financial transactions, while national currencies, including the Deutsche Mark, continued to be used for cash transactions. The exchange rate was fixed at 1 Euro = 1.95583 Deutsche Marks. This rate was based on the average value of the DM in the foreign exchange markets leading up to the conversion...My username is about people like you.

Imagine you store your value in Gold, but only the top 1% can move their Gold once every 100 days and moving is made so expensive that only they can afford it. Would anyone store their value in Gold?..No you wouldn't because you couldn't even move it to a bank or merchant to sell it when you need it. And good luck selling your paper wallet to someone. Because they have the same problem. They need to move it because you know the seed, but they also have to be in the top 1% to pay the fees to move it into another wallet....Edit:..Btw, this:..>I understand your objection but you are comparing bitcoin to other cryptos...is just a marketing trick to sell you BTC. BTC is one of the worst cryptos, but is has great branding.
10
LOL, it's not a complaint, it's the reality that prevents $1,000,000 BTC. ..Money tends to accumulate with those who manage it best. ..I encourage you to buy more BTC (not financial advice) if you can't see the issue.
2
OK, but I can't see how crippling adoption and use (the egg) leads to the $1,000,000 (chicken)..I'm all into being proven wrong.

> The high value should lead to more innovative ways to make Bitcoin accessible to a broader audience....What's more accessible than an IOU on 'Bank of Coinbase' the common man gets ..* Exposure to a hard asset ..* Can **ask** permission to transact for almost zero '*monetary*' cost (too bad if their trade partner is '*persona non grata*'...Good luck waiting for another Satoshi level breakthrough to allow trustless layer 2 solutions

High base layer fees are **by design** and will be prohibitive in a world where the Bitcoin rich are throwing around multi million dollar transactions (**just** 10% of daily swift volume).....What does your understanding from PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC say blockspace will be worth when the worlds 60 million millionaires start bidding for their **single bi annual transaction**, will the common man be able to compete?....>  I have read extensively about it ("the bitcoin standard", "the fiat standard", "principles of economics", "broken money", "fiat food", "gradually, the suddenly", "mastering bitcoin", "bitcoin is venice")...None of those txts address the central '**computer science**' problem...* There is no known way (on BTC) to have a non custodial 2nd layer that doesn't **require** an anchor into the base layer **which would require an on chain fee** (more explicitly the ability to have trustless presence on L2 **without** requiring a L1 anchor <==> on chain fee)...You say you have read the source code, can you explain why you think the above is incorrect?

It's not homework, it is a cult like believe system. The most likely outcome is that in a dollar collapse every high risk asset will fall just as fast and old time SoVs will be the once people are looking for and what will weather the collapse.

DDM ≠ DEM (or DM)..If you don't know the ISO code of a currency, look it up *before* talking about it...DDM stopped being used 1990 when Germany reunited.

It's funny you guys keep downvoting me and keep engaging...Transaction fees are not fixed and can vary widely based on network demand.  I don't know of anyone that is attempting to move their long-term store of value assets regularly.  This is the case for gold, real estate, collectables etc.  We are just seeing layer 2 solutions reach the market and these solutions will continue to evolve and expand...Ultimately, while Bitcoin has limitations, it also has unique attributes that differentiate it from both traditional and other digital assets. The ongoing development and integration of new technologies may help address some of the current constraints...You mention marketing and branding on bitcoin.  Bitcoin's fair launch, decentralized nature, and transparent supply model distinguish it from many cryptocurrencies with large pre-mines, changes in issuance rates, large developer communities, and industry partnerships.
1
While a $1 million Bitcoin could lead to higher transaction fees on the main chain, it wouldn’t prevent self-custodial transactions. Layer 2 solutions and the ability to transact in smaller units would continue to support self-custody...I agree that "money tends to accumulate with those who manage it best", but perfection is the enemy of good.  Currently, about of quarter of the world's population is unbanked.  30% of the US own zero appreciating assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) and are being bled to death by inflation.  Would these people be better off saving in btc?
1
>I've read the white paper and the source code...Huh?
2
Don't play dumb. You can ask 100 people and 99 of them will tell you "BTC to 1M" means they will be rich because 99% don't expect a dollar collapse or even see it in that statement. And you know that and use it.
2
It's a belief system informed by history, logic and math.  Buy gold if that feels safer to you but if you want to argue against bitcoin, bring something to the table that isn't an opinion...The properties of bitcoin that give it a competitive advantage are:  .  .decentralized  .permissionless  .durable and portable  .fungible and divisible  .secure and anti-fragile  .censorship-resistant  .scarce with a fixed supply..Society will converge on the best form of money overtime.  Cowrie shells were widely used as money in Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean region due to their durability and ease of handling.  Gold replaced silver and other metals as the primary form of money because it was more scare, more durable and it's higher density and value allowed more wealth to be stored in a smaller volume.   .  .During the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1923, Germans tried to preserve their wealth as the value of the Papiermark plummeted by purchasing tangible assets, bartering and moving into foreign currencies.  This happened because they moved off the Goldmark.
2
I'm not sure the premise is understood. A dollar collapse means it would rapidly go to zero value. That means *everything* will rise in price if measured in dollar...If the price denominator of anything (food, petrol, crypto) is worth close to nothing, one needs close to infinity of it to buy anything (food, petrol, crypto)...Dollar collapse = even harder crypto collapse is where I believe you are wrong. If somebody realizes the dollar is failing, why would he/she exchange crypto for that failing dollar?
1
> With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, the East German Mark was replaced by the Deutsche Mark (DM), the currency of West Germany. The conversion rate was initially set at 1:1 for wages, salaries, and pensions, and 2:1 for larger sums of money...Nice try.
2
BTC's unique attribute is the network effect. Any honest ledger with Bitcoin's design will outperform BTC with a similar network effect.
5
FYI I didn't downvote your last few message, but you get downvoted because you are utterly wrong and stuck in the believe system that is repeated ad nauseum at BTC...>Transaction fees are not fixed and can vary widely based on network demand..This for example. Yes fees can vary, but if you see them in the light of the artificially restricted throughput you realize 99% of all people will be priced out. So no matter what fees are you will be priced out by the 1% And this is only calculated with people not blackrock and banks etc. ..Let me say it again: YOU WONT BE ABLE TO USE L1 EVER AGAIN IF THE 1% ADOPT BTC...>Ultimately, while Bitcoin has limitations, it also has unique attributes that differentiate it from both traditional and other digital assets..That's marketing, because every other crypto have that, too, but the marketing made you believe BTC is special. ..>The ongoing development and integration of new technologies may help address some of the current constraints...No it won't if you took of the rose-colored glasses you would see it. 8 years of LN development and the thing is a unworkable mess. All that Segwit an Taproot brought you was Jepegs onchain. There is a reason Big blockers forked, BTC is captured. All the new rebels will realize that too, when nothing of their Op_Cat op_ctv drivechaisn etc. makes it into code after years and years of bickering.....>You mention marketing and branding on bitcoin. Bitcoin's fair launch, decentralized nature, and transparent supply model distinguish it from many cryptocurrencies with large pre-mines, changes in issuance rates, large developer communities, and industry partnerships...Maybe from 90% of the coins, but all it needs is one coin that is better and BTC is done for. And when you drive with the handbrake on chances are good someone will overturn you.

They would be better off with plan B - Bitcoin if it takes off.

Where did you get that quote from? Certainly not from my comment.

>It's a belief system informed by history, logic and math...It's not otherwise you wouldn't bet on BTC...History:..BTC is only 15 years old..Logic: BTC is crippled and captured and won't do what you think and been told it does...Math:..Easy to check: 7 transactions per second 8 Billion people....>Society will converge on the best form of money overtime..Yes and that is why they wont converge on BTC it isn't the best money anymore. But what will likely happen now that it is captured and the elites got in is, people will be told to get in but of course only via these safe custodians. It's already happening....>Gold replaced silver and other metals as the primary form of money because it was more scare, more durable and it's higher density and value allowed more wealth to be stored in a smaller volume...During the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1923, Germans tried to preserve their wealth as the value of the Papiermark plummeted by purchasing tangible assets, bartering and moving into foreign currencies. This happened because they moved off the Goldmark...You described the reason perfectly why people won't go for BTC when the shit hits the fan.

Because for everyone but a small circle of zealots BTC is a very high risk gambling asset and as soon as shit hits the fan they will try to sell it for something with a history of safety. And by history I mean hundreds of years not 15 years.

>DDM was directly converted to EURO, \[...\]...False. Can you admit that? I think that would a strong move.

Bitcoin is an honest ledger with bitcoin's design so I'm not sure what quality you are trying to distinguish.  .  .Even if it wasn't, creating an 'honest ledger' with bitcoin's design isn't just a matter of copying the code. It requires replicating the vast, global network of miners, nodes, developers, and users. Achieving a similar network effect would be extremely challenging because Bitcoin's first-mover advantage, brand recognition, and integration into financial systems are difficult to replicate.

BTC doesn't have network effect, it has FOMO.

>Something is going to break because that statement is true, but my take is that Injustice will allow charismatic politicians to blame the other guy for the resulting poverty, and we get war and reset the system and start again...I think that is a reasonable take.  The CDBC reset is already planned. WEF has spelled it out clearly and in detail.  BlackRock has plans to eat the world...I think we mostly agree about our current reality, we just differ on the best path forward and not by much...It made me think of:..>These \[fat\] cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain,  .\[the rest of us are\] slaves on a ship talking about who’s got the flyest chain..>Talib Kweli

During fiat collapse, fiat is the only gamble...I hear what you are saying, It is a young & volatile asset and its future is all but certain...But in the event of shit hitting the fan in your neighborhood, do you really want to flee with gold under your arms? Will banks give you your value when you want it? Even if your government needs it for fighter jets & submarines & missiles? I think your value will be confiscated via executive order whenever shit truly does hit the fan. It will be even easier than Executive Order 6102 in 1933...Meanwhile someone who takes crypto seriously can create transactions offline & transmit them to a decentralized network by any means, even on radio waves. If you are in a situation of chaos, you'd want your value as close to you as possible in an inconspicuous way. I try to imagine if I needed to run (because shit hit the fan) with my value, what would be a good option? Not all in crypto but it would be a big part of it.

Yes, I mistook it for the deutsch mark as my family is from western germany. Makes no difference to my point:..> With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, the East German Mark was replaced by the Deutsche Mark (DM), the currency of West Germany. The conversion rate was initially set at 1:1 for wages, salaries, and pensions, and 2:1 for larger sums of money.

Bitcoin is an economic incentive design. Satoshi explained how it grows with momentum...The adoption and infrastructure subsidy (incentive part of the design) is 94.002% spent. It looks like only laggards buying in now...> I'm not sure what quality you are trying to distinguish...BTC is an honest ledger, It's not Satoshi's Bitcoin design as described in the Bitcoin White Paper, or in Satoshi's writings. Freedom of excretion is limited in BTC, and not with Bitcoin,..Basically, users can't interact without friction, and friction increases with use, regulating and limiting adoption, so it can't scale as designed without wide spread use and adoption...The last 6% of the adoption subsidy is not enough to secure large value on chain without a relatively pegged security budget for miners, which would typically be paid through economies of scale lots of low paying fees to compensate for the diminishing subsidy...as some BTC maxsies start to realize this, they're going to see Todd's tail emissions schema as a solution.

You must have edited your comment...What does the whitepaper talk about?

It was going until you bailed out. I never once mentioned BitcoinCash. We were talking about BTC.

Even if your government needs it for fighter jets & submarines & missiles? I think your value will be confiscated via executive order whenever shit truly does hit the fan. It will be even easier than Executive Order 6102 in 1933...You argue like BTC works as self custodial p2p cash, but it doesn't anymore. Are you one of the top 1% that can afford to transact onchain? Odds have it, you are not and you will be a custodial sucker like 95% of the LN users are already today. How do you think you will get anything for your BTC when an onchain tx cost 1000$?..>Meanwhile someone who takes crypto seriously can create transactions offline & transmit them to a decentralized network by any means, even on radio waves.

I try to imagine if I needed to run (because shit hit the fan) with my value, what would be a good option? Not all in crypto but it would be a big part of it...The scenario your are envisioning will make ANYTHING digital worthless. It is interesting that it is almost always the same kind of people that are gambling on BTC.
1
What exactly is the point?..As a reminder: I wanted to know how many DDM a Bitcoin would cost today...I believe no amount would suffice. Nobody would send you a BTC even if you offered a billion DDM. This speaks to the point of all fiat trending to zero. Monetary reforms usually expedite this process because they often coincide with higher than usual inflation...It is simple math. If we agree that fiat trends to zero value in the long run, then the value of everything else (a meal, a phone, a digital asset) will go to the millions if it is expressed in that fiat currency...It's like asking how many centimeters are in a meter while centimeters keep getting shorter & shorter with time.
1
I would say that your concern about the remaining subsidy and its impact on network security and adoption is valid but speculative and you are stating it as fact.
1
It would say "edited" if I had edited it...I just edited this to add:..the whitepaper describes a method for enabling direct peer-to-peer online payments without relying on financial institutions
1
I said crypto, not BTC. I don't say p2p cash, I speak of an option to have portable value in self custody...Yes, I could afford the $1-3 it costs to do a BTC transaction. I prefer other digital assets for everyday purchases...How does something digital become worthless if you need to move quick? Kindly explain what you mean here.
1
I'll help you. You raised this point:..> There is a 100% chance fiat will trend to zero. Not a single example in history where this is not the case...> Ergo the chance of any crypto valued in fiat reaching 1M "fiat" is 100% also...and later brought up DDM implying that it collapsed to 0...Besides that your whole premise is idiotic, DDM was replaced by the deutsch mark, then later the EUR.
1
OK, here's how the designer described that aspect of the design with more certainty than me. ..[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/x9o8ud/satoshi\_2010\_im\_sure\_that\_in\_20\_years\_there\_will/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/x9o8ud/satoshi_2010_im_sure_that_in_20_years_there_will/)..FYI I used to think Satoshi was wrong on quite a bit, but I've learned he mostly got it correct.

MV=PT that part is fact. ..P Price in a transaction goes up to accommodate for V velocity needed to justify the value of money. Transaction fees go up to accommodate the limit in T Transactions. The rest is clockwork, other than the PR and marketing narratives.
1
> the whitepaper describes a method for enabling direct peer-to-peer online payments without relying on financial institutions..How does that sentence relate to the narrative of BTC shitcoiners today?
2
1mb blocks just push more people towards relying on financial institutions. and we all know financial institutions always bend the rules in their favour and even when they lose they blackmail the government to bail them out under the threat of a "financial collapse". This is the issue that will only get worse the more people pile on thinking BTC is the answer to all their problems. it will become more and more expensive to transact and rob the poors of their own financial sovereignty by using the blockchain directly, thus pushing everyone like cattle back into the existing broken system. If you do not hold your keys, you do not hold your coins. This is just as true today as it was when bitcoin was first invented. "**peer** to **peer** electronic cash system"
1
>I said crypto, not BTC..So you failed the topic, because everyone here is talking about BTC. But I agree somewhat on other cryptocurrencies, but not completely. There are no safe heaven without widespread MoE adoption...> I speak of an option to have portable value in self custody. .You don't have a portable value in self-custody without the ability to send it self custodial aka p2p-cash once you understand this BTC is dead coin for you. ..>Yes, I could afford the $1-3 it costs to do a BTC transaction...Your arguing from a anecdotal evidence standpoint. Here is the math standpoint: 7tx means the top 1% can make a single self-custodial tx every 100 days and no one else will be able to make any tx on BTC. Which means your whole premise is gone...It's like saying if everyone could just charter their private jets the world would be a better place. ...>How does something digital become worthless if you need to move quick? Kindly explain what you mean here...Easy example: You have a paper wallet with 1BTC. The coins are on 10 addresses the rich have adopted BTC. A tx  cost 0.1 BTC. To move your 10 coins would cost you 1BTC. So you can't move it. You can't sell it, because the buyer has the same problem AND he needs to move them out of the seed because you know it. So your coins are effectively worthless. ..During the last high fee event something like 82% of all addresses were dust.
1
I did not say or imply that it collapsed. Only that it is worthless now...There are many reasons fiat becomes worthless & hyperinflation accounts for only about a quarter of them. This list is actually quite interesting: [https://www.bitrawr.com/demonetized-currencies](https://www.bitrawr.com/demonetized-currencies)..The premise is that all fiat becomes worthless with time. The only fiat that goes against this trend is a very old car. :D..Jokes aside, you can call this premise idiotic if you can name one fiat currency that does not lose purchasing power.

I don't subscribe to classical economic theory.  While the MV = PT equation from classical economics suggests a direct relationship between money supply and price levels, Austrian economics emphasizes the complex, subjective, and non-uniform effects of changes in the money supply on the economy, challenging the simplistic and mechanistic view presented by the Quantity Theory of Money...Austrian economists argue that the concept of the velocity of money is not a constant or even a meaningful variable in the same way it is treated in the Quantity Theory of Money. Velocity is a result of human actions, which are influenced by many factors beyond the money supply...Austrian economics emphasizes that value is subjective and determined by individual preferences. This contrasts with the classical view that money supply changes automatically translate into price changes. Prices are the result of subjective valuations of goods and services by individuals in the market, not merely a mechanical result of changes in M...I know John Stuart Mill and the like would consider MV=PT as a fact but there are other competing schools of thought.  You might want to check out "Man, Economy, and State" by Murray Rothbard for a comprehensive overview.

Investors in bitcoin ETFs, should understand the risks, including the potential for government intervention or the possibility of losing access to their assets if they don't hold their private keys. The institutions and wealthy individuals participating in these ETFs are fully aware of these risks and are making a calculated decision to trust these financial products...As for government bailouts, ETFs are settled in dollars, not Bitcoin.   The risk of government seizure, like what happened with gold in the past, is a real concern, but it’s a different issue from the one related to block size and transaction costs...Ultimately, it comes down to personal responsibility. If individuals prefer to hold their own Bitcoin and avoid the risks associated with financial institutions and ETFs, they can do so by managing their private keys and transacting directly on the blockchain...What you big blockers seem to forget is the market decided which block size it prefers.  This is the most fair way we can determine winners and losers, market participants choose.  What happens to the size of the bitcoin cash blockchain over time with comparable transaction volume to bitcoin?

In my very first comment I expanded the conversation to any crypto. This is still the same thread. You keep dragging us back to that asset, including now...You said "anything digital" would be worthless. Even capitalized it. You can't dismiss every other digital asset with the same old "BTC is crippled" argument. But you said you "agree somewhat on other cryptocurrencies", so I guess this is the best place to end the discussion...We may not agree on everything but I still enjoyed the talk.

Do you suffer from CTE?

Quantity Theory of Money is a theory, like evolution is a theory. It's not a classical economic theory, and it is consistent with the Cantillon Effect and other Austrian Economic "Theories". The Quantity of Money Theory preserves human action a subjective, and non-uniform effects of changes in price due to economy action...The Quantity Theory of Money is a more Austrian idea than it is a classical economic idea. It's used to prove monetary inflation causes price inflation when all being equal, and it describes why monetary inflation does not always result in price inflation, used as a tool to justify monetary inflation...Just ignore it if you can see how useful it is in understanding Bitcoin...Murray Rothbard ideas clash with those of the Monetarists not because MV=PT is practically a fact, but because Monetarists believe you can manage an economy while Austrians believe you can't for the reasons you quoted, and I reiterated, in that human action is a non-uniform effects in the economy...BTC is no longer a free market monetary phenomenon, it's a narrative managed by Core Developers, the gatekeepers of the protocol, that has now been altered to suite the existing hegemony, so hardly an Austrian / Liberian idea in its current carnation...In fact, the native is so strong it has people believing BTC is not money (digital cash) but a SoV, BTC's SoV value is believed to only have value because the "M" Quantity is fixed, and ignores price is driven by the network effect growing due to FOMO.

>You said "anything digital" would be worthless. Even capitalized it. You can't dismiss every other digital asset with the same old "BTC is crippled" argument. But you said you "agree somewhat on other cryptocurrencies", so I guess this is the best place to end the discussion...That was a response to your "everything is fucked, its chaos etc" comment. If you think WW3, which is what is usually brought up at this point, digital assets will be all worthless. Imo a dollar collapse will be close to WW3. ..If you thought smaller like a single country collapsing then I agree with you some digital assets can hold their value. All my answers were specifically for BTC though, since that was the topic to begin with.

No. Can you refute my premise with an example?

This is simply not factual:..>The dynamic Wicksellian, Austrian, and Keynesian models stand in contrast to the static Fisherian model. Unlike the monetarists, adherents to the later models don't advocate a stable price level in monetary policy. -investopia..The Quantity Theory of Money *is* considered a classical economic theory. It dates back to the classical economists of the 16th and 17th centuries, such as John Locke and David Hume, and was later formalized by economists like Irving Fisher and Milton Friedman. It is a central part of classical and neoclassical economics, which emphasize the long-term effects of monetary policy on price levels.  .  .It is not in direct conflict with the Cantillon Effect, but they address different aspects of how money impacts the economy.  .  .Austrian economists often critique QTM for its simplicity, but they share a common concern about the dangers of inflation and monetary expansion...Honestly, this is getting tiring for me.  I get that we have different world views.  I appreciate you have kept it civil and have been open to a discussion but I don't think we can take it any further.  We will know who was correct soon enough.  Best of luck.

Title: I found a old paper wallet with some btc
2
So what did you find if you didn’t find the words?
12
Older paper wallets had a single private key (along with an address) instead of a mnemonic phrase. If that is the kind of paper wallet you have, then you can redeem it by importing the private key into electrum.
6
of course there is a chance, minuscule though it may be. But realistically, no.
3
You either found a way to access it or you found nothing. What's a paper wallet good for when you don't have the access keys on it?
5
check the public address in a bitcoin explorer and dont reply to DM
2
its 12 words but a paper wallet is a piece of paper with 12 words on it. If you don't have the words you have no wallet. ..If words are missing some can be recovered with varying degrees on complexity depending on whether word order, location of missing words etc is known or not.

The wallet is a piece of paper with 12 words on it, so what did you find?

This should be the top answer.

Every coin has a private key and a public key, that's what a key pair is . Not just your coins but that's how encryption works. Wtf.. the phrase words are another layer , electrum had a cool app idea. Even idiots like us can memorize a dozen words! to the private key. The public private key pair has nothing to do with if it's printed on actual paper. OP, if this paper wallet has two qr codes on it scan them. One is the public key the other is the private key. You need both to 'move' your coins. Y'all prolly know that but just in case for newcomers.

Absolutely! The inception of cryptocurrency was more than just a technological breakthrough; it was a revolutionary idea aimed at democratizing financial power. It's designed to offer an alternative to traditional banking systems, emphasizing transparency, security, and independence from centralized authorities. This vision of a decentralized financial future is what makes crypto not just innovative but vital for the continued pursuit of financial autonomy and privacy. Let's keep spreading the word and educating others about the true essence and potential of crypto!

Title: BCH The Big Block King -> Handling more transactions than everything waiting on BTC.
21
Those big blocks spoil all the fun...There is no rush like seeing that first confirmation drop after you cheap out on fees and everybody tells you it won't work!

Where are you mining bch?
1
the Big Block King's average block size for the last 7 days was 289.24kb lol
-11
I'm not mining, this was just a snap shot from my node.
1
That is better than 80% of transactions never happening after being submitted to the chain and a user walking away from the coin everytime it happens.
18
What will you do when this last narrative of "BTC is more used" also breaks like all the others did?..BTC cannot gain any lead because it is forever crippled. BCH only needs to gain no matter how slow and it will surpass BTC and then what? Will you finally admit that BTC doesn't cut it?
9
Not sure what the point is there, surely that keeps all the small blockers happy as the block size is low.
11
Okay thanks
1
I'm waiting for years for BCH usage to pick up and pump out 10 or 20mb blocks constantly so one can observe how nodes will handle huge UTXO sets, real world orphan numbers, etc. pp. ..But it simply does not happen and I honestly don't understand why. At these prices people could back up their music collections or pdfs for cents to the chain but somehoew no one does it except one user which emits a burst of transaction which form a few big consecutive blocks every few days only to fall back to 50tx micro blocks :/
-2
My point was that your statement of "Handling more transactions than everything waiting on BTC." is clealy false as there are simply not many transactions happening on bch
-6
And while you wait you conveniently try to throw sticks into the efforts of BitcoinCash doing just that...I don't believe you one bit. You're just another Dollar Maxi betting on BTC with no interest in p2p cash.

edit: disregard, see below

Yeah my statement is correct, at the time of that screenshot BTC had about 2k transactions in the block and 113k waiting to get in a block. BCH just did more transactions in 1 block that everything waiting on BTC currently.

It's not really cheap. Median fee right now is 0.00000001 BCH/byte ~ 0.01 BCH/MB ~ 3.4 USD/MB..Gonna cost thousands of dollars to back up a music collection.

the classic way to do it is using chained transactions with 220byte payload in op\_return, but one coud adapt the stamps protocol [https://github.com/mikeinspace/stamps](https://github.com/mikeinspace/stamps) to BCH and make payload chunks bigger per tx and unpruneable

More strawmanning about the example I gave being my "favorite website" and then purposefully leaving out the other half of my claim in an attempt to make it appear ridiculous? I'd expect nothing less, but you just made another mistake...If the Bitcoin Cash screenshot was from your "block explorer of choice" then why didn't you also use it for showing the Bitcoin BTC blocks?

dude stop it, this is embarrassing...the first link was to johos website showing the current bitcoin **mempool**, the second was a block explorer showing **blocks**. Different things.

According to your "block explorer of choice" it shows, unless I'm reading it wrong, there to be ~1,344,900 Bitcoin BTC tx currently in the mempool: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/mempool/transactions..For the sake of your original argument, that number being more than 5x Johos count would have worked even better, and it's also on your block explorer of choice!..Why didn't you just use that website for both?

Lawyers gotta earn a living somehow /s
1
I don't believe this.
1
The vast majorly of those people had a chance to settle for 13% at 2022 USD value, it’s just that they chose to take it to court to litigate and now Celsius are going after max pain. Tbh- the clawback itself is fine, to use a simple analogy the ‘robbery’ in Celsius had already occurred prior to the 90 day period- so clawbacks just share this common loss across all creditors. This isn’t a specific situation related to crypto/Celsius. Personally I think that people are idiots for not taking the 13%, it’s a way smaller haircut than other creditors got relative to the USD value and it’s more or less breakeven relative to having to pay legal expenses by going to court.
1
The people who laughed and ignored the first deal are being punished now with expensive attorney fees and will end up paying more. They're acting like this is so unfair and it hurts the entire crypto industry. Clawbacks are nothing new.
1
It's unfortunately real. This is actually happening to thousands of retail users. It's sad really, I am sure a lot of these users weren't seasoned crypto users, and this is how they're welcomed into the industry.
7
Agreed, Especially if you deposited the BTC on that exchange, then withdrew it. I can imagine suing for profits you earned due to their bad business decisions. I can't imagine them winning that given what we know about their bankruptcy.
3
As a simultaneous Celsius creditor, debtor, and preference exposure (clawback) party, I can attest to the process being pretty tricky, but more or less by the book of the law. .  .Right before the committee filed these clawbacks in court they sent a VERY scary email that anybody who read couldn’t possibly consider to be a bluff. And they pushed the 13.5% settlement (marked to market on date of withdrawal in USD) deadline multiple times before resorting to threats. .  .Also, the committee is a bunch of creditors themselves. They communicated well about why the clawbacks were fair and frankly it was enough to convince me to pay it off rather than go to court. .  .I feel badly for anybody that’s now dealing with the state of New York, but this wasn’t exactly unexpected. Good luck to anybody in that boat.
5
Its not like they refund deposits for the last 90 days though, so why claw back? Its not fair or just, its a random rule.
2
naw, clawbacks on withdraws are ridiculous. At the point they process your withdraw, they agreed to service you, there is no taksies backsies, if they are now liable for how they conducted business, that liability bucket stops with them.
6
The amount of withdrawals FAR exceeded deposits in those 90 days, that was covered in court filings. And those with accidental deposits after the bankruptcy filing date were refunded in full. And to be clearer the ‘robbery’ of the estate started well before the 90 day period (it’s just that clawbacks only extend that far) and continued right until the time of bankruptcy. ..Clawbacks aren’t a random rule- they’re part of bankruptcy process. It creates a fairer distribution of the loses incurred. Every creditor has something to complain about, because there was a huge collective loss of assets- the guy in the article is no different to any other creditor in that sense.
2
I agree with you intuitively. But at this point it’s not about the company that went bankrupt, it’s about how the US courts treat bankruptcy. .  .My memory is a bit foggy (feel free to correct my numbers, but you’ll get the gist), but I think the original hole was something like $2B, with $11B in liabilities and $9B in assets. .  .If the company had operated honestly, at that point they should have halted withdrawals and declared bankruptcy, in which case everybody would have gotten back ~82% of their claim. .    .Because they were crooks, they tried to keep it on the rails and only shut the doors once most people had ran for the exit. Anybody who didn’t get their money out in time was then looking at only getting back ~20%. .  .The courts call clawbacks withdrawal preference exposure because the people who got out received a “preference” over those who didn’t. I’m not saying that I agree with the law or what you criticize about fairness and terms of service. But learning all this did at least help me understand why these rules exist at all. .  .In the case of Bernie Madoff I believe clawbacks allowed all creditors to receive 100% of their money back in the end (not counting the phony growth that BM lied about. YMMV
2
I agree. This is simply another reason why you need to hold the coins yourself. anything less is an unnecessary risk. And fuck celsius for going bankrupt in the first place. shit ass company.
1
So the smart/aware creditors should be penalized to support the slow ones? How is that fair? If that's the case, the bankruptcy code is the one that should be changed, because whoever made it seems to have a poor sense of what's fair.
0
Exchange clawbacks are a very, super duper, no good, here be dragons idiotic idea. This isn’t about making things fair. Next time you withdraw from an exchange, you need to park those funds for 10 years lest they attempt to claw it back from you because they fucked up in the meantime and ride you into debt up to your eyeballs. Good luck.
3
Yep- this is a great breakdown. There’s a lot of shoot from the hip emotion from people who haven’t been privy to the process- but ultimately it’s been a really complicated one, with many groups of victims. There’s no perfect solution to making things ‘fair’ but in the end the legal process has moved it into a fairer place than from where we started.

ChatGPT is a language model. I'd take this with a grain of salt no matter how badly we want companies to buy Bitcoin. ChatGPT has no idea what it's talking about and the rationale behind it.

> Ask it the likelihood that the Black Mesa corporation will buy up the world’s supply of MacGuffins..GPT-4o..> The scenario of the Black Mesa corporation buying up the world’s supply of MacGuffins seems to be a playful reference, likely rooted in the fictional universe of the Half-Life video game series or a related context. Black Mesa is a fictional research corporation in the Half-Life series, and MacGuffins are plot devices in fiction, often items that drive the story forward but have little intrinsic importance themselves..>.> In a real-world context, the likelihood of any corporation buying up a "world’s supply" of something that behaves like a MacGuffin (i.e., something of vague or undefined importance) is extremely low. Companies typically invest in acquiring or monopolizing tangible assets, commodities, or intellectual properties that have a clear strategic value..>.> However, if we are considering this within a fictional or speculative context, the "likelihood" depends entirely on the narrative being crafted. In the world of fiction, anything is possible, especially if it serves the story!.>.> So, while the idea is entertaining, it's important to remember it's rooted in fiction rather than reality.

It's a chat relay bot that isn't allowed to use the "intelligence" part of the AI marketing.

from the article byline:..>"Ted Cruz advocates for Bitcoin as a critical energy reserve for Texas, highlighting its potential to bolster the state's grid during emergencies."..He is saying that extra electrical infrastructure will be built in Texas to support the growing bitcoin mine industry there, and during emergencies, such as unusual weather events, this can be leveraged to provide sufficient power where/when it's needed. If you're mining in that state, and a big snowstorm blows over, then you might be asked (or forced) to temporarily shut down so people can heat their homes.

> The fact that all these grifter politicians are all of a sudden advocating for bitcoin should be a red flag to any rational mind.

Cruz has been pro crypto for a while...And the entire state of Texas has been pro-"all money" for a while also
1
There's not really much forcing to shutdown, besides market forces...When that big winter storm hit a few years back, people were hit with massive electric bills, thousands of dollars, because they got caught on their heals. They signed up for market price billing schedule, which most of the time is super low rates. But when the storm struck, and many plants failed, the market price of electricity went ballistic...Should that happen again, it is VERY unlikely that a miner wants to pay the market rate and will throttle back the mining until the affordable rates return...However, I think this all becomes pointless as the reward phase is replaced by the fee phase with the continued halving of the reward. In short, people won't transact a coin that can only provide 7 trxs/s and that won't generate enough trxs fees to support any real power consumption. I don't think this shift happens for another 12 to 16 years, so there could be at least a decade of use before their mining equipment begins to resemble bricks.

Idk what that even means - pro all money.  Cruz is a grifting  piece of shit so it doesn't really change the point
1
from the article:..>"Cruz explained that Bitcoin mining, which consumes a lot of electricity, could be quickly turned off in emergencies. This would allow the energy usually used for mining to be redirected to critical areas, like heating homes or powering hospitals."..The use of the phrase "could be quickly turned off" appears to be refering to government intervention. I would much prefer for this process to happen as you described, but career politicians are constantly trying to justify their paychecks. They would prefer to take credit themselves for saving people from freezing rather than allow market forces to work things out organically.

> Let me break this you all. There is no advantage for any business to accept any forms of crypto ( yes including monero or btc or BCH) . Zilch,nada. Except stable coin. Stable coin like USDC is worth always 1USD , crypto changes in value. Let me give you an example. You own an ice cream shop. Let’s say on a weekend you make $2000 in sales. Following Friday you have to settle your accounts , you know pay for your supplies ( milk sugar energy etc) and your employees. If you kept your $2k in BCH since Sunday it might be now worth $2.5k all good to you. But what about if now your initial $2k is worth $1.5 k ? Your whole business just lost money because of negative margin and income. Also you have to calculate capital gains or loses on all the purchases.( not if you live in tax free countries) You could immediately sell BCH for fiat when your customer buys an ice cream so you are not affected by the BCH price fluctuations, but than again why bother with all this when your customer can pay you with cash credit card or debit. Many businesses tried accepting BCH ( myself included) but it is just not worth it . That is the catch 22 so to speak. We all want it to work , but simple economics prevent this to happen. One more thing , as a customer why would you spend BCH on ice cream when in a month the same BCH could double in value? Everyone heard stories about 10k btc pizzas. BCH is not immune to this ( or any other crypto) ..You are just focusing on volatility, which yes is a problem. ..In some countries, bitcoin would be better to hold than their local currency. ..For a business in the USA, it would be cheaper to accept bitcoin and then immediately exchange it for USD than to accept a credit card payment...Credit card is 3% + 25c per transaction...Accepting bitcoin = free. ..Exchanging bitcoin instantly to USD = 1%..A million dollar business would save 2% a year = $20k doing this...Even on a small scale.  $200 credit card purchase = $6.25 in fees.  Merchant would save $4.25 by accepting bitcoin and instantly converting it to USD...I don't think bitcoin has any current use as a spending vessel due to taxes.  But just showing you that your thinking is pretty single minded.  I don't think people realize just how expensive credit cards are to the merchant.
2
You're right, but to my mind the principal problem isn't that merchants would need to wait for confirmation (they wouldn't really, and since Monero's block time is low the confirmations would be faster) but that in Monero, you _cannot spend the money again until it has a confirmation_, and that even applies to tying up the sender's wallet for a certain number of confirmations, which is a major pain in the ass IMO compared to how Bitcoin (Cash) works...I like Monero's strong privacy, but it does come with a lot of tradeoffs which mean that Bitcoin Cash is at least a strong complementary player in the "electronic cash" field - stronger IMO when it comes to scaling potential and easy-to-access utility.
7
Monero is 0-conf just like BCH. ..But because Monero thanks to Dandelion++ obfuscates the IP of the sender it takes around 5 to 10 seconds to show up in the other wallet if they use a wallet that allows 0-conf. Most of the time the problem lies with some payment service provider not accepting 0-confs...The real problem is chaining transactions, because for privacy reasons this is a horrible feature. It will get fixed with the FCMP upgrade.
5
> Waiting many minutes for confirmation is not acceptable in a brick-and-mortar setting...Brick and mortars wait 2-3 business days for money to deposit (minus 3% too), and then 30 days for the risk of the person attempting to reverse the charge.  And even past 30 days the risk is there.

>That is why in the real world crypto doesn’t work as a payment for ordinary things...Wrong...* Indeed, one can more or less successfully argue that the book-entry-only coins (that is what a serious characterization of your "crypto" should look like, because these coins exist only in the book-entry form) do not work as a payment for ordinary things yet..* Indeed, one can argue that some (but certainly not all) of the book-entry-only coins could double in value in a month..* The coincidence of the above two facts does not mean there is any causal relation between them..* Actually, there is one easy counterargument: if the above was the real cause why the book-entry-only coins cannot work as payment for ordinary things, why the "stablecoins" guaranteed to not have the "doubling in a month" property arguably don't work as payment for ordinary things either?
2
>  I don't mind the fees, because some customers wouldn't make the purchases if they had to pay with cash...Well it could get to the point where the same would be said about bitcoin...I personally do mind the fees because it fucks with purchases.  Businesses charge 3% more to offset so most of life is literally 3% more expensive.  Then the customer has to game the credit card system to get a percentage of that back in points.  It's ridiculous...A restaurant meal bill for $200 cost $6.25 (and 2-3 days finalize) to transact for the restaurant.  That is insane...I also own a business but charge my customers 3% to use a credit card...> I don't want to get into the war between BCH vs BTC but both of them suffer from the same basic notion. Their value increases and decreases. Why would anyone use it as a form of payment where the prices are listed in fiat? I see both as a store of value and nothing else. Just like you mentioned in other countries where their currency is inflated they buy it just to hold it. They did this as well before crypto , exchanging fiat into USD, Deutsch Mark, Canadian Dollar or Yen...Buying/holding bitcoin and eventually selling into fiat to make purchases is the same as buying/holding and using the blockchain itself to make purchases...It's just one less step to make the purchase using bitcoin...I'm not sure why you don't understand why someone wouldn't want to skip a step...My point still stand about taxes which is why people don't spend bitcoin today in the US...Also just to be clear, a business doesn't have to hold bitcoin to accept it.  The payment processor can instantly convert it to USD if the business wants.

Not sure if you are jocking or not, lots of people do it all the time....You make more money holding btc and repaying the loan with your everyday job. It works out better than DCA if done during a bear market. ..Of course this assumes BTC and not BCH as that would not work.

No, because most coins did a nice pump n dump..BCH started at 407$ per coin, now at 355$..For a clearer picture, it started at 0.17 BTC per BCH, now at 0.0058. You lost 96,59% of your purchasing power compared to bitcoin, oh sorry, BTC*

> You lost 96,59% of your purchasing power compared to bitcoin..Bitcoin (oh sorry, BTC) lost a helluva lot of purchasing power by the simple fact that you can't use it anymore to purchase a lot of things that you could before...Maybe 96,59% of things, or maybe 96,59% of people in the world won't be able to use it to purchase anything at all.

> Hopefully we get a BCH one soon..What do you expect from getting an ETF?
4
Deeper liquidity and options, this will allow merchants to hedge transactions and allow greater adoption as a currency for payments, regardless of what the merchant wants to swap it to.
3
Personally, I get to throw a few more portfolio dollars at BCH...Meanwhile.....* broader name recognition (retail investors).* greater access to 401K/retirement pool of funds.* more trxs -> more fees -> greater longevity.* lower fees -> greater liquidity -> reduced rush-out risk -> more trxs.* Wall St acceptance (implied).* SEC acceptance (implied, begrudgingly).* trigger the far greater upside potential than BTC or ETH

so begging for central banksters handouts, because that worked so well for BTC and ETH...
1
ETFs for crypto are being made for Asian markets. Barring any foreign interference, they should start showing up in every part of the world shortly. How does this particular Grayscale product help non-Americans? It doesn't in any direct way, but it acts a clear signal to people everywhere that these crypto ETFs are possible technically, legally, and are meeting an existing market demand. Others will follow suit.
3
market makers and hedge funds can easily arbitrage to anywhere.
1
To make the system more liquid it does help and adds to existing markets...It doesnt change anything to a huge degree, it just will be a net benefit though, especially for companies/people transacting in crypto for large amounts. Access to options will even enable arbitragers to bring this deep liquidity to other places in the world. So yes it can even help a random place in africa hedge, although the merchant would not know it.
1
That's one way to look at it, albeit pessimistic. I rather think of it as one more way for me to vote for BCH with my already encumbered fiat.
1
USA has the most money, and will add the most liquidity, grayscale getting a BCH ETF, will allow others in the USA to do the same, its not about the brand.
2
That wasn’t what I asked. I asked how the underbanked majority of the population is gonna access them.
2
Yes, through third party services that control the keys of the coins...Satoshi would roll in his grave if he would see what people this days are vouching for.
1
And you understand that ETFs are used by the statists to neuter an asset because they can’t have people put money into things they don’t control…
2
My comment could be applied to most or all of the ETFs available currently. It's not exclusive to any one of them.
2
They will not have access to US ETF options, but they will benefit from the effects of these options since that will be arbitraged to many markets including adding liquidity to spot markets worldwide...I guess for those undeveloped places they can use services like BCHBull for hedging/options...Stock market options are a whole other level since hedge funds/institutions have extremely deep pockets, so when they provide liquidity to options markets the sheer numbers are astounding.
1
Its a free country.
1
Of course, but I already have some of that kind of money and at least I would be able to vector some of it toward BCH.
1
The USA will add the most liquidity which could enable merchants to hedge, and this liquidity could easily be arbitraged worldwide. ..Additional market depth, liquidity and options markets would allow more merchants to accept BCH if they want to hedge BCH for some other currency.
1
They have deep fiat pockets, yes. And they like to go fractional on their assets they control.

Title: Indexer Performance Compared: BCHD vs BCHC
27
Hey guys!..As per our latest [Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.paybutton.org/), we've completed the initial development of BCHC - the indexer built to replace BCHD and eventually act as the indexer for Electron Cash...For now, we just wanted to publish some benchmarks we've done to demonstrate the difference in performance over BCHD...The system used was an AMD EPYC 7702 machine with 10 dedicated cores and 64GB of DDR4 ECC RAM as well as an NVME SSD...For those curious, sync times were also measured. [BCHD required 97 hours to complete IBD and BCHC required 43 hours](https://i.imgur.com/9uekanr.png)...We're still working on the PayButton integration but we expect that to be done by the end of this week. After that's done, we'll publish the source under the PayButton GitHub project...If you've got any questions, feel free to ask.
13
Very nice stuff!!
3
Nice. I assume the X-axis is time and shorter is better?
2
Thanks for the informative graphs...Can you explain a little about the "0 UTXOs" benchmark case?
2
Great update, super cool to see...I had criticism of the initial Flipstarter, but great to see you guys reevaluate in light of that and successfully fund & complete a second round. Definitely a confidence inspiring move...Your Flipstarter says you're skipping script validation.  Is BCHD also doing that, so this is an apples to apples comparison?
10
Yes. It's time in seconds.
3
This is how long it takes to return 0 on an address that has 0 UTXOs but 176 total txs.
3
BCHD does script validation because it's all in one node (BCHD)...In contrast, phase 1 of BCHC has it operating with a BCHN "bridge node" which does the script validation instead. The benefit of this is that BCHC should (in theory) never need maintenance from this point onward as long as the BCHN node it's paired to is updated...Phase 2, which we cut for the moment, has it all done in one piece of software. This would better match BCHD but we don't think the latency impact of running the dual node setup will matter much. There have likely been benchmarks done on how long it takes a typical Bitcoin node to process a tx and pass it along to its peers, so it would be this extra latency which we're not showing in the above charts.
4
I see, thanks!
1
Right so if it's not an apples to apples comparison, ie. BCHD is doing script validation and BCHC is not, shouldn't you note that on your graphic??..Seems like pretty important information.  And if possible to do a comparison where you indicated the time BCHD spent on that script validation so it could be shaded a different colour and perhaps only the actual apples-to-apples part of the computation be clear to the reader. That's the extra processing time you mention, I guess you could dig up that info and add it to the chart if you wanted to be more complete, which I'd recommend (although I acknowledge I'm not going hunting for it myself, so it's just a recommendation)...Having no script validation may be beneficial in some ways, but that's not a reason that graphic comparisons should be misleading when it seems like a very easy thing to make a point of difference about.
6
This particular benchmark is about retrieving indexed UTXOs for a given address, so it doesn't involve script validation (which is done when the node is deciding whether or not to accept a transaction in the first place).
9
Ok great, thanks for clarifying.

That is their cold wallet. So either customers purchased them, and then withdrew them into their own cold storage, or there is large BCH interest on other exchanges and coinbase is no longer as popular eg. robinhood seems to be a big crypto exchange player nowadays.

31
You can use bitgree.com

Haveno also has a XMRBCH pair.

In my experience, about the best you can do is obfuscate. For example, you could use a KYC exchange to buy USDC. Then send it to a non-KYC exchange, say coinex, and swap your USDC for USDT. Then transfer the USDT to another anonymous exchange, say Tradeogre, and swap the USDT for BCH...While not impossible to trace, someone would have to spend a significant amount of time and work to track that. So as long as you're not doing anything illegal, you probably have nothing to worry about.
10
There's a few who say they dont use KYC <€1000 (EU loophole in the law) for example Mercuryo(exchange.mercuryo.io). But I couldn't manage to pay with card, my bank blocked it.... Or you buy Monero anywhere (KYC or not) and swap that. Because Monero is untraceable that undoes any KYC you did initially

Can you buy with Fiat with those? Swapping one for the other is not the problem; I want to buy with fiat in a decentralized non-KYC way. So far I've seen Bisq and Haveno; the problem with Bisq is Bitcoin is expensive to trade and the problem with Haveno is poor liquidity.

This is called money laundering, and it’s likely illegal where you live for anyone to provide this service...Another option is to buy a profitable asic. Find an up and coming coin like Kaspa. The ks0 ultra is still profitable and it’s only $400 and nearly silent.  Then send your Kaspa to an anonymous exchange like Coinex and swap it for Bch.

At Zapit we don't have access to banking data that's shared. The payment details and the chat is encrypted using the buyer/seller keys which means only the traders can decrypt it.

Which is why it's likely not to exist, or if it does, not for very long...You can downvote all you want. Just think about what you're actually trying to do first.

Yes we will consider that. But users can also use a VPN to avoid IP tracking. Also a lot of ISPs use dynamic IPs so it's constantly changing anyway.
1
But the ISP has KYC data on you. And there are a ton of meta data that normal people are leaving when surfing the web...So you considering a .onion address makes you so much more attractive. It's really a question of valuing ones customers human rights.

The energy industry will always grow to fill any demand. If not Bitcoin mining then aluminum manufacturing, etc. The supply of electricity has never been a *cost driver*. If there's any process that requires electricity, it will be built and supplied. If consumers want more aluminum, and are willing to pay for it, they will build another plant next to dam...The only cost driver is the distance from any available source. Because Bitcoin mining is mobile, packed into a Conex containers, and placed on site, this makes it ideal to any electricity supplier that has slack production. It's cheaper than building storage batteries, et. al.  And sure, this will include coal. How many windmills are there with a Conex box parked behind it and a Starlink antenna on top?..Bitcoin mining is effectively another form of energy transformer. Miners transform electricity into (sadly) very small data packets. If BTC blocks were bigger, at least you'd get more meaningful data for the energy input. **So if there's any excessive carbon footprint from mining, then I squarely blame small-blockers.**..However, all of this is moot; the reward halving solves this problem. This is all just an acute honeymoon phase of Bitcoin, the Reward Era. Eventually the mining for rewards is replaced by mining for fees, the Fee Era. This requires miners to provide utility for their participation. Operating on a purely trxs-for-fees basis will force consumers to make a buy decision when choosing which coin to transact with. If the coin isn't providing the utility, or moreso another coin is providing the same utility for less, then nature takes course and the coin dies of inefficiency...There are a lot of coins, each with a different balance of ideals. The ideal coin is instantly quick, secure, private, no fees, (and no bad guys get to use it) and only runs on unicorn farts. **The consumer will someday start looking for the coins that satisfy those requirements, and I can guarantee it isn't a coin that consumes massive amounts of electricity for only 7 trx/s.**..Let's give it a few more months or a year for that last halving to sink in. Even in the audio clip, their contract rate for power was 5 years, so we may not see the real effects of the halvening for a while.

Mining BTC is a crime against humanity. I wish activists would disrupt these malicious operations.

... because there was always credit. ..The energy industry always grew to fill any demand, because there was always energy backed fiat to finance the change. ..But... the US has lithium reserves that couldn't be mined. GM made an electric car in the 90s, but they all had to be crushed for some reason. ..US propaganda is crying that China is "over producing" solar and batteries and "crashing prices". The US felt the need to put 50% tariffs to protect domestic energy production. Why can't the US energy sector adapt?..There appears to be something wrong with the US energy insdustry where credit and policy isn't available to freely finance all types of energy or activities.
2
There's going to be an over abundance of clean energy in the future. For all those things and bitcoin too.
2
There's always credit because there's usually a public monopoly on resources. No one ever walks along the river and says, "This is a great spot! I think I will build a dam here and I will make electricity and make money." All major water ways are public and they want a piece of the action, and they want it so bad they will fund cap-costs. What's wrong is the folks in charge don't know what they're negotiating for. For example, in the article, the mayor(?) for the town who made the agreement for the Bitcoin mining, they get a cut of the electricity cost and he admitted he doesn't fully understand Bitcoin. I wonder if he knows about the rewards vs fees and the halving? I wonder if the contract has guaranteed minimums?..China over producing solar... have you seen the quality of solar panels that come from China?  Made for direct to landfill. Often making nowhere near the claimed wattage. I've been looking at US panels, and really they aren't much better...GM's EV1 was killed because it threatened ICE vehicles. Sadly. But now I own two Bolts. I don't consider myself *green* in any fashion, I just like the flat torque curve and cents-per-mile operating cost. Although if you include my tire budget, I probably break even...I agree, the US policy is broken. It's a billion dollar game which makes it subjected to astronomical levels of greed and power politics.

Title: What if btc does actually become sov
1
I think the BSV camp said it best when they said “there is a possibility that we can be right about everything and still lose”. I think the same applies here. Tether can be a scam but never ends up being discovered or shut down. BTC can basically be the opposite of what Bitcoin was built and intended for and still be what everyone says is Bitcoin. You can always be right and still lose.
7
SoV doesn't do NgU, so BSCorons won't be happy about that.
6
In our **very real reality**, tether collapsed in October 2018 after a series of major thefts. ..The collapse was exposed by the New York Attorney General in a lengthy prosecution, that involved making private chats and financials public court record. ..Tether is a real token that exists on transparent public blockchains. So people [can and have](https://protos.com/tether-papers-crypto-stablecoin-usdt-investigation-analysis/) done analysis on who has been receiving the tokens. And we know which part(y/ies) still exist and which parties have gone bankrupt...The [NYAGs settlement] (https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/23/ny-ags-850m-probe-of-bitfinex-tether-ends-in-an-185m-settlement/) stipulated regular audits and that the backing had to be in dollar equivalents, (i.e. T-bills). So if Tether still isn't backed, it would mean the NYAG didn't enforce the terms of the settlement, which is false. ..So tether was exposed. It collapsed. It got bailed out and forced to comply with regular audits and be fully backed as part of a separate settlement. ..Tether will continue to exist as long as the people using it (market markers) find it to be useful. ..Tether is useful to fix the price of BTC and project a winning side in a marketplace of ideas.

I root for every single network to do their part, people in this space so easily forget that we, the average people, have a common adversary.
3
It will always be a house of cards. BTC has no network effect which means no reason for people to hold it once the price goes down. If the faith is broken it will go down faster than it went up...Gold is backed by its use case. The dollar is backed by a massive military and the forced use of it fro oil. Bitcoin was meant to be backed by its use as MoE. BTC is backed by the blind faith of its followers, for now.

>eventually
4
It wont...It doesn't fulfill the requirements on a store of value: it's tooo easy to transfer, its price is tooo volatile, it cannot be used without electricity...@ your edit: obviously btc will not do a 10x ever again. These times are long gone.
2
>What if btc does actually become sov..Your analysis is shallow. You should realize that BTC is a coin, because..* Bitcoin designer Satoshi Nakamoto designed it to be a coin, giving it properties such as.   * recognizability.   * portability.   * durability.* Bitcoin designer also designed bitcoin to be *scarce*...Every numismatist can tell you that a coin having the above properties can be collected and used as a store of value. Thus, BTC already *is* a store of value...Is that important, though? Actually, not. What many consider more important is the NgU property, which is not the same as a simple SoV.
2
I mean, that IS the reality. And Tether isn’t the binary risk that it once was, specifically when it comes to BTC. It’s integrated into much bigger inflows now from the Tradfi market in regards to the ETF’s- so that liquidity isn’t just going to fall away overnight. ..And true p2p adoption is still years away imo, the onboarding experience also needs to be integrated better into the legacy payments space if you want global onboarding. And Ethereum (and the entire L2 ecosystem) has probably captured everything in between- DeFI and smart contracts.

On a long enough time scale every fraud collapses. Every unbacked FIAT has gone to shits in history.

Using AI assistance to figure out app development on BCH...Bitcoin/LN has too much technical overhead and the transaction fees make it unusable...Examples:..# BCH Donation Platform..Create a platform where users can donate BCH to charitable organizations or causes. This could include:..* **Transparency Features**: Use blockchain technology to track donations, ensuring transparency and trust..* **Charity Network**: Partner with a network of verified charities that accept BCH, expanding the range of causes users can support..* **Recurring Donations**: Enable users to set up recurring donations in BCH, simplifying the process of regular giving...# BCH Tipping & Micro-Payments App..Develop a social media or messaging app that integrates BCH tipping functionality. Users can tip content creators or friends directly with BCH for their contributions or interactions...* **Automatic Tipping**: Allow users to set up automatic tipping for content they enjoy (e.g., a set amount of BCH per like or share)..* **Micro-Payments for Articles**: Enable users to pay small amounts of BCH to unlock premium content, fostering a pay-per-article model for online journalism.

I got hyped about bitcoin when I saw it being used in africa. Then I started accumulating, and trying to use it myself, and understood bch was the real use coin. And Bitcoin is the real shield that protects it from the nobrainers, while everyone attacks bitcoin, bch can help real people in use.

I see many bitcoin L2s are developing and progressing. I’ve also learned about Satz, which allows L2s to anchor on the Bitcoin main chain, borrowing its security and other features.

There is always development going on, and this is at another level, aiming to either scale or enhance security and decentralization. I'd suggest you explore Satz. It's an execution protocol aimed at complementing L2 and also bringing smart contracts.

>I’ve used it since over a year now, fees are moderate, I can’t complain using the most secure chain to store my data for 1$..what make you think it is the most secure chain?
1
Because in a nutshell it's using PoW and has the highest hashrate
1
>Because in a nutshell it’s using PoW and has the highest hashrate..Interresting and how do you know is more than 51% of the hash is not owned by a single entity?..If a single entity own more than 51% the chain is not trustless and secure anymore....almost like raw hash rate power is meangingless...Today you learned something.
1
Because you can actually check it, and it's also not that black and white, we had occurrences where entities had more than 51%
1
>Because you can actually check it, ..How?..>and it’s also not that black and white, we had occurrences where entities had more than 51%..We dont know how many times, it is trivial to hide were hash rate come from… ...and keep in mind when on entity pass 51% the whole chain because trusted...It is not black and white, 51% is a critical thresold...Looking at raw hash rate to evaluate the security of a blockchain is very naive.
1
The fact you don't know where to check this kind of data tells me quiet enough tbh. .Ghash had about 51% in 2014, but didn't even try to manipulate and also backed down after realizing the implications of their control. ..For 1 entity to have 51%, they'd need about 1.8mio S21 miners, so I don't think it's baseless to evaluate the security with the raw hash rate. .If this numbers grows, it's just getting more impossible for anyone to gaining control.
1
>The fact you don’t know where to check this kind of data tells me quiet enough tbh. Ghash had about 51% in 2014, but didn’t even try to manipulate and also backed down after realizing the implications of their control...It is trivial to split hash power under many pool to hide centralisation...Public pool share data tell you **literaly nothing** about the real network decentralisation...>For 1 entity to have 51%, they’d need about 1.8mio S21 miners, so I don’t think it’s baseless to evaluate the security with the raw hash rate. If this numbers grows, it’s just getting more impossible for anyone to gaining control...Not at all, few large miners can cooperate to reverse the chain all they want even at lower centralisation than 51%...It is impossible know the health/decentralisation/strenth of a POW blockchain crypto (POS is even worst)
1
You're not an expert on this field, but still you somehow think you are? I'm just guessing, but most of your sayings is very vague and rather misleading. .The sheer size of the network is making the 51% attacks quiet impossible, not even talking about maintaining the hashrate at these levels, which is just absurd to even think about. .The pools have interest in not destroying the whole network too you know, they're not a threat.
1
>You’re not an expert on this field, but still you somehow think you are? I’m just guessing, but most of your sayings is very vague and rather misleading. ..I am certainly not an expert but understanding POW security incentive amd decentralisation is not that hard....>The sheer size of the network is making the 51% attacks quiet impossible, ..Size has nothing to do with it and BTC always had massive mining farm problem, centralisation of hash power has always been an issue....>not even talking about maintaining the hashrate at these levels, which is just absurd to even think about. The pools have interest in not destroying the whole network too you know, they’re not a threat...Pool own no hash power themselves and again it is trivial to hide a position of mining dominance. ..Hash are perfectly fungible after all.
1
Size has nothing to do with it? 😂 where have you been my friend, it's the number 1 reason why there won't be another pow that's as powerful and decentralized as bitcoin. Any state could have interrupted the network back then, because it was still affordable to potentially harm the network, now it's not anymore, that's why size matters. .Of course the pool doesn't own it, they manage it.
1
>Size has nothing to do with it? 😂 where have you been my friend, it’s the number 1 reason why there won’t be another pow that’s as powerful and decentralized as bitcoin. ..Size dont imply decentralistion...The two are two very diferent concept and with a smaller PoW coin can be more secure that bitcoin if it is more decentralised...Yes, I guess you are bit new to crypto...>Any state could have interrupted the network back then, because it was still affordable to potentially harm the network, now it’s not anymore, that’s why size matters.

1
I didn't say it implies decentralization, did I?..To be called a secure network, in this case with bitcoin, it has to stand against potential attackers and single entities trying to acquire more than half of the hashrate, what has the decentralization got to do with it? .."A smaller pow coin can be more secure than bitcoin if it is more decentralized" - no, it can't. If so, let me know, please
1
>I didn’t say it implies decentralization, did I?..you did..you said 51% is too much hash rate for one single entity...>To be called a secure network, in this case with bitcoin, it has to stand against potential attackers and single entities trying to acquire more than half of the hashrate, what has the decentralization got to do with it?..Decentralisation mean there is no single entity that own more than 50% of hash rate...>“A smaller pow coin can be more secure than bitcoin if it is more decentralized” - no, it can’t.

Decentralization means that control and decision-making are distributed across a network of users rather than being managed by a single central authority, that's basic knowledge.  ..Soo you can't tell me why a smaller pow network could be more secure than bitcoin?

>Decentralization means that control and decision-making are distributed across a network of users rather than being managed by a single central authority, that’s basic knowledge...it is the same thing..and if one entity reach 51% they can reverse any blocks they want, any 51% attack they want, enforce any soft fork they want...That mean the network is centralised...>Soo you can’t tell me why a smaller pow network could be more secure than bitcoin? ..yes if it is more decentralised among other things...>I did a quick search up, but the answer I got didn’t match with yours🤔..look, educate yourself a bit.

1
>No😂 they couldn’t magically reverse ANY blocks lol, this only applies to most recent blocks, ..They can, if you have 51% you will always produce a longer chain than the whole network ever can. so yes someone with consistant 51% hash power can reserve as many blocks as want...Actually some have calculated that you can achieve that with a much smaller thresold because the attacker will be stealing block reward for every block it reverse (+ some shadow mining tactics).. bankrupting other miners...>bro you’re now blatantly oversimplifying and calling me out to do research, get in touch with reality..This is simple, basic blockchain mechanic.

Title: In order for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to survive, it needs to innovate or face irrelevancy
0
The innovation is already built-in. There's no need to tack-on features or tech that no one will use. ..The focus should be and always has been get merchants on board. Help a crypto get accepted at most places, the rest is distracting noise. Don't get distracted by the noise.
28
You were speaking ill of the Bitcoin Cash Podcast the other day. I watched the latest episode yesterday. To me, the picture painted was pretty positive with respect to innovation and applications that are just over the horizon. If you didn't watch it, I would recommend it.
11
With adoption comes innovation...It's adoption that is fundamental...It's what Bitcoin had in 2009-2014...Since then, BTC has been hijacked and the masses made to believe that Bitcoin is just like a stock, mostly, and they're conditioned to think that using it in the manner it was intended, i.e. to exercise economic freedom, which is punished by regulation and laws these days, is not worth the trouble and a futile endeavor...Nearly all the benefits of Bitcoin are lost once its primary goal - peer to peer electronic cash (_currency_) - is abandoned...Let's list some of these benefits, since people are slavishly scared to even imagine a different world anymore!..- money becoming as really ownable again as precious metal coinage was a long time ago.- a return of monetary power to the individual, with a foundational layer where spending decisions are constrained only through public protocol rules and not arbitrary decisions by third parties (intermediaries).- the return of the financial aspect of privacy to the individual (you can own currency where it is at your discretion to disclose how much you own, and your spending habits can be strongly privacy-protected by cryptography).- a shared global currency for humanity that is not owned and controlled by central interests (that's a first!).- a currency whose issuance is governed by public, auditable, mathematical rules and which essentially cannot be inflated without consensus, because the majority could decide to opt out of such inflation if anybody were to attempt it (and Bitcoin transactions being constrained by protocol rules, any such attempts at inflation would be soon apparent).- a currency that would truly enable people to build wealth that cannot simply be confiscated or stolen by evildoers or parasitic societal players

no worries, we have Jihan who's very invested to protect the network

Speaking from a merchant which accepts BCH, .It seems most people aren’t too familiar to BCH yet..It would be nice to have a sticker or something for all the merchants, written “why pay with BCH?” with a QR code which links to multilingual site explaining about BCH. I hope the community can make this happen?!
12
>There's no need to tack-on features or tech that no one will use...If I look at the comparatively low amount of txs the network does, maybe it needs features that someone *will* use. The community is very good at pointing out what BCH *could* do...>The focus should be and always has been get merchants on board...If that has always been the focus, it did not result in a significant growth of transactions, the main metric of a successful currency...[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-ltc-bch.html#3y](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-ltc-bch.html#3y)..For years & years BCH had nothing but "potential". Where are the results?
1
We’ll merchants and users struggle to use BCH with 10 minute block times and none of the preconsensus was ever implemented. Zero conf doesn’t work in practice despite all the years of handwringing. So how is BCH is gonna gain adoption while committed to a shitty user experience and not innovating?

Wow!  Saved

None of that Hopium brings BCH to the next level. The fact is it’s been 7 years and BCH is still struggling to survive. The dwindling block rewards and security issues are going to be paramount including some of those other items listed in the post, because as it stands now BCH is drowning in a sea of other coins that are doing much better simply by making changes instead of putting ear muffs on and saying “La La La 🎶.”
-4
and the cheating woke Dems stole the election, as Trump would say.
-6
If by 'features that someone will use' you mean stuff like NFTs, then no thank you...I don't think BCH itself needs more features, but the associated utilities certainly do. The wallets need to be easier to use and friendlier to non-techies. But more importantly we need for things like CURRENT EXISTING major point of sale tools to be able to use it. Major chain stores should be easily able to just plug in a module to their current system and a "Pay with BCH" option should appear on the keypad the customers use...When I go to Walmart or one of my favorite grocery stores and use the self-checkout the payment screen shows nice logos of credit cards and EBT. Imagine seeing the BCH logo next to that, and when you click on it a QR code pops up...But it CANNOT be a separate app or device that the store has to manage. It needs to be integrated into their existing system, including the accounting software.
7
>For years & years BCH had nothing but .....It is well known that your "years & years" actually is about 8.5 years by which bitcoin's history has been set back. We can thank for those years the inventors of such "innovations" as..* RBF - a destruction of bitcoin's zero confirmation functionality.* Segwit - a destruction of bitcoin's flexibility, negatively influencing its future portability.* lightning network - a network that depends on intermediaries.* stablecoins - not a true innovation; everybody waiting long enough shall find out what their "stable" means.* NFTs - bitcoin's support for them is a kind of economical suicide:.   * they decrease efficiency of bitcoin.   * they are an attempt to support economical competition of bitcoin.* SLP tokens - yet another kind of economical suicide.* [memo.cash](http://memo.cash) - an attempt to decrease efficiency.* developer's tax - actually a proof that (a split of) bitcoin can become a security..So, beware of rash "innovations". They mean danger to bitcoin!

Zero conf does work. Some don’t know to enable it..But we are working on it. https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/tailstorm-a-secure-and-fair-blockchain-for-cash-transactions/1357/50

Zero conf works fine for me and the Bitcoin Cash experience is great. Maybe you're just doing it wrong. Maybe just try and BCH harder bro.

> Zero conf doesn’t work in practice..How so? Seems to work fine for me.

Stagnation means falling behind.

Once you have ..1. A truly scaleable base layer (remains to be seen for BCH, though I am optimistic as a Pi5 could probably handle 1GB blocks using only half the bandwidth of a 4k Netflix Show ~13Mb/s or ~1.5% of a Gigabit fibre connection)..2. A sufficiently rich **base layer** scripting language (Cashtokens) ..**1 & 2** together are  what actually put the **permissionless** into  *[Permissionless P2P Money For The Whole World.](https://odysee.com/Permissionless-P2P-Money-For-The-Whole-World:2)*...Anybody (with the skills) can build almost anything on top **without having to ask permission from base layer consensus devs and or get the community behind them**...* Here's what can be done with [composability](https://youtu.be/xP5-iIeKXE8) using just [4 rules](https://archive.is/CkL9i#selection-1937.0-1955.91) - truly miraculous!...I am curious as to what changes to BCH you think **could** make a difference, beyond what is already planned?
12
These "setbacks" are being used & increased the number of transactions...BCH should argue from a position of strength it currently does not have when criticizing these things. It really needs stronger on chain metrics to give these arguments credibility imo.
2
There have been so many preconsensus discussions and nothing happening. I consider preconsensus a wishful fantasy. Faster block times (like 1 minute) are possible today with known characteristics and no game theory surprises. And you can still do whatever flavor of preconsensus you arrive at in a couple decades.
-2
Yeah if it works so fine, why we talking for years about preconsensus then?
2
>It really needs stronger on chain metrics to give these arguments credibility imo...Aha, so the setbacks these "innovations" caused turned the history of bitcoin 8.5 years back and you are trying to argument that 7 years after these things happened, BCH does not have the strength you consider adequate? Try to use more adequate arguments.
2
>These "setbacks" are being used & increased the number of transactions...As BSV successfully demonstrated, the number of transactions is irrelevant, if the transactions do not increase the liquidity of the coin.
1
TailStorm is not preconsensus. Highly recommend reading the whitepaper and this thread.

It does work fine. Double-spending is the concern of the recipient, not the spender. So, the recipient is the one who manages the risks, relative to everything else they are involved in or with. For me, it's more a perception problem than a real one, except for exchanges, which are entities with targets painted on them. Maybe a faster block time helps there. Maybe it doesn't. Now you might argue that perception is reality, which is fine, but also ask yourself if BCH did wave a magic wand and have 2-3 second confirmations tomorrow, do you really think that would win the meme war? Or are we better off worrying about grass roots adoption and leaving the side show to the BTC cult?
3
All I say that in a free market best products win out. It is time that BCH gains transactions to demonstrate that. It would add additional credibility.
2
That is a point I will take. The most liquid asset is best for exchanges of goods & services.
2
Anything that attempts to make any guarantee over zero conf before there is a block mined is by definition preconsensus.

Title: Let’s differentiate BCH sats from BTC sats
0
it is simple - you can move 1000 Sats on BitcoinCash BCH, Chain while you can´t do so on BTC blockchain due to Congestion, high Fees and as a least "feature" RBF..Satoshi must be rotating at his grave in high speed
11
BTC sats are un-spendable since the fees are higher than their value.
12
Just flipp'em. Problem solved.
5
For BTC they could be called Feetoshi's... because that's all you will be able to spend that small of an amount on.
10
How about 100M BSs equals one BlockstreamCoin?
2
BTC sats will become irrelevant sooner rather than later.
2
RBF is a tax on the poor to move their money...The evil central banking cabal is going to rot in the hell they thought was imaginary.
4
Lightning network anyone?
1
>For BTC they could be called Feetoshi’s... because that’s all you will be able to spend that small of an amount on...Unspendeable-toshi..
6
Ok, but still why not differentiate in the meantime?
-1
> Lightning network..Lightning is not a "scaling" solution. It's best conceptualized as a form of semi-custodial *banking*.  It is a necessarily-imperfect substitute for actual on-chain payments and one with strong inherent incentives towards massive centralization. Moreover, it becomes a progressively *more* imperfect substitute and its incentives towards centralization become progressively *stronger* as on-chain fees rise and the amount of "leverage" in the system increases (i.e., as the Lightning Network becomes larger relative to the tiny base blockchain atop which it operates).  ..Expanded thoughts [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1by2vqi/did_you_know_that_the_bitcoin_lightning_network/kykkrxv/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bzjz5i/layers/).

Some of the most expensive dust anyone could ever own.

I think that a natural differentiation will come about when Bitcoin Cash introduces fractional satoshis as _even smaller_ units of its currency than BTC has...At that point a new term may be needed for the smallest unit (which might be a 1000th of a satoshi or less)...Or maybe no new term is needed at all. On BTC, protocols like Lightning internally use sub-satoshi values and they just refer to them as 'millisats' or similar, ie. still referencing the satoshi as base unit...Until then, everyone understands what a satoshi is - both on BTC and on BCH. There is really no definitional difference, and it's unclear why there ought to ever be one.

Title: The market crash has made Bitcoin mining unprofitable. Which devices are still profitable?
4
What do you expect? It be profitable 100% of the time?All assets go up and down in profitability.
3
Price of electricity and price of machine have a lot to do with profitability too. [https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator)
2
with free power every miner is profitable, with expensive power no miner is. So basically it depends on your power costs.
1
if it were so unprofitable then we wouldn't be at an all-time high for hashing rate
1
You basically have to mine in either Texas or China.
1
What do I know about complexity?
0
hashing rate is v.high now thanks to the volatility of the price. HEnce it triggers A LOT of transactions , we have seen BIG volumes recently with the last drop , so BTC is still profitable thansk to the transactions fees. ..Some make more money with the transactions fees than from mining

Bridging would be nice. Do you think you could work out this idea: https://gist.github.com/A60AB5450353F40E/59eee82c5d6e3d989166bb8eaf7826e9..Stakers would lock up their main chain BCH in a little DAO and emit voting shares as [CashTokens](https://www.cashtokens.org)  ...
4
Expanding Bitcoin Cash to the Interchain could open up new opportunities for interoperability and use cases. Excited to see how it might enhance the BCH ecosystem.
2
This is a pre-proposal to gather community sentiment around it first. What do you think about the idea/project?
4
You get it! Hope more and more people support this. Will let it circulate more and if gains traction will create the Flipstarter! Share the idea around! Let’s make it happen.
1
Devil is in the details. Who would maintain it and for how long etc. Would it be nice to have? Sure..Is it worth $30,000? Not to me personally, as I have no use for it, but other people may think so.  .Would it inspire other people and project to use BCH more? I have no idea.

Title: Bitcoin Reserve Bill
9
Pump my bag Bill...Also low karma account
5
> help reduce our nation's unchecked spending..There's a lot of problems with the above concepts, but I'll just provide this advice to US taxpayers:..If you want to reduce government unchecked spending, then you need a bill which mandates checked spending, and if Bitcoin is supposed to be the instrument of bringing about positive change on the accountability front, then government spending needs to be ... in Bitcoin...This would require Bitcoin to be ... a currency ... usable on the daily by American citizens, companies, institutions .....None of this is going to happen with a BTC crippled to 7 tps.
6
The shareholders of the FED should continue with their coup plans so the US Treasury can zero out their T-bills under 14A§4. ..The next failed coup should zero out tens of trillions of US debt...EDIT:..Time in T-bills is greater than timing T-bills:..https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/warren-buffett-now-owns-more-t-bills-than-the-federal-reserve.html

Nobody would agree that the US government should be spending billions on NVDA stock speculation or investing in rare Charizard cards. But when it comes to crypto we just suspend all good sense because so many people are so desperate to get rich quick and quit their day jobs...Bitcoin routinely moves over 10% in a single day. It's not a reserve asset. It moves pretty much with the NASDAQ. It's very risk-on. The member of Congress who proposed this bill should be disqualified from serving in office.

It's starting to be seen by bigger players as more "short term volatile; long term hold not nearly as risky"

>Nobody would agree that the US government should be spending billions..Ever heard of The Federal Reserve? Pretty much everybody in finance agrees they should continue bailing out the house of cards formerly known as the US economy. If your job depending on printing presses going BRRR all night you'd probably be onboard too. Or maybe you job does depend on BRRR-Powell but you don't realize it. Yet.

In the last 2 weeks it has traded in as much as a 30% range. That's more volatile than virtually everything else in the market, except maybe penny stocks...Since when is the US government a speculator to that degree?
0
never heard of her
2
Didn't the US government just print 40% of the current supply of dollars in the last few years? That's a pretty speculative move. Otherwise you're right the government likes to be 'safe' and keep numbers on everything stable and low. But seeing how over long time spans (they like those) the trend is pretty clear on BTC, they might make a move based on how much money they plan to print. They can keep the value of the dollar in BTC before they tank the value of the dollar with their printer.
2
The us owns like $1.2B in cheese, i think BTC could be a better store of value

she's pretty "hot"

In order to buy Bitcoin they would have to print too. The US government is broke...Your justification is akin to: well, you've been going out to fancy restaurants you can't afford so might as well buy a Lamborghini.

I'm sure you could go out and borrow a bunch of money if you wanted to. Apply for a capital one credit card. Go to citi financial and get a 30% loan...It doesn't mean its a good idea to do so and then spend it all on Bitcoin. Which is why you havent done it.
