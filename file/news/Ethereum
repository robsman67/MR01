ATOM is hyper inflationary. why are you even comparing it to ETH.
18
You can read plenty of research on Ethereum economics at [Ethresearch](https://ethresear.ch/), with new posts published daily...The question regarding value accrual was the [top question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/comment/llbzkm1/) in our recent AMA and received answers from Justin, Dankrad and me. Here is a [direct link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/comment/llmg6dv/) to mine.

Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency yet generates less fees than Ethereum and they aren't even burnt. ..The thing that is valuable is being a money and ETH is the money of L2's. This is valuable.
2
No comparison needed

Can't believe Atom has failed. I'm still holding some.

I am comparing the part of value accretion failure, not other parts of the coin economics
-9
Yep I read from this AMA. It’s great that EF starts to pay attention on this issue now. I will say ETH burn is only one of the major issues of value accretion lost - as no one can force L2 to burn ETH. The other issue is that whether ETH can be economically secure and viable if it becomes a settlement layer prematurely without assurance of value accretion. People love to draw Bitcoin as a counter-example of value storage layer only, but I will say fine, what can make Ethereum match up against Bitcoin since Bitcoin has clear name recognition and first-mover advantage, if not value accretion
-2
Fine if you think Ethereum will take over Bitcoin just like Silver will take over Gold. I am more interested in realistic path to beat Bitcoin instead of day dreaming
-7
Yeah ATOM is having a hard time figuring out how cosmo SDK users can contribute to $ATOM value besides lip service. It’s easy to say $ATOM ecosystem is vibrant but extremely hard to say that ecosystem still belongs to $ATOM not just an open source service
0
Researchers developing Ethereum have always understood the importance of facilitating sustainable economic activity, which the scaling roadmap is a testament to. Layer 2s will need to pay for Ethereum's services with ETH, and this ETH will be burned. Becoming a settlement layer is not something that can be done prematurely, it is rather the opposite, a foundation of value accrual.
1
> no one can force L2 to burn ETH..This is incorrect. L2s are generally rollups, which store compressed transactions on the main chain in blobs. They have to burn ETH to do that...They're barely burning any right now, because we have more blob space than they have demand. But as they get bigger, there will start to be contention again and blob space will get more expensive.
1
I meant ETH congestion fee that L2 sequencer collected - L2 did not burn it. Look at Base chain who collects $200m per year but none of this was burnt. If it were in L1, it would have been burnt

problem is that to revoke you'll need eth for gas, since you are transferring eth from an other wallet you can't do it on the same tx...you'll need your own bot that monitor the blockchain and emmit the revoke as soon as the eth are available on your adress, with enough GWEI to take priority on the drainer bot if it notices your eth and try to take them out at the same time...that bot probably has high speed RPCs available and can see stuff before you, so probably won't work...if the drainer bot is smart it might even re-emmit a tx with higher GWEI than yours, your bot will need to monitor that too, and then emmit a counter tx with a even higher GWEI to overtake it. and so on...An epic battle for sure...  .# EDIT : ..wait, approuval is only for ERC-20 contract, ETH is the native coin, the only way to move ETH is with the private key, there is nothing to revoke if it can do that
2
I have an issue like that last month. The wallet that i use to stake token got drain. What i do to stop the drain is to create a drain using Python and set it with a higher gas fee. That will stop the drainer bot because of double nonce when theirs try to make any tx.
2
You best bet is to set a drainer yourself to move it faster that the scammer.
1
You can go to revoke(dot)cash and revoke all approvals.
1
Appreciate the reply regardless. Is there any way to identify which contract would be the one to focus on revoking? Unfortunately I only learnt about revoking after this happened so no real idea which of the current 30 contract approvals I have open is the culprit >.<
2
Very interesting. Any guides on how to do this? Thanks!
1
Fight fire with fire. Guess that's an option. Thanks
2
I think you might actually be able to revoke via etherscan too, but not certain
1
Thanks. Yea I think that was the one that came up a while back when I researched the problem the first time as well. Won't you need gas for this however?
1
on the explorer, put your address and you will see which contract or person is taking you stuff...but approuval is only for ERC-20 contract, ETH is the native coin, the only way to move ETH is with the private key, there is nothing to revoke if it can do that..So I don't think that a contract is stealing your ETHs
1
This will help you with the basic.  https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/134720/execute-a-contract-function-from-web3-py.Just reply to this comment if you have any other questions.
1
This is directly from the revoke dot cash site. Seems like you might have to call it a loss. Hopefully someone chimes in with a trick for you...# I want to revoke approvals, but when I add ETH to my account it gets stolen...If you have a so-called "sweeper bot" on your account that steals any ETH as soon as it comes in, your seed phrase was compromised. This means that revoking approvals is not going to help with your wallet security. Unfortunately, there is no way for your wallet to recover from this. You should abandon this wallet and create a new one.
5
It aligns with what I see on the revoke(dot)cash website where it states if your ETH only is being moved as soon as it lands then someone has your private key. Strange however that if that was the case they have not moved anything else yet, unless they only have the private key for ETH itself and not the actual Ledger seed. Also why is the person then not moving over the tokens I have or started to unbond stakes to move them, like MATIC. Wild west this
1
Will do. Thanks again

The address are usually the same but would make you lose your tokens in terms of a payments if you send one to the other

They're all evm compatible wallets, you just need to make sure you're on the right network when making a transaction...Don't click any links sent to you, it's a scam!

Some DeFi basics so it helps you in future:..Ethereum is a network. It’s a layer 1 network. If USA is a network and USD is its currency, ETH on ethereum is the “native coin”..Ethereum can make tokens. You can make tokens on ethereum using various dApps (decentralized apps)...Ethereum can also make layer 2 (L2) networks. You’ll see the word EVM thrown around (ethereum virtual machine). Basically you can make a network of your own on ethereum. But what about “native coin”? ..Native coin can differ in L2s, base network is L2 and accepts wrapped ethereum. If your wallet is a multi network wallet, getting an actual ethereum on your wallet address instead of base  network’s ethereum results in ETH deposit only on L1. ..However, let’s say you want to convert L1-> L2 or vice versa… use bridge apps. Debridge is a very good well known app. It works outside of EVMs as well. You can convert eth to btc directly on chain...On chain means, you don’t need to do this on a centralized exchange  (cex for short and also referred to as off chain). Centralized exchange usually hinders large transactions and can block your funds forever. If you’re insisting on cex , make sure the deposit network is the correct one. ..Hope this helps
1
I wonder if their key derivation scheme is the same or not
1
I guess I'm lucky that Rainbow is on Base otherwise I would have lost these coins forever. The issue now is that I have Base ETH and want to send it to someone who is on main. Do I have to go through a crypto converter again or is there a cheaper way?
1
Yes swap it to mainnet ETH.
2
If you use an exchange like coinbase you can do it for free. Just change the network to send to am
1
It has nothing to do with Rainbow specifically...Rainbow is a wallet (software) for managing onchain accounts...And your onchain account exists at the same address, derived from the same seed phrase or private key, on all networks/blockchains that use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)...EVM chains include Ethereum mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Scroll, but also Polygon, Gnosis, Binance Chain...Whichever wallet you used to generate your seed phrase, it would create account(s) that effectively exist on all of the mentioned networks at once, though you certainly don't ever have to use them...Hope that clarifies things a bit more.

Think of ethereum as a decentralised global computer, the future of eth is programmable exchange of value. NFTs, games, social media tips etc. contracts can be written up to automatically achieve the intended results ...Think of BTC has digital gold, it’s a scarce asset class that can be used as an exchange of value
50
ETH is everything crypto is trying to achieve, decentralised, programmable money. It's all fundamentals, but the narrative is weak because everyone else attacks ETH to try make their own piece of shit chain look better in contrast...BTC is all narrative, it has a terminal security funding issue that no-one seems to care even thinking about, let alone genuinely trying to resolve...If you think blockchain has any sort of future, it's on Ethereum because Ethereum is the only serious blockchain so far.
14
Ethereum is programable money. Smart money. ..Bitcoin is the hardest money you’ll ever find. ..They compliment each other despite what you may hear on Twitter. ..Ethereum always lags the market rallies. My two cents if you are just interested in price action.
5
I think as a place for AI to access contracts and perform actions.
3
I plan to hold. If I’m going to hold I might as well stake. I can’t stake with BTC.
8
Global, always on, decentralized, compute
7
Decentralized, global access, blockchain technology allowing for all transactions to be placed in a public ledger, doesn’t move based on news, allows for diversification in an unknown economy and is not going anywhere anytime soon. Has multiple use cases which needs more time for business adoption. HODL
3
You should buy an even weighting of 50% ETH and BTC. 
3
Google “Ether is the Best Model for Money the World has Ever Seen: David Hoffman”..It’s an article from 2019 that kind of made it click for me. I still go back to it sometimes...Ethereum 2.0 has enabled staking and EIP-1559 has been implemented at this point.
3
I don't know whether either Bitcoin or Ethereum will succeed economically, but I know Bitcoin will eventually fail in its security...Bitcoin does not have a sustainable long-term security model. Its development has basically stalled and ossified while Ethereum keeps updating and adopting to whatever needs come up...The biggest problem with Bitcoin is that its security will probably fail 50 years from now. I'm confident this will happen unless Bitcoin fixes its security model. Plenty of PoW blockchains have failed due to low security budget...Despite its supply cap, Bitcoin actually has a lot of inflation. The first year, it had over 100% inflation. Inflation was still higher than 10% for the first 4 years. Ethereum's EIP-1559 protocol burns tokens, so it largely counterbalances token issuance. That's why Ethereum still has 10x less inflation than Bitcoin despite that Ether has no supply cap...Every 4 years, its security budget halves. Every 40 years, the security falls 99.9%. Transaction fees currently pay for about 2-5% of Bitcoin's block rewards. The last time transaction fees were higher than the block subsidy, transaction fees were $500/tx...And even with $500 transaction fees, Bitcoin is still a $1T market cap cryptocurrency with only a $20B security budget. Which means you can absolutely 51% attack Bitcoin with only $20B of mining equipment. It might take an attacker years to acquire that much mining rigs, but it will get easier as the block subsidy disappears and more miners drop out and sell their equipment...40 years from now, Bitcoin will likely have a $100M to $1B of security protecting $1-10T worth of Bitcoin. And attacker could easily destroy 10000x more assets than the cost of the attack. The other thing is that Bitcoin has no slashing while in Ethereum, attacker are instantly kicked off the validator set for 36 days and are slashed for nearly ALL of their staked Ether...There's also the issue of selfish mining and game theory after the block subsidy disappears. Look up the Princeton research paper on post-halving mining strategies: "On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward"...Basically says it's pretty easy to manipulate selfish mining and significantly reduce the cost of executing a 51% reorgs, all while still not looking like an outright attack. So an attacker could keep playing that game until they're ready for a full-blown withholding attack.
38
For me, it's about diversification. Traditional finance has it's place, but it's ruled by bankers and they limit the smallfolk in their ability to play the game, for example, through trading restrictions, access, liquidity. ..Decentralized finance, one of the cornerstones of ethereum network, is a novel alternative to the traditional ways. You can get loans, gamble, buy goods and services, and invest with no restrictions (or protections). It's the wild west. If you don't know how to play, best just buy 50/50 eth and btc and who knows...could be worth something.
3
So far, I think ETH functions well with DApps, NFTs, smart contracts, and DeFi; the list keeps growing. Just hold
2
Imagine Apple's App Store used Apple coins to pay for Apps...What do you think would happen to the price of Apple coins, over time, assuming the App Store got more popular?
2
Banks are currently building on Eth to use as backbone of operations
2
Simple as I can..Blockchain is the current Gold Rush...BTC is the gold.ETH is a brand of picks & shovels..The theory is that you make your money in a gold rush, selling picks & shovels...The main problem is that while 50% of shovels are brand ETH, there are another 50% of shovel brands (SOL, ADA, TON, BNB), and they are shiny and new. ..So, in this scenario, it would seem you are only investing in a portion of the "gold rush." Might be good to spread your $$ around a little.
2
Layman terms:...Bitcoin is about long term monetary investment..Ethereum is about long term technology...There are many ‘networks’ that run on top of Ethereum. They have games, chat, dns, etc that can albeit not very usefully (at the moment) on ethereum. You can run tokenized btc in ethereum for example. Bitcoin network can’t really do this. ...Now for the gloom in both:..Bitcoin — long term there is a lot of speculation. Like when the last bitcoin is mined. Then what. Are people going to keep the network to support the whales. Will there be a run on the ‘banks’. Will the network be too big to fail. A lot of speculation when that day comes (though not for another 80 years). It becomes more centralized each day as far as bag holders. ..Ethereum — is it just a stop over for some better blockchain; is it the Novell or AOL of blockchain?  With the emergence of quantum computers and ai, is blockchain the future or tech or will fade away. Or perhaps converge with those other sectors and make something truly magical.
2
They both tend to move together. I view BTC as digital gold and ETH as digital silver.
2
Like an AI action switchboard lol.

I just do both so I don’t have to stress about it

No one knows about future, crypto is even harder to predict. Prepare to lose money before investing in it.

I have been using DeFi on and off for a few years now, mostly on the Ethereum Blockchain...What needs to happen:..The Metamask wallet needs to sort itself out big time!..It's so incompatible with Firefox browser and Brave Browser, forcing me to always use Chrome browser. ..Throw in a Ledger hardware wallets and it way over complicates things, although you really need to protect your Metamask wallet with a hardware wallet, I would never just use Metamask as a soft wallet. ..In fact the whole DeFi platforms, uniswap, 1inch, ect, they all need to sort themselves out and become so simply to use, because at this point you still need a education degree in DeFi to be able to us it!

no one uses btc, everyone uses eth
1
Yes, ETH will remain a relic of early blockchain days and it will have some price becuase people will still use it from time to time to transact...We are in pets.com days of blockchain where greedy founders milk suckers like you for money...Bitcoin is and will remain the only monetary revolution of this century. Just dca and have fun...Just the fact that you’re asking here meqns you dont understand what you’re buying which is a proof in itself.

Vitalik keeps selling. Ethereum Foundation keeps selling. People realize they're being slow-rugged. Everyone sells. Ponzi collapses. Zero.

Eth is a bit of a dinosaur. ..It's tried and failed to find market fit multiple times and is currently primarily used as a base platform for layer 2 projects. ..It's easier to innovate from scratch using first principals than it is to change an existing protocol. ..We're currently on the 3rd generation of Blockchains, which have much better security models and are better abstracted. Ecosystems like Polkadot are a lot more advanced than Eth and have the developer activity to prove it. Devs will always build in the best ecosystems, so it's a good metric to watch. ..Although bitcoin is also a dinosaur, it doesn't need to innovate because it found product market fit in being hyper predictable and extremely hard to charge. The less it moves, the more it's trusted. Those who think it needs to innovate in order to maintain dominance are incorrect.

I suggest researching before posting one of the most basic questions anyone could ask about crypto. We’re here to help but make some effort first.

ETH will be declared a security by the SEC and its value will nosedive as speculators unload. It may still have value as infrastructure lube, but that's it. ETH is not a scam but anyone who says its long term prospects are positive are either scammers or members of the foundation.
-10
Those are all nice buzzwords but when you look at them individually, the claims don't add up.  NFTs haven't done anything beyond allow those running the schemes to make massive profit at the expense of gullible people.
1
Everything you've described is an abstraction...It's like asking, "What is toast good for?" and being told, "Toast is decentralized, programmable nutrition that has terminal security and is the only serious use of flour so far."..Wat?
1
Bitcoin the chain will have a security budget crisis...Bitcoin the asset can easily decouple from its chain, maybe live on a UTXO rollup. Granted that’s only easy technically. Social layer it’d mean war...Bitcoin doesn’t derive its value from the technicalities of its chain. It has first mover and network effects.
12
Bro he literally said he knows absolutely nothing about crypto and you go into a rant about shit he doesn’t understand in the slightest, and you took the time to type all of it out 🤦
39
I think this is just wrong. Why would the security halfen every 4 years? It would already be at zero then, but instead security and hashrate increases with the value of btc each year...I also think it is quite impossible to estimate the money it takes to attack the network so I dont know how you made up the $20B number.

Bitcoins inflation actually goes down with each halving, it’s pretty steady in that regard. Eventually it will be deflationary also. it will be after a few more halvings. It’s current inflation rate is actually less than the US dollar. ..Just wanted to put out the correction as it really isn’t a pro/con vs ethereum.

Would you trust a million dollars to something that is extremely predictable (it doesn't change and the issuance is known), or something that is unpredictable (keeps changing and the issuance is unknown)?..It's obvious what most people think. And that conviction keeps getting stronger.

That ship has sailed with the approval of the Ether ETFs.

As much as I agree in that eth could be deemed a security, it’s not happening .I have faith in the long term infrastructure eth has laid out and I’m not a scammer nor founder

But if the chain gets hacked, you will lose all your Bitcoins, and then it won't matter how valuable Bitcoin becomes because you won't have any.

Great for the rest of us
15
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1
Bitcoin's security is paid with new issuance. That's the incentive to mine. Issuance is halved every 4 years. If price at least doubles every 4 years then security budget is at least constant or growing. If that stops being true, Bitcoin's security is trending to zero...It's impossible for the price of Bitcoin to double every 4 years. At some point it would exceed the total net worth of the Word Economy. Therefore Bitcoin security is cooked.
12
Deflationary how? There is a fixed total supply of 21m bitcoins. When the last bitcoin is mined in the year 2100 something, no more bitcoins will be created but none will be burnt either. ..Unless you mean deflationary as a result of lost bitcoins… then technically yes? xd
8
The deflationary aspect actually makes it pretty lousy for a currency, though at this point I think most people even a lot of BTC maxis are okay with it sitting as the digital store of wealth...There's a reason central banks target small controlled amounts of inflation--it's because you want the money to decrease slightly in value over time to encourage people to spend, consume, and invest, greasing the wheels of the economy. If your currency deflates, suddenly your mattress becomes a great vehicle for investment--why make a risky investment when you can just HODL and gain...Though, perhaps to play devil's advocate, maybe we're approaching the point in history where it's time to stop incentivizing consumption and start to encourage saving. We're obliterating our planet, and that's not sustainable. ..So yeah, deflation currency right at this moment? Pretty dumb. Deflation currency in the future? Maybe it has some merits....So yeah, as of right now: ..HODL'ing BTC == makes sense..Buying a coffee with BTC == throwing away money
3
Technically, Bitcoin's supply will never be deflationary, unless you consider Bitcoin that's permanently lost due to negligence and death, though if you count that, then so many cryptocurrencies are "deflationary"..It's disinflationary until 2140, when it will be neither inflationary nor deflationary. And you totally missed my point about the security budget. I don't care as much about the inflation part as the security part...Lastly, the US dollar, in terms of monetary supply (but in not in terms of purchasing power), is currently deflationary due to quantitative tightening. It actually switches between inflationary and deflationary every several years whenever the monetary policy changes...If you're talking about purchasing power, then that's a pretty moot point since every cryptocurrency's purchasing power changes every day, month, year, etc.
2
No, that's Bitcoin. Top two or three pools own >50% of supply.
3
>It's obvious what most people think...I'm all aboard the crypto train too, don't get me wrong. But "most people" aren't. Half your country's population, or half the world's population, do not own crypto. Or have ever owned crypto..."Most people" do not understand, believe, or own crypto. Most people *here* do, but this is how subreddits work - common interests, echo chambers, etc.
5
If Bitcoin remains ossified, its security will falter. To me, Bitcoin not changing is the biggest bear case against it. There's no chance I'd ever put a million dollars in BTC given its very precarious future.
2
Not sure Ethereum can withstand the onslaught of better protocols.
-4
 Bro we have trillionaires in 2024. Trillionaires. What makes you think the total net worth of the world economy  isn’t exponentially growing in the same manner as crypto? Ten years ago people were saying the same thing you are. Consider that, then have a sip of water.
0
It is the same way that gold is deflationary— fixed supply against value of worth.  Unless at some point people say that BTC has no intrinsic value. I don’t like bitcoin myself,  but this is basic economics.
-6
Finally someone gets it.  ..I do think the deflationary aspect might be BTC downfall though. In the future everyone will hold rather than spend as it will be worth more in the future. .When that happens, it’ll be interesting to see who runs the network. In a future where everyone holds, why secure the network for no incentives. It’ll be interesting if the whales will be the ones who run the network to secure their own wealth. Or if it will all collapse as people run to pull all the money out. And it this case the whales with 1000s of BTC will make the people with 1/1000 of a btc lose their savings overnight. I think short term 5-10 years BTC is good, but the uncertainty future and how the money is already concentrated would scare me long term.

It can evolve if it needs to, but will do only when it's required to. ..If you think bitcoin won't change when it is faced with a threat then you're mistaken.
5
Such as?
2
Doubling every 4 years? Ok, bro
6
Gold is not deflationary. There is a constant supply of gold being mined here on earth, and plenty of near earth asteroids that will be mined in the future.
9
I see what you’re saying. The hard cap introduces scarcity so leads to deflation.
3
Because adoption and use will be first and foremost in third world countries. Where they actually need sound money to live, not to save. ..Inflation to grease the economic wheels is just bs and that's the lie we've been told for years and years. People will always use money. If anything this new monetary politics which bitcoin is, could drasticly help us get rid of the massive spending of earth resources or at least help spread the riches more evenly. Additionally, it could help eliminate many non-productive financial institutions, which seem to take up an increasing share of budgets while contributing nothing but furthering the class divide
2
No, that's the entire point of my reply. Read it again. I did, thinking I missed a key word, but I didn't. I said what I meant.
3
And how do people coordinate such a drastic change to Bitcoin? You need the majority of hashpower onboard for that change, which requires Bircoiners to come to consensus to implement a change to its architecture, such as removing the 21m cap or implementing the capability to perform smart contacts. There's near zero chance this will happen and not be contentious...Also, change doesn't happen in a vacuum. Which developer community is going to get funded to implement these changes? People don't work for free...Absolute delusions and hand waving of big problems, which is typical of Bircoiners...Also, which is it? Your OP comment was saying how great it is that Bitcoin never changes. Now you say it'll change if it has to? Give me a fucking break.

This

I’m not saying all that now. I’m just saying the world keeps turning and the rich get richer. I’m not a fanboi or anything, but I do feel that bitcoin’s security is okay for a good while.

any of them near earth asteroids got btc we can also mine?
2
Is an ounce of gold is worth more now than 20 years ago. Worth more than 50 years ago. Worth more than 100 years ago. Worth more than a thousand years ago. I can buy a lot more with an ounce of gold now than I could in the past. Deflationary. ...The US dollar. I can buy less with one dollar than I could 20 years ago. Even Less now than 50 years ago. Less now than a 100 years ago. Nothing 1000 years ago. Every year I can buy less with the US dollar than I could before. Inflationary.
-6
If you don't get it, I don't have time to explain it to you. ..Bitcoin doesn't care if you understand it or not. It doesn't care about your ignorance either. ..Do some research. ..Tick tock next block.

That's not what inflationary and deflationary mean.

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency with a full computer built on top (the computer runs a bunch of programs called "smart contracts"). That's it.
12
Try https://ethereum.org

There is a channel on Youtube called "Whiteboard Crypto" - it provides 20min animated explanations of many blockchain technologies.  I highly recommend it for beginners to get a very good understanding.   Give it a shot.

Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally just distributed records. What wallets contain what values (of a particular cryptocurrency) is decided by a consensus of those hosting this distributed record. (Sometimes called "miners", or for Ethereum "stakers".)..It's not an easy concept to grasp initially, so don't stress too much if it takes a while to learn. :)

The most decentralized computer in existence

Try crypto Casey on YouTube. Her basics videos are excellent for explaining blockchain to anyone from 4 years old to 104 years old

Just buy on coinbase and hodl. Simple. If you want youtube hardware wallets. Also transfers are similar to sending mail via post office.

Ethereum is a super infrastructure where one can build. Your stake in it is the ETH token.

Blockchain for Dummies is worth a read in this case.

Etherium is not really a crypto currency. It's a block chain for smart contracts, the etherium tokens are just slices of the money tied up in the smart contracts. ..That's literally it hope that helps.

Yea good idea.  Thanks a lot.

piggybacking here, OP, Ethereum ($ETH) also is the utility coin used to pay transaction fees on the network. these transaction fees are in turn paid to node operators who help run the network in a decentralized fashion.

Simple enough. Thanks

WARNING ABOUT SCAMS: Recently there have been a lot of convincing-looking scams posted on crypto-related reddits including fake NFTs, fake credit cards, fake exchanges, fake mixing services, fake airdrops, fake MEV bots, fake ENS sites and scam sites claiming to help you revoke approvals to prevent fake hacks. These are typically upvoted by bots and seen before moderators can remove them. Do not click on these links and always be wary of anything that tries to rush you into sending money or approving contracts....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ignore your DMs, they are all scammers...You should find an L2 that works for you.  Many options.  Base is quite popular.  Arbitrum is very good.  I use Gnosis Chain a lot, but I'm based in Europe and there are advantages (Gnosis Pay debit card, for example)...You should convert (swap) your ETH for rETH.  I recommend CowSwap.  Always make sure you are using the correct address for the app, never click on google searches...Your EOA (Trezor) address will be the same on all Ethereum (EVM) chains, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.  So you can use that account, you just need to switch the network (chain).  To send to another chain, you need to bridge...My recommendation is to start small and play around.  Take 50 USD and play around on an L2.  Try out some apps like Aave, Uniswap, CowSwap, etc.  Just read and do whatever looks interesting.  Do not use DeFi with amounts over 50 USD until you are extremely comfortable.  There will be many hiccups...The best way to learn is to do, but you will make mistakes.  So start small...Good luck.  Self custody is critical, you are doing the right thing.
8
The most important thing to remember is, be prepared to lose everything, at any moment, the first time you screw up.
4
>Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?..You should probably learn about how crypto works fundamentally before doing anything with self custody. The way you talk about moving stuff around shows you don't know how much it costs to do so. I would keep it on the exchange.
1
Do test swaps, buys, transfers of a small amounts before sending a large amount. Wait for it to show up and confirm you have control over it. Worth and gas fee’s to avoid a mistake that can’t be undone...I would just convert ETH to rETH on mainnet, gas fee’s are super low currently. Use a reputable defi exchange. Such as sushiswap or uniswap...You cannot swap ETH for BTC while in self custody, these are different blockchains. Possible on a centralized exchange, like coinbase...Given your very beginner questions, I would consider just holding on an exchange and staking there. I’d say its more risky for you to do the above solo versus the risk of losing your crypto to an exchange meltdown or hack..Just my two cents. Good luck.
1
What are the disadvantages of holding ethereum with coinbase?
1
Appreciate the detailed reply. ..That's my plain, to use a small amount to test converting to rETH, then bulk to store my bag in rETH, then use small amounts to further learn how L2 works.
3
True, that's the reality. Can't take anything for granted
2
Coinbase can close your account.

Yes it did. It was epoch 309205, slot 9894562. I checked it out and it shows no fee recipient address. ..I think that may have gotten messed up somehow. Avado has a withdrawal address dapp that I thought took care of that.  I guess it didn’t. I manually entered it. .Thank you.
2
Yes, beaconcha.in shows the fee recipient shows as `Null address` so I guess you haven't set your fee recipient. .https://beaconcha.in/slot/9894562..The fee recipient is distinct from the withdrawal address, which is where profits generated on the consensus chain get sent (although you can use the same address for both if you want to).

Assuming you're on mainnet, $11 should be enough for 3 to 4 swaps at the moment.  On most L2's maybe 50 or more swaps....So what is exactly telling you don't have enough ETH? And what is vista?
2
There's a gas fee
1
Maestro Bot, Metamask, and the swap app on the site were telling me insufficient fees/transaction reverted when trying to sell Vista. I added a bit more eth to the account and the error message simply moved from the site to metamask and Maestro lol..Vista is available on their site, ethervista.app. Pretty newly launched, skyrocketed in the first couple days now it's been selling off. Was ~$35.55 yesterday, today it's been hovering around $20 per token
1
No idea what it is, but this is what I found:...>Contract source code not verified.This token contract has not been verified. We cannot check the contract code for details. Unsourced token contracts are likely to have malicious functions to defraud users of their assets....So I maybe it's just a scam, and the token can't be traded?
3
The bot and metamask are certainly adding a fee on top, not sure if that pushes it over the amount you have or not
1
Nah there has been a lot of sales, like millions in volume just the past day...I'm still trying to figure out if it's fees or what
0
It looks like it's ethervista that has added a $10 buy/$15 sell fee to the token, at least according to Banana Gun Bot...If you check out the token launcher on ethervista.app you can set custom taxes on the tokens you launch...I tweeted at them to clarify if they have those taxes on the token and they never responded..
1
Assuming this is the token contract:...https://etherscan.io/token/0xc9bca88b04581699fab5aa276ccaff7df957cbbf...It looks like swaps are executed for less than $2, not sure though.
1
Banana Gun Bot us saying $10 buy fee and $15 sell fee..
1
I guess that's a fee the bot charges you then, as the Ethereum network fees are much lower at the moment.

Title: Why Aren't There More Junior Smart Contract Developer Positions?

1
Because smart contracts have a lot of potential security risks and also because they don’t take a huge amount of work. There is no room for a junior to bumble around making mistakes in contracts that could end up being hacked and costing the company a fortune. The developers getting the work are usually contractors that really know their stuff and regularly also do audits and bug bounties. They come in and smash out solid well written contracts and move into the next thing. If you want to get into this field I suggest building some of your own contracts as well as participating in some bug bounties until you solve some and can prove you understand contract security.
24
They are looking for ppl to teach them, not the other way around.
12
A lot of the firms that are hiring are impatient. They need stuff built immediately, and you want senior staff to do that. The last thing you want is to have to hand hold juniors while you're trying to race ahead with a smart contract infrastructure...They don't see it as their job to train people...It's not that different from the industry in general, it's hard to get on the ladder.
9
When I started learning Solidity I didn't trust myself to deploy to mainnet for a year. I worked around it by doing wanky private blockchain projects for banks as was the fashion in those days...One thing I would suggest is to get really good at unit tests, just start writing them and contributing them to projects. You can write them in Solidity using Foundry. Everybody needs them and it's one thing you can usefully entrust to an inexperienced dev. Hopefully you'll also find bugs which will enhance your credentials and may also lead to bug bounties.
9
Because juniors make pretty expensive mistakes, in the order of millions of dollars. High entry barrier is there for a reason. Why should anyone be allowed to be a web3 security developer? The answer is: they shouldn't.
4
I can give you the why, if this is sustainable is a different topic...Why would it be the obligation of a company to have junior roles so that other companies down the line can profit from it? The blockchain business is highly volatile and training someone if the majority of the projects just survive for 2 years wouldn't make financial sense when the risk of a screw up is potentially an insolvency risk...You either need to get extremly lucky for some of the bigger companies to have job offerings or look for a different branch and just work on a project yourself to gain experience. If you create a dapp you will have something to show.
2
It is very dangerous to hire juniors for that. You need to be senior programmer to start programming smart contracts.
2
I wouldn’t say working with smart contracts (security or engineering) is an “entry level” role. For me to get into this industry a while back it was more of a side hustle first for the first year or two..and no it didn’t pay well money wise despite the job market and all the six figure salaries. But booooyyyy did I learn a ton in that time and grew heaps as a technical professional. So I suggest you start with a side hustle in the space. Good luck!
2
The job market for developers is over saturated now, on any area/language (after pandemic adjustment).
1
Smart contracts are extremely demanding to write. I wouldn’t let a junior anybody near my code...Junior devs working on smart contracts are probably the reason there are so many hacks...Smart contracts are simply not a field to ever “start” in. I’ve known C++ for decades, written assembly language, and programmed computers and embedded devices that had just 16kB RAM. These are the kinds of experiences that prepare you for writing EVM code...Not to mention that solc is the biggest pile of garbage compiler I have ever used in my 30-year career. It’s incredibly difficult and frustrating to use and debug, and EVM toolchains are about 40 years behind the state of the art. It’s like programming in 1985. More than 10 years have passed and we still don’t have a 1.0 compiler. Not even fixed point math FFS. I could rant all day about the junior devs who decided they were qualified to write the solc compiler…..I’ve allowed two other people to touch my smart contract code and both of them are capable of rewriting solc and the EVM itself. That’s the level you need for complex innovative projects. Have a look at Uniswap v3 code at the FullMath library for example. Nevermind being able to implement that yourself… Do you understand _why_ they had to do all that? And then there’s also a square root implementation using the Byzantine method...
1
because all senior contract developers are busy sucking out money out of ETH, apparently. No time to teach
0
Aren’t there test suites for smart contracts like other programming environments that can reveal bugs and such? Or do senior level contract coders just send it with abandon?
-1
This is a great apprentice to journeyman approach
2
OP ignore this jerk. He’s just being discouraging...It’s not hard for any dev to start playing around with the EVM!  I’d recommend using Foundry for a baseline toolchain. You can create simple scripts or test cases in solidity and run them against a private fork for free!  Start out with some example code from Uniswap to trade using their SwapRouter contract. Then the rest is up to your imagination! Have fun!!
11
Too much gatekeeping. If your code base actually has unit test coverage then it's fine to let juniors develop whatever they can. If you're not setting juniors up to be successful that's your fault.
3
not really, no. There exist static analysis tools, but they aren't the end all be all. Nothing beats a manual audit.
3
If you need a smart contract with basic features you just take it off the shelf, pre-tested...Its when you're writing some custom stuff you also need to write a test suite to go with it and someone always has to audit that to make sure you didn't miss anything.
1
Yeah I agree anyone can play with the EVM. Doesn't mean anyone should be working in web3 professionally.
6
If only the PenPie project did more gatekeeping. After another $25m in innocent people’s money going missing today, I read through their audits. Some of the issues found were facepalms and I’m not surprised there was a bug that got through...But good for them! They didn’t listen to the arrogant naysayer on Reddit who was trying to gatekeep smart contract development. We should let any idiot code multimillion dollar projects! It’s only fair!
1
IMO it’s naive to think test cases would provide anywhere near enough coverage to properly police someone who’s in over their head.
0
That’s the problem with test cases.
2
You're not special bro, just stop.

You're not going to find as much on Reddit anymore as it seems it's been taken over by bots and memes. I think people moved to farcaster and maybe discord...You're best bet is to find videos from devcon or other developer conferences as attending them in person might not be feasible for you...I would also look at what they are building in Argentina or other places around the world as they have a real need for an alternative financial system. Bankless recently did an episode on this...The big thing right now is zero knowledge proofs and privacy (not anonymity) for B2B transactions. Look up Starlight and nightfall by EY/Paul Brody. Tokenizing real world assets, especially traditional financial instruments and stablecoins are another...If anyone else has suggestions, would love to hear them.

Well while you're here a good place to look would be the stickied thread, which is an AMA with developers and researchers from the Ethereum Foundation:..https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/ama_we_are_ef_research_pt_12_05_september_2024/..More generally, there's a couple of excellent  wiki type sites: ..https://inevitableeth.com/..and..https://epf.wiki/#/README?id=protocol-wiki..Then if you really want to get to grips with the cutting edge of zk tech then a good place to start is listening to the Zero Knowledge podcast and then using the guests there to build up a list of people to follow:..https://zeroknowledge.fm/

Open a fresh X account and start looking for the ETH/defi community there. All of the builders are there, and it's the best way to learn about what's going on. Just don't fall into the scam of following the huge accounts that are always shilling sh1tcoins or doing fake giveaways, and look for accounts that actually share some value.

Twitter, Farcaster. Follow devs, not influencers. Posts are boring, no moon shot posts, just tech talk

SEARCH: "tech stack for blockchain" and also ask the robot. With each robot response will be more concepts to digest. Then go out to the net and start searching. Most of it is superficial erroneous garbage but some is first rate...Sources:..Saylor academy..Glassnode..Messari..Swan bitcoin..River..  .This will get you started. Happy hunting.

I'm afraid in practice the original shared sequencing might not happen, because of L2 (centralized) sequencers have no economic incentive to just give up the income from independently sequencing.....Espresso has therefore shifted away to basically building a market where L2 sequencers put the sequencing rights of certain slots on sale. Buyers who bought the rights can then match user demands across multiple L2s and get the best profitable result. Still kind of a solution to the same problem but not with the original means.....Ref: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCcvogmz8ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCcvogmz8ok)

Why do you expect ETH to increase in value over time? I get that BTC is limited in number, but ETH is not. I see the utility value of ETH whereas BTC is scarce (and probably only reason it’s worth anything). I’m still trying to find reasons why ETH should be expected to gain value and is a good investment. Convince me!

Same, all in on ETH. Glad to know I'm not the only one. ..Actually, I have maybe 10% in alts, but that's my gambling money.

5 to 1 btc to eth.. but slowly unwinding the eth into btc....2 reasons.1. There was basically zero news or coverage when ETFs went live. This isn't mea culpa price didn't go how I expected but literally in the mainstream public NOBODY CARES about eth in proportion to btc. And this matters because while btc can just be fine dormant, eth is meant to be a functional utility coin..2. I tried to start an eth node to help and learn a bit more. Until I saw the system requirements and just couldn't make it work. It's literally data center only cutting edge hardware requires... this feels wrong....So I'm not panic selling, but unless something changes I'll have unwound my eth in favor of btc over the next 3 months.

The USD is used for all kinds of human trafficking, fraud, and money laundering too, wheres the crusade against that? The entire federal reserve system is fraudulent at its very core as its not backed by anything nor does it serve as a true store of value. Something being a fraud would mean someone is creating the fraud and someone else is getting defrauded, how can you be defrauded as someone who is attesting and participating in the decentralized network. Meanwhile the Fed prints dollars at whim to send to foreign nations and mega defense corporations without any voter consent or approval.

I'm 50/50 on ETH and BTC...0 ETH..0 BTC..I'm all-in on: real estate, stocks that pay dividends, S&P ETFs and various other personal collectables that give me pleasure and aren't stress-inducing, like worrying whether or not "the market" has collapsed on any given day...You people that go all-in on crypto... that's a very expensive way to learn a lesson that is much cheaper to learn if you simply refine your critical thinking skills.

The potential increase in supply is insignificant (even less than btc supply inflation), and there's demand for defi, and burn of fees. ... When demand goes up, it will quickly be larger than the supply, like we've seen in several bull markets already.

> It's literally data center only cutting edge hardware requires... this feels wrong...It really isn't, where are you getting this stuff? I have an Ethereum node sitting on the shelf right next to me. You can run one on any normal computer with a large SSD drive. If it doesn't come with a large SSD drive you can buy one for about $150 and plug it in.

Just as an aside, I’ve been considering this as well. Is that considered a taxable event?

That is literally the most unlikely scenario going forward. There is NO demand for defi. Retail is never going back to that shit. Eth supply is truly infinite on top of the fact Eth foundation is dumping Eth heavily. No way on earth demand outstrips the supply are you kidding? Lol.
1
Nobody is actually trying to store value in BTC. People buy it because they want it to go up. If you store something, your goal is to be able to take out about the same amount that you put in. ..Gold sort of accomplishes this because it has consuming demand, ie people use it for electronics and jewelry etc, and flexible supply, ie if the demand goes up production also goes up and if the demand goes down production goes down. BTC doesn't have this. The price varies wildly and is impossible to predict. ..An asset that people only want to buy because it goes up, but which has negative expected value, is a bad idea. It's mathematically guaranteed to fail the average investor, although we don't know over what timescale the failure will occur.

Guys with limited empathy.  Who only recognize reasons to be motivated when there's personal material interests involved.  I can't reach you.  You lack the basic level of empathy to understand that not everybody thinks that way.  I'm not "mad" at crypto or upset because I lost money.  Not at all.  Not everybody is motivated in that respect.  Talk to your therapist about APD.  Getting help not only might help you, but also other people you try to have relationships with.

Thanks for your concern. ..I'm doing fine.  I enjoy discussing and debating certain subjects that I'm familiar with and passionate about.  As a software engineer, I like to talk about new and disruptive tech, but when tech appears pretending to be new and disruptive, but really isn't, that kinda bothers me. And when that tech enables a lot of bad stuff like money laundering and human trafficking and fraud, if I can call attention to that, I think it's a good thing.  I don't "hate" crypto.  I just think it's fraud, and fraud is bad and I want to educate people about that to make the world a little bit less fraudulent...You guys are the ones that we should be asking, "You ok bro?"   You seem to be throwing away good value into a scheme that really isn't going to make neither you, nor the world in which you live, better off.  So somewhere along the way, you've been brainwashed and that's not good.

Similar to me, I bought 2 when they were 300 because someone was telling me the earning potential is higher than BTC. I cashed 0.5 when it got to 1500 to recoup all my costs but I wished I'd stuck with it and of course bought more...I'm 1/3 ETH, 1/3 BTC and 1/3 DOT.

The adornment and industrial value of gold is a small percentage of its total value, I’m pretty sure like 1/3. People buy gold because it’s a hedge against inflation, same as bitcoin. ..Yes, they want it to go up to safeguard them from their fiat dollar that’s losing its value. Short-medium term trading is what lots of people do but it’s a perfectly capable vehicle to see massive numbers if you keep DCA’ing in a smart way (not just fomo’ing in at cycle tops then panic selling at a loss) and holding for decades ..It hadn’t failed so far, zoom out and it’s only going up since its inception against a fiat dollar denominator. ..The world that Bitcoin is much higher, gold is much higher, silver is higher, etc. will also be a world where a Big Mac meal is $20 or more inevitably. The finite supply of Bitcoin makes it an agreeable vehicle for investors to park their wealth, and it will become more-so acceptable over time as it siphons the market cap out of other assets. ..Of course it’s speculative in the zone where it becomes that acceptable asset class, but over time as older generations pass their wealth to younger generations, I think they would rather hold much more crypto. The gambit is the scenario I mentioned playing out, and I believe it’s a sound thesis given the potential inflation of fiat currency we could experience in coming years-decades. Only will ever be 21,000,000 Bitcoin. No ceiling to the fiat denominator it’s valued in.

If a company never pays any dividend still people buy them for growth. Consider crypto currencies in the same category. Maybe you can consider them in the foreign currency trading category. Idk but 15 years is long enough to prove its not ponzi or sth. Any speculative movements or ponzis never live that long. What is its utility? ..You buy because if something happens government can not get it from you..You can send money abroad. .Halvings help its being scarce. Better than gold..You want honesty? Governments control supply of gold we dont know unsystematically always changes. But for btc its kind of programmed. Banks can get your money and give them as loan. Bitcoin is honest. Bitcoin does not give more reward to miners because a miner is a friend of founder or does not get less fees because you know someone in the bank. Decentralization is a growing trend.

I did specify to help and learn. But even a trimmed down node is no joke (but wouldn't serve my purpose anyway).

> If a company never pays any dividend still people buy them for growth. Consider crypto currencies in the same category...They're not in the same category, because with stocks you actually own shares in a real company that actually produces useful products and services.  Crypto has no such attributes.  It creates nothing of value.  The only value crypto has is via *coercion* and marketing.  ..I am not a fan of buying shares of companies that don't share profit as dividends.  I get that there are other things they can do with the extra money, but it goes against the spirit of how the stock market was originally designed.  ..Crypto is like an amplification of all the worst attributes of the modern market: exclusive focus on speculation and not actual profit sharing...>15 years is long enough to prove its not ponzi or sth...Bernie Madoff's ponzi lasted just as long, if not longer...Time frame has no bearing on whether a fraud is a fraud...>You buy because if something happens government can not get it from you...That's [totally false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=3943s)...>You can send money abroad. ..That's [also false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4118s)...>Halvings help its being scarce...Scarcity is not a guarantee of increased value...>Better than gold. You want honesty? Governments control supply of gold we dont know unsystematically always changes. But for btc its kind of programmed..Government policies change as a result of public consensus via elected representatives and a de-facto Constitution.  Crypto policy has no such "constitution" nor a legitimate consensus mechanism...There are less than 10 people who control the code for both Bitcoin and Eth.  They can do whatever they want with the code.  And you can't stop them.  You can choose to disregard the system they create if you don't like what they do, but you don't have any real influence, unlike in traditional society where you can actually remove people from political office via elections...The notion that crypto is more honest is totally false.  It's quite the opposite.  If Vitalik decided to change the way Eth works, you have no way to remove him from a position of power and influence.  All you can do is choose to abandon his ecosystem.  That's not much "honesty" or "freedom".   We could say the same thing about a totalitarian state: if you don't like the way China is run, you can smuggle yourself out of the country.  Not really that decent an option though.   Whereas with traditional western government, you have the ability to vote and laws that protect your interests.  You have no such assurances in the world of crypto.  Code doesn't protect you, and you don't have control over those who have access to the repository.  Sure, you can create your own fork of crypto, but it's largely no more useful than declaring your living room is a new country.  Nobody will respect your claims...>Decentralization is a growing trend...Decentralization is an ambiguous buzzword that is meaningless...Every good thing in our society is a function of collaboration and centralization.  Every time something chaotic, dangerous and unpredictable happens, it's more likely the result of "decentralization" and lack of proper management.  The same goes for crypto.  Decentralization is not the feature you think it is.  It's merely an excuse to defraud people and pretend since nobody is in charge, nobody can be held accountable for the fraud.
2
> If a company never pays any dividend still people buy them for growth...You don't buy stocks just because you want to hold something that's growing. You buy them because you expect that you (or whoever you sell the stock to) will get paid in the form of either dividends or buybacks. A buyback is economically equivalent to a dividend: The company takes the surplus cash that it created from profits and instead of giving it to all shareholders equally, it gives it to the shareholders that want cash now, and increases the proportion of the company held by the shareholders who don't want to take cash out right now...ETH has the equivalent to a buyback in the form of the gas fee burn, but BTC doesn't have anything like this: Fees are paid to miners, but they don't go to BTC holders, and most of that money doesn't even end up with the miner. In addition since you have to print BTC every block, you're constantly doing the opposite of a buyback: You're taking money from the holders and using it to pay operating costs...PS a company may not be distributing any profits *now*, but you still hold it because you expect it to distribute profits later. This is pretty common when a company is in growth mode: You want it to reinvest all its profits now in the hope of extracting bigger profits later.

A normal node is not "trimmed down", it's the entire blockchain and the entire state. An archive node is that, plus a massive index for fast retrieval of data calculated from that for every single block. An archive node is hardly ever useful, in most cases where a normal full node isn't enough you're better off with a custom index like a subgraph or something.

I personally want decentralization truly happens. I get irritated when companies or banks give less fees or charge less price to the people they know or to the people who are in politics etc. Its not fair. In the future ai is going to manage the companies and probably those ai entities wont be decentralized but i wish it was. Thats why i like someone who created bitcoin because its honest as a system. If it can be changable as a system by satoshi or third parties some people should try to create better decentralized alternatives because i know btc is also not scalable enough. Its not perfect but he made the first step. Democracies are just result of media manipulation and previous culture invading the country. Its easily manipulated. Hitler got elected. Candidates can easliy hide their intentions or their mind can change after they are elected. I am not sure if bitcoin's decentralized system can be changed by satoshi or third parties. If it is not i support it. If it can be changable i support the industry because they can create it. I think when ai is developed enough to create companies and serve as an entity, decentralization will be easier. I understand you think decentralized systems wont change but change will need. In that case, i think we will be able to decentralize that change process as well. It will be doable by ai... If a cryptocurrency is not fully decentralized like ethereum you are right. But there is no way governments can get your money in bitcoin in self custody wallet. Only some physical things they can do like searching your home to find your wallet key. They can force centralized entities like usdt.  You are right about vitalik. There is that risk. They cant change bitcoin though as far as i know. If you are a software engineer tell me if they can change bitcoin system's code if satoshi or governments can change it...For the current situation of bitcoin and ethereum, they are store of value. For btc its volume is increasing in long term and its adoption is enough that now television shows its price under the screen. Risk is mostly gone. Etfs are created so that people wont need to trust crypto exchanges. For ethereum you must trust vitalik same as companies. Think of it like you buy gold and you trust governments they wont mine unexpectedly more. For eth its riskier of course. ..Lets say in the future a company that is managed by ai and also it expands its factory etc optimally by its financials is created. You can buy that companies' shares and its major decisions are done by itself or by shareholders' votes. If president comes it will sell the product to him for same price. They cant pump their amortisation to pay less taxes and decrease profit. They can not give some huge salaries to people they know in the company and show decreased net income. Thats why decentralization is important. We just see its first steps. Some people prefer it. With ai, it will be able to be done truly. I would think same about decentralization if ai wouldnt be serious...An advice: when market is low gradually buy riskier assets like tesla. When market is high relative to long term sp 500 growth path, gradually buy safer assets like apple. Never get in the cash. Even if companies bankrupt, government will help and bull run will start its higjly cyclical and your return will be higher in riskier assets. I am also a value investor i just got in crypto to maximize profit as it is one of the riskiest assets. The fundamental risk of bitcoin and eth are gone its matured enough i think.

Bitcoin has buyback effect because of lack of heritage system. Someone loses wallet key, sends to wrong address or just dies and provide a buyback effect. It is still valid for eth but i dont compare them. Also its known that there are only 21 million of them. ..Thanks for buyback perspective i never thought about it. Its helpful.
1
Oh interesting! OK perhaps lets reverse this question...If I wanted to do things like research like accumulations, tracking down transaction stats over time etc. What do you think I should try to run?
1
> Someone loses wallet key, sends to wrong address or just dies and provide a buyback effect...Well, the average investor is losing the average amount of bitcoins so you still have a negative expected return for the average investor.
1
Lost wallets are estimated to be almost %20 of total supply..Effects if you invest are:  difference in total money supply+ crypto currencies growth rate as industry+ btc's own growth+ us inflation rate - new btc supply +  lost crypto currencies - fees..General effects seems fine. Expected return is positive. Even only supply difference between us dollar and btc creates it. Only industry growth would hike the expected return more than sp 500.

I don't understand the question. This happens all the time. 99% of contracts are copy-cats of another idea.
8
If it's a contract that just interacts with you, like a wallet or something, then sure, copy away...If it's a contract in which you interact with other users, like a token exchange, then you use that one because that's where all the other users are. Someone could copy it and try to get their own users, but it's hard to compete that way unless they make significant improvements, and then it's not just a copy anymore.
5
The answer is the community and development team...Just because something is opensource, doesn't mean it's "free". This is why it's important to support projects and teams that actively maintain a project and/or community that you get value/utility out of it...With regards to another part of your question are standards. For instance, you'll find a lot of code and contracts that have been standardized on Openzeppelin. Which is awesome, as it reduces the barrier of entry. But at the end of the day, a copy cat project will fail because it doesn't have the support of the community and development team behind it with properly aligned incentives.

One hard part is the code, but you can copy that. The more difficult part is convincing people to use your Zoo when they can use the 'original' Bar.

Ignore whatever is going on onchain. Who knows or cares (for this situation) how Binance manages their funds...All that matters is what Binance tells you your balance is when you log in.

[ryanberckmans](https://x.com/ryanberckmans) from Twitter asks:..> The Base L2 has been raising their gas limit regularly and is now 1% of the way to their goal of 1 Giga gas per second. What target blob count is needed to support this goal, and on what timeline might we reach that? Of course, there is a lot more to the L2 ecosystem than Base, but it's interesting to consider how many blobs we need if base buys 100% of them to reach their goal. personally, my unsubstantiated supposition is that Base will convert into a validium or volition after OP Stack adopts zk.

Ethereum has great potential, but it is very complex to understand, both technically and economically.

1. As succinctly as possible, what is the value accrual thesis for ETH the asset in 2024?..2. Does the EF consider continuous value accrual to ETH the asset important? Can you briefly explain why..3. If executing on the rest of the roadmap results in a diverse ecosystem of rollups settling on Ethereum L1, with a multitude of dapps on L2s and sub-cent fees for users, but little to no value accrual to ETH the asset, would the EF consider this a successful implementation of the Ethereum roadmap?

[ShitShotDead](https://x.com/ShitShotDead) from Twitter asks:..> Are there any concerns regarding the current blob base fee mechanism for blobs? In my mind, base fee for mainnet works because the demand for blockspace can be very elastic, which is not the case for L2s that uses blobs. L2s can compress transactions into blobs up to a certain maximum, they can also only delay posting blobs to a certain period before they lose their liveness. When all this is saturated they will eventually have to post blobs/calldata no matter what the gas price is. Feels like due to this, blob gas fee will either only be 1 wei or at a certain point, trend so high that it becomes restrictive for L2s to post blobs/calldata.

Something I don't understand about the idea of "exiting to L1" in the case of L2 failure is that unless the L2 is EVM equivalent (and even then), your exit isn't really getting everything out because the rollup ecosystem will be incompatible with the EVM. Doesn't this imply that it is necessary to continue scaling and upgrading the L1 so that L2s don't feel that being EVM equivalent is a burden, and exiting to L1 remains a credible threat against misbehaving sequencers?..Alternatively, doesn't this mean that "exiting to L1" isn't actually a thing, and L2 censorship resistance actually depends on sequencer decentralization (which if I understand correctly, no one has really figured out how to do yet)?..Another question: I remember seeing a tweet the other day that crypto is actually the most insider-y scene in tech.

Possible some gain from Verkle Tree's or will it likely not happen until a fully snark'd ETH and what kind of improvements do you think we could expect?..Also just want to point out i am fully in favor of the Layer-2 roadmap just a little confused on where Layer-1 stands now.

I find app-level sequencing to be a critical factor in future of Ethereum. This is because users are the primary customers of decentralized applications, while these apps, in turn, are the customers of the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) network...Given this relationship, I believe Ethereum should position itself as the premier platform for app developers. The network's features, scalability, and developer tools should cater to creating the best possible environment for building and deploying apps. This is also a good mechanism for order agnostic apps. It also fits with the idea of execution auctions (app/based rollups will be able to buy blockspaces) which I really appreciate the efforts in this regard...If app developers choose L2s, a significant value is lost from L1. Could a mechanism such as MEV tax (similar to Optimism - Base) be employed by sequencers for this purpose? This is because in the single sequencing environment of L2s, users consistently get rekt and being the main value extraction source...What do you think of these ideas in general?

Jannik asks:..> Thanks for doing this AMA! I was wondering what your counter for the following type of argument would be: The reason Ethereum is paying billions of dollars a year for a very large validator set is not because it needs so much economic security (pretty much all applications could survive with orders of magnitudes less), but rather to get a minimal level of validator "diversity" (no single entity has that much ETH, not even the biggest CEXes). However, permissionless depositing is a very inefficient mechanism to get diversity, having some sort of enshrined governance mechanism would be a lot cheaper. Of course, we don't really want governance because it's susceptible to social attacks, but in practice a majority of the stake is governed anyway, just one layer removed in staking pools, so it seems Ethereum is getting the worst of both worlds. Instead, Ethereum could save billions of dollars every year at little (if any) loss of security by selecting validators using a "good" social validator selection mechanism.

It has been some time since there was a publication on ethresearch about economic incentives and the sustainability of Ethereum.

Q1. What are "Ephemeral Chains"? When I hear the term I think of it possibly referring to ability to automatically spin up a fresh L2 to enable a computation involving multiple users, for example a game lets say, that would run and then only the final result (eg. ranking of players and minting and distribution of NFTs), returns to the parent chain and the middle transactions are discarded. Does this pattern make sense for computations where only the end result matters?..Q2. Is there any current R&D to do high computation dapps like what Truebit was aiming for? What are the challenges in making this possible?..Q3. If an VM were to be built from scratch today based on everything that was learnt in the past 10 years, I feel it would have to be launched on Ethereum since it has established network effects to have a good chance of adoption.

Why does the EF continually enshrine Eigenlayer even though, from the looks of it, it's a very straight forward protocol that could be built by EF themselves in a couple of weeks?

Can you name one specific, non-criminal thing that Ethereum does that's better than existing, non-blockchain technology?..(This also precludes Ethereum offering a service within its own ecosystem that doesn't apply anywhere else)..If you expect this technology to be adapted, then it should be able to answer what i call, "The Ultimate Crypto/Tech Question" above.  Every other disruptive technology that's ever been adopted can easily answer this question.  We're 15 years into blockchain tech and still, nobody has answered this question.   Note that vague arguments like "It's decentralized" are not specific.  Nobody walked into a bank and ever said, "I want to open a decentralized checking account please."..So, can you answer the question?

I actually don't think rollups decentralizing the sequencer is necessarily top priority. To me, it would be okay short term and medium term to instead focus on:..1. Having a working force-inclusion channel (this makes the L2 inherit the L1's censorship resistance).2. Getting to [stage 2](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) (fully trustless, any security council can intervene only in the event of a provable bug, eg. two proving systems that are supposed to be equivalent disagree, or a proving system accepts two different post-state roots for the same block)

About 3. I definitely understand all these acronyms can become a bit confusing, I’ll give it a try and succinctly define the ones you mentioned:..* **ePBS (enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation)**: The main objective is to get rid of needing to trust third-parties (i.e., relays) to mediate interactions between builders and proposers. There is currently an EIP for it here and a lot of work is being done: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732).* **Execution Tickets (ETs)** and **Execution Auctions (EAs)** are two proposals that fall under the broader concept of **Attester-Proposer Separation (APS)**. The goal is to further separate consensus roles (e.g., proposing, attesting) to prevent negative externalities caused by MEV, such as timing games that destabilize consensus..* **Inclusion lists** **(ILs)** are all about improving the censorship resistant properties of the network by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in blocks (and constrain builders). There has been quite a lot of progress on that front, and I think our most recent proposal, FOCIL ([https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870)), is a good candidate!.* **BRAID** is a recent idea put forward by Max Resnick: In short, it aims to both  improve CR and "solve MEV" by having multiple proposers run parallel chains simultaneously. I recently wrote a note comparing FOCIL and BRAID here: [https://x.com/soispoke/status/1828744089463820490](https://x.com/soispoke/status/1828744089463820490).* **PEPC (Protocol-Enforced Proposer Commitments)**: “PEPC is intended as an enshrined protocol gadget allowing validators (”proposers”) to enter into binding commitments over the blocks they produce.” This is taken from Barnabé's PEPC-FAQ here: [https://efdn.notion.site/PEPC-FAQ-0787ba2f77e14efba771ff2d903d67e4](https://efdn.notion.site/PEPC-FAQ-0787ba2f77e14efba771ff2d903d67e4) .* **MEV-share**: This refers to a solution provided by Flashbots to send your transactions to their RPC instead of the public mempool to prevent MEV extraction and potentially receive kickbacks from the MEV generated. Note that it’s centralised (you have to trust Flashbots) and is out-of-protocol.

Hey! About 3., I would encourage you to check out this [note](https://efdn.notion.site/Block-construction-session-bd611621250f45948eff05fcf6a34067) produced last month in support of an internal research meet. For ePBS, we started a [tracker](https://efdn.notion.site/ePBS-EIP-7732-tracker-9f85f7b086994bd79192bc72bae703a1?pvs=74) which we are working on expanding with new material as questions come up...More generally, I feel like there are two "movements" to current MEV protocol research. There are somewhat concrete protocol upgrade proposals such as ePBS and FOCIL (committee-based/multi-prop-style inclusion lists) which are discussed, and then larger directions such as APS (a broad concept around execution tickets/auctions) or Braid. I personally hope that the concrete work informs the more speculative one.

I do believe that scaling L1 execution should be a goal, in parallel to building out rollups. However, they do not have to be in conflict:.. \* Data availability can be scaled almost unlimited -- the ultimate limitation is the interest in Ethereum (i.e. how many people are seriously running full nodes and how many are willing to record all data)... \* Execution will always be a bit more limited, the ultimate limit is the single-thread limit; at the moment, state access is the direct limitation on scaling L1 execution..With zkEVMs and parallelization I still think we will see scaling the L1 to 10-1000x the current capacity. Rollups will provide the remainder to reach "world scale"...  .The good news is that all of these are being worked on -- and thanks to the rollup-centric roadmap, by many teams in parallel, in a much more decentralized manner.
19
I see a world lottery being a low-hanging Ethereum application:.. * **fair**: provable randomness. * **global**: world scale. * **rake-free**: close to free! (governments take rake 50%)..I could see a $1B weekly world lottery on Ethereum being a thing :)

im going to build this

Ethereum is currently creating a new market for rollups -- the market for data availability. Many alternative solutions would love to take away market share from Ethereum -- Celestia, Eigenlayer, Avail and others. They can't compete on security, so they would want to compete on price. Do we really want to artificially increase prices now so that one of our biggest asset (secure rollups) moves away from our chain?..At 3 blobs per block, the revenue is never going to make a dent in Ethereum's protocol revenue. I think for the coming years, we should just work hard on scaling this as much as possible. Worry about capturing fees from it later...Either way, I do not believe that fees from blobs will be the best value capture mechanism for Ethereum. The data availability market is too fickle -- while Ethereum provides the best security, it is too easy to get something "close enough" that it will never be a good way to extract value. The Ethereum L1 as the natural financial crossroads in the ecosystem will have the highest value transactions, and I think this provides the best value accrual mechanism for Ether.
35
Blobs won't fail to hit the target—we just need to be patient :) Induced demand takes time to do its magic. Another consideration is that rollup projects (e.g. Base, Scroll, Taiko) recently found ways to better make use of blobs. These rollup optimisations extend—for good reasons!—the timeline to blob price discovery.
26
No, it shouldn't. The mechanism prices congestion so if there is no congestion it is okay for the price to stay low. However, current demand being much lower than the target affects price discovery in situations where there is congestion. For these, price discovery is important and we should make the mechanism more effective, in the short term changes such as a higher (but still very low!) minimum fee or a change to the speed of update can help...See ideas here:  .[https://ethresear.ch/t/eip-4844-fee-market-analysis/15078](https://ethresear.ch/t/eip-4844-fee-market-analysis/15078)..Recent proposal:  .[https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7762-increase-min-base-fee-per-blob-gas/20949](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7762-increase-min-base-fee-per-blob-gas/20949)
20
It would be concerning if blobs we're already in price discovery, that would mean that we failed to scale. Activity is in a steep uptrend, we can let other DA layers compete with Ethereum on price.
11
Today, average block size [is 70 kB](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocksize), and the average block gas consumption is 15 Mgas, so that's 214 gas per byte. So 1 Ggas/sec would require 4.67 MB/sec, which is a few times higher than our stated goal of 1.33 MB/sec for full DAS. If we want to get Base there, there's three paths to this:..1. We work hard to get DA bandwidth even higher than 16 MB/slot. This will require a lot of research and practical work, though it's not at all outside the realm of possibility..2. Base adopts [ideal data compression](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1773356255920230848), which should be able to reduce onchain data consumption by ~7x. This would reduce Base's usage reqs to ~667 kB/sec, which would be exactly half of Ethereum's data capacity..3. Base becomes [a plasma architecture](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/14/neoplasma.html).
14
It's not very easy to answer this question because at the end of the day it depends on the average ratio of gas used to bytes posted on L1, which itself depends on the kind of activity that consumes gas on L2, and the compression ratio achieved for it in practice. Still, we can give it a shot with a bit of guesswork. Let's say we are only considering ERC-20 transfers consuming \~60k gas, and consider the compression discussed [here](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1554983955182809088/photo/1) for such transfers...Then, 1 Ggas/s corresponds to \~16k transfers/s, which in the "ERC-4377 with aggregation" scenario corresponds to \~16 blobs/s, or \~195 blobs/slot, and in the best case of the compression estimates to \~3 blobs/s, or \~36 blobs/slot. In the former case, this would require \~50% more capacity than the 128 blob target that has been a goal for a while, but in the latter case it would only be about 1/4 of that capacity...A perhaps more helpful way to look at it is to just look at current activity. At 10 Mgas/s, Base has consumed 2435 blobs in the last 12 hours at the time of writing, according to [this dashboard](https://dune.com/0xRob/blobs), or \~0.05 blobs/s. Projecting the same usage pattern to 1 Ggas/s, they'd use \~5 blobs/s, or \~60 blobs/slot, somewhere in between the two previous estimates. This intuitively makes sense, as rollups are likely to have quite a bit of more complex activity, which can have a better gas/byte ratio, but on the other hand my understanding is that we are still far from optimal compression (no rollup has stateful compression for one thing). With this kind of activity on average, a DA layer with capacity 128 blobs/slot could support around 2 Ggas/s. In the medium to long term, I think this is bound to improve, though probably not by a huge factor.

I often link to [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/), for both "beginner" and "advanced" content. Part of the team is at the Ethereum Foundation but it is also a community-driven effort...I also think there are excellent resources not from EF members that help people navigate more in-the-weeds topics, such as the "[Infinite Jungle](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/podcasts/infinite-jungle/)" podcast by Christine Kim...Overall there is a lot of content at different levels from different sources, not a single effort at "promotion", but that is also in line with the philosophy of Ethereum as I understand it.

There are SO much content, listen to barnabee. ..If its something that IS NOT lacking its high quality information for all various levels of knowledge imo

.> 1) As succinctly as possible, what is the value accrual thesis for ETH the asset in 2024?..Value accrues to ETH when Ethereum facilitates sustainable economic activity. ..By “sustainable”, I refer to activities that bring utility to participating economic agents, ensuring they continue over the long run. Under such circumstances, value will accrue to the native ETH token, because:..A: ETH is the trustless asset within the Ethereum ecosystem and thus desirable to hold and use as money. ..B: Payments for economic activity settled on/secured by Ethereum are in ETH and are burned, effectively distributing value to all ETH token holders...> 2) Does the EF consider continuous value accrual to ETH the asset important? Can you briefly explain why..The EF might not consider anything, but individual researchers do, and I would suspect that quite a few consider value accrual to ETH as important. One obvious reason is that Ethereum is secured by staked ETH, so value accrual to ETH ensures economic security. Another example is that money should ideally hold its value over time, and ETH is the best possible money of Ethereum. It is valuable to have reliable trustless money in a decentralized economy and value accrual to ETH therefore makes Ethereum a better platform. A third example is that a rather large fraction of future investments into Ethereum’s ecosystem are likely held in ETH. This also includes the EFs (not particularly large) treasury. A fourth example is the meta consideration that value accrual to ETH and the success of Ethereum are deeply linked, as further discussed in the answer to question (3)...> 3) If executing on the rest of the roadmap results in a diverse ecosystem of rollups settling on Ethereum L1, with a multitude of dapps on L2s and sub-cent fees for users, but little to no value accrual to ETH the asset, would the EF consider this a successful implementation of the Ethereum roadmap?..In the long run, there is a direct link between Ethereum facilitating sustainable economic activity and value accrual to ETH. If you design for sustainable economic activity, you are designing for value accrual to ETH. If you wish to design for value accrual to ETH, you must specifically ensure that Ethereum facilitates sustainable economic activity. ..A short-term focus on “value accrual” without consideration as to how and why “value accrues” can hypothetically lead to less value accrual in the long run. In some regard, although it is certainly a sensitive subject and people might get a bit stingy at me for suggesting it, I see the current roadmap also a value accrual roadmap. ..In any case, to answer your specific question, I would personally find the scenario of a successful Ethereum without value accrual to ETH very surprising, perhaps a little disappointing, but also consider it a reason to buy some ETH, since I would expect the market to eventually come around to this thesis.
21
> As succinctly as possible, what is the value accrual thesis for ETH the asset in 2024?..Ethereum is building a financial platform, and it will be by far the most neutral platform that at the same time  . \* allows to issue representations of financial assets  . \* allows trading those assets  . \* and permissionlessly create new financial products, such as derivative, based on them  .in existence...This is all very valuable activity. Capturing value from it is going to be possible, but it is not a priori obvious what the mechanisms are going to be. I still think it is some sort of fee mechanism -- in the rollup roadmap, I do continue to believe that the Ethereum L1 will be the crossroads between all those subdomains, and a lot of very valuable activity will continue to take place on it and that will generate valuable fees. (A decent amount of L1 scaling will be necessary for this to happen)..If this turns out not to be the best value accrual mechanism, then there are interesting alternatives that I consider with an increasing degree of skepticism, but none of them are impossible: Value accrual through data availability fees, as the main medium of exchange asset in the ecosystem, and finally by being used as collateral (which is the riskiest)...> Does the EF consider continuous value accrual to ETH the asset important? Can you briefly explain why.."The EF" does not have an opinion on this, as researchers we all form our own opinions...Personally I believe it is best if we focus on building a value-generating ecosystem on Ethereum, and I think that value capture will ultimately come naturally. This doesn't mean I don't think about it, but it is a great mistake to focus on it while the value generation part is still coming short...> If executing on the rest of the roadmap results in a diverse ecosystem of rollups settling on Ethereum L1, with a multitude of dapps on L2s and sub-cent fees for users, but little to no value accrual to ETH the asset, would the EF consider this a successful implementation of the Ethereum roadmap?..Again, I don't speak for the EF, but I have an individual opinion as a researcher...When I build a startup, of course I would like to make money, but I would still consider it as a success if it was useful to my customers and I ultimately went away empty-handed...Translating this to Ethereum, I do think that if we had a diverse ecosystem of rollups providing the world with interesting applications, I would consider this a success, but an even greater success would be if this ecosystem also made ETH the asset more valuable...I know that many believe that the rollup-centric roadmap will take away fee revenue and MEV from Ethereum and rollups might ultimately be parasitic. I think that's not true. I think that it will continue to be true that the highest-value transactions will happen on Ethereum L1, while rollups will grow the pie by providing plenty of space for users to transact on Ethereum. The relationship will be symbiotic: Ethereum provides rollups with cheap data availability (I think it should be cheap, Ethereum security should be affordable for everyone) and in return they make Ethereum L1 the natural crossroads for all financial activity for the really valuable transactions.
28
> As succinctly as possible, what is the value accrual thesis for ETH the asset in 2024?..ETH is money :)..> Does the EF consider continuous value accrual to ETH the asset important? Can you briefly explain why..My personal opinion is that ETH value accrual is critical to the success of Ethereum. I believe Ethereum cannot be the settlement layer for the internet of value without ETH de facto becoming the internet's programmable money. Monetary premium will only accrue in size (think tens of trillions of dollars) to one special asset. Such monetary premium is required to:.. * underwrite trillions of dollars of decentralised stablecoins ("economic bandwidth"). * provide unquestionable security, even from nation states ("economic security"). * capture the attention of all major economic actors ("economic salience")..> If executing on the rest of the roadmap results in a diverse ecosystem of rollups settling on Ethereum L1, with a multitude of dapps on L2s and sub-cent fees for users, but little to no value accrual to ETH the asset, would the EF consider this a successful implementation of the Ethereum roadmap?..My personal opinion is that ETH value accrual boils down to flows and monetary premium. For flows the important metric is aggregate fees, not per-transaction fees. As described in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZuGVLhhxQo) a successful endgame for Ethereum would be 10M tx/s, providing billions of dollars of daily income even with sub-cent per-tx fees. For example $0.002/tx would provide roughly $2B/day of income. For monetary premium the important metric is the percentage of ETH used as collateral money, e.g. to underwrite defi.
30
The current approximate budget strategy is to spend 15% of our remaining money every year. This implies a default path where the EF lasts forever, but gets smaller and smaller (as a share of the ecosystem) over time.
21
My limited personal understanding is that:.. * A financial report similar to [this one](https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf) should be out relatively soon.. * The EF spends roughly $100M/year—see [this tweet by Aya](https://x.com/AyaMiyagotchi/status/1827219654999470258).. * At current prices [the EF's main Ethereum wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae) holds roughly $650M. . * The EF has a fiat buffer to cover a couple of years of runway. (This is the part I have the least visibility on. As Aya mentioned ETH sales were temporarily paused for regulatory reasons so the buffer wasn't replenished until recently.). * At rough first approximation the EF has a 10-year runway. This runway varies considerably with ETH price.

The long-term sustainable and elegant plan is to use the magic of SNARKs to scale L1 EVM execution, essentially without limits...With real-time L1 EVM SNARKing attesters can verify cheap SNARKs instead of naively reexecuting EVM transactions. This would allow us to increase the gas limit by orders of magnitude without burdening validators. All the heavy EVM execution would happen outside of consensus by specialised nodes operated by entities like searchers, builders, explorers. Users and consensus participants would have it easy, e.g. running their nodes on phones or watches...Besides the vertical scaling benefits from dramatically increasing the L1 EVM gas limit, there is an opportunity for arbitrary horizontal scaling using an EVM-in-EVM precompile to cheaply verify EVM execution within the EVM. This precompile would allow developers to programmatically spin up new L1 EVM instances, unlocking a supercharged version of execution sharding where the number of shards is unbounded (rather than capped to 64 or 1024 shards) and individual shards are programmable rollups (with programmable governance, sequencing, gas) known as "native rollups"...A few notes:.. * **calldata**: SNARKs do not help with calldata. We would want a separate EVM gas limit for calldata.. * **state**: If we want to cap state growth we would also need a separate EVM gas limit for opcodes that growth state. (My intuition is that we may not need a state growth cap given state handled is relatively cheap and would be done by sophisticated entities.). * **physical limits**: L1 EVM execution has physical limits to vertical scaling that would be hit even if we completely removed the gas limit. The good news is that projects like MegaETH claim to be able to push the EVM to 100,000 TPS (roughly 10,000x more than L1 today) so there are likely several orders of magnitude for the L1 EVM to grow. EVM performance optimisations Reth, Monad and others will eventually pay off at L1.. * **diversity**: For validators to safely ditch their execution client and rely on SNARKs instead of naive reexecution we would need zkEVM client diversity to hedge against SNARK bugs. Fortunately (and coincidentally) there is roughly the same diversity with zkVM vendors (Risc0, Succinct, Jolt, Valida, Nexus) as there is with execution clients.. * **formal verification**: Another promising strategy to derisk SNARK bugs, especially in the long-term, is formal verification. The research team has Alex Hicks dedicated to accelerating zkEVM formal verification. Alex has a budget of $20M for grants and competitions—please get in touch if you are a formal verification expert.. * **real-time proving**: Low-latency SNARK proving (on the order of one slot) required for it to be useful to attesters. My personal belief is that SNARK proving will be fast enough soon, in large part thanks to SNARK ASICs—see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URCH2d1cdyg). Delaying the EVM post-state root by 1 block (i.e. having the post-state be checked in the next block) is a low-hanging EVM performance optimisation which will help with SNARKification too.. * **self-building**: A high gas limit would make validator self-building even more uncompetitive than it is today. Self-building is primarily used for censorship resistance (e.g. with min-bid) which won't be required with inclusion lists. Self-building is also used as a fallback when relays go down which won't be required with APS or ePBS.. * **inclusion lists**: It is important to make sure inclusion lists get populated without validators needing to maintain state. One strategy is to augment transactions with validity proofs (mostly proving the sender can pay gas) that can be immediately verified against the latest state root. Anyone in the world can augment transactions with validity proofs on behalf of users, i.e. it's an honest minority assumption.. * **native rollups**: See [this writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/vrx9xe/ama_we_are_ef_research_pt_8_07_july_2022/if7auu7/) on native rollups, previously called "enshrined rollups".
28
I would say there are two major layer 1 scaling strategies that are being actively considered:..1. Implement proposals that decrease the load of full nodes (such as [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444) (history expiry), [Verkle trees](https://verkle.info/) or hash-based binary trees, and ultimately ZK-SNARKing the EVM), and once these improvements are in place (or soon to be in place), increase the gas limit. The most realistic one for the short term would be EIP-4444, as it requires no consensus changes, just some work on the side to client code that is relatively orthogonal to everything else that is being done on the L1..2. Improve client execution more, and once that is done, increase the gas limit. Here, the key things to improve are: (i) execution, both the VM and precompiles, (ii) state read/write, and (iii) data bandwidth. There are known inefficiencies in all three that can be addressed further..3. Add features to the EVM to accelerate specific forms of computation. One of my favorites is combining [EVM-MAX](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6601-evm-modular-arithmetic-extensions-evmmax/13168) and [SIMD](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/616), which together would give the EVM a numpy-like extension that makes it much faster to do a lot of cryptographic processing. This would make especially cryptography-dependent apps cheaper, particularly heavily benefiting privacy protocols and as a side effect also making it cheaper for L2s to submit to chain more frequently, reducing deposit/withdraw times.
26
It's always been the plan. Polynya has written about it in depth..TLDR: Stateless clients will allow the gas limit to be raised 3-10x and fully SNARKing Ethereum will allow for another 100x or more..[https://polynya.mirror.xyz/epju72rsymfB-JK52\_uYI7HuhJ-W\_zM735NdP7alkAQ](https://polynya.mirror.xyz/epju72rsymfB-JK52_uYI7HuhJ-W_zM735NdP7alkAQ)

We are doing more work around blob pricing, motivated by previous analyses plus the observation that it is an increasingly important resource to price correctly and the market is quite different from other resources (most of the demand comes from "enterprise customers" that are relatively less elastic in the short term, L2s. We have new research on this with some collaborators that will come out in a few weeks.
8
Even at 0 fees, rollups make Ethereum more valuable as a network because it is the natural crossroads of financial activity between the different domains...Generally I believe that blob fees will probably not be the way that Ethereum will capture value from rollups: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/comment/llmfpwd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/comment/llmfpwd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I'm personally currently in favor of pivoting the post-Pectra fork to be about various state-tree-unrelated things, particularly inclusion lists, perhaps [Orbit](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928) (just the shuffling mechanism, without the SSF part) to allow validators with (much) less than 32 ETH to participate, perhaps some EVM improvements or simplifications. That would give us breathing room to skip straight to binary hash trees for the state in the fork after that...We saw Starkware prove > 600k Poseidon hashes per second on a CPU, but Poseidon is controversial due to its novelty. That said, there are newer approaches (eg. GKR) that could give sufficiently high performance even for more "conventional" hashes (eg. maybe BLAKE3). So either much more security analysis of Poseidon, or more mature GKR, or some third option (eg. lattice-based hashes) could all get us there.
15
> With ZK-proof tech advancing really fast, are there any advantages to making the current MPT snark friendly instead?..I agree with the sentiment, and I believe several others do too :) My inclination would be to repurpose the statelessness effort to use a binary Merkle tree instead of a Verkle tree. A lot of the heavy lifting is at the state tree transition point and that Verkle transition work can be reused for a binary Merkle tree...SNARK proving is becoming exceptionally fast. In July a laptop CPU proved [1.2M Posseidon2 hashes per second](https://x.com/weikengchen/status/1808110531053867189)—that opened the Overton window. That benchmark may already be outdated, especially when GPU acceleration comes into the mix. Preliminary numbers presented by Eli Ben-Sasson at SBC suggest that GPU acceleration will provide a 5x speed improvement which opens the possibility to even use a SHA256 binary tree...IMO it's perfectly fine to use GPU acceleration for statelessness for a couple reasons. First of all, statelessness operates under an honest minority assumption meaningful that we just need a minority of entities around the world computing SNARKs for statelessness, and those don't need to be consensus participants. Secondly, the need for GPUs will naturally dissipate over time as CPU SNARK proving continues its seemingly-inexorable exponential speedup.

Ansgar, Yoav and I have been working on a standards forum for L2s to collaborate on features that can exists across L2s. The idea is if a particular L2 would like to ship a feature (eg. multi-dimensional gas pricing), then they can write it up as a [Rollup Improvement Proposal \(RIP\)](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs), they can then get feedback from others L2 teams on what changes would be helpful to make it more useful to the wider industry and then anyone else can ship the same feature and it should be compatable...By providing a neutral platform for standards and discussions, we can hopefully ship things in only one way such that dapps/wallets/users only have to understand one pattern and it just works acorss the L2 ecosystem....Additionally, there has been a recent push by /u/vbuterin and others to establish some standards around wallets and bridging which should help address the aplication layer side of this fragmentation.
11
In ZK, two major short-term practical focuses of relevance for me are:..1. **ZK-proving hundreds of thousands hashes per second**, on a consumer laptop, for an as-conservative-as-possible hash function. If we can do this, then we can go straight to binary hash trees for Ethereum's state tree, skipping Verkle and getting quantum-resistance and an ossified state tree on an accelerated schedule..2. **"Ideal" ZK-EVMs**. To me, "idealness" has two key components: (i) **real-time**, so you can prove a block in < 4 seconds, and (ii) **formally verified**, so there are strong assurances that the proof system only accepts valid EVM executions. This is necessary to enable some of the more ambitious ideas for cross-L2 interoperability, as well as to get the full benefits of ZK-EVMs at L1.
18
Hey! Here are some examples of L1-focused ZK projects at various stages of research maturity:..* Using STARKed hashed binary trees for statelessness.* Using recursive SNARKs for [large-scale recursive signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/signature-merging-for-large-scale-consensus/17386).* Using anon creds via ZK to improve the [robustness of the networking layer](https://ethresear.ch/t/proof-of-validator-a-simple-anonymous-credential-scheme-for-ethereums-dht/16454).* Using STARKs as a way to implement post-quantum aggregatable signatures (instead of BLS).* Using ZK to provide privacy in [single-secret leader election designs](https://ethresear.ch/t/whisk-a-practical-shuffle-based-ssle-protocol-for-ethereum/11763).* Using ZK and zkEVMs for L1 execution (long term!)..Furthermore, the EF cryptography team has a wide interest in ZK research. You can find some of that work on the [cryptography team website](https://crypto.ethereum.org/research).
14
In a recent statement posted on Ethereum Research, the cryptography research team emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) before integrating them into Ethereum. The team currently does not recommend using VDFs in Ethereum, noting that ongoing research and significant improvements are crucial for potentially revising this stance in the future. For more details, see the full statement [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/statement-regarding-the-public-report-on-the-analysis-of-minroot/16670)...Additionally, Mary Maller discussed VDFs in her talk at Devconnect, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoAWnz8ODYk). I also covered related topics at the IC3 Winter Retreat 2024, with the event details available [here](https://www.initc3.org/events/2024-01-08-ic3-winter-retreat-2024).

> What are the areas in zk research EF is currently pursuing, be it theoretical or practical. Where can one find the current/past zk research conducted at EF...I'm extremely excited about SNARKifying the L1 EVM. Massive strides have been made in the last few months. Fresh numbers shared with me today by Uma from Succinct: it now costs roughly $1M/year to prove all L1 EVM blocks, with significant optimisations still in the pipeline. I wouldn't be surprised if this time next year it only costs roughly $100K/year to prove all L1 EVM blocks thanks to [SNARK ASICs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URCH2d1cdyg) and the relentless pace of software optimisations at all levels of the stack (compilers, arithmetisation, proof systems, prover algorithms). Another exciting development is that the EF is accelerating zkEVM formal verification. This is an effort led by Alex Hicks, backed by a budget of $20M...At the beacon chain level, a [recent benchmark](https://x.com/weikengchen/status/1808110531053867189) pushed forward the timeline for hash-based signatures aggregated with SNARKs. SNARK-based aggregation is significantly more flexible than BLS signature aggregation when doing multiple levels of recursive aggregation, and is the key to post-quantum security for the beacon chain...> I know you guys are actively researching on VDFs. Can you provide some information regarding how you (plan to) use them? Which VDFs you use? Have you made any improvements to the current VDFs?..There are two aspects to VDFs: a) building a production-grade VDF as a cryptographic primitive, b) use that primitive in applications...Let me start with b), the applications. The motivating use case for VDFs at Ethereum L1 is to strengthen RANDAO to get unbiasable randomness for leader election. IMO VDFs are the endgame for L1 randomness and remain a "splurge" item in [Vitalik's roadmap diagram](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1741190491578810445/photo/1). So far there is no evidence suggesting that RANDAO is being abused so VDF R&D has definitely been deprioritised relative to when I embarked down the rabbit hole years ago. Other L1 items like inclusion lists, stake capping, SNARKifying the L1 are more important...Besides L1 leader election another great use case for VDFs is lotteries. IMO there is a low-hanging opportunity to build a "world lottery" that is provably fair, world scale, and rake-free. If you want to build this please DM me :) Another fun application of VDFs that came up recently is facilitating the simultaneous release of blocks in the context of multi-proposing. In an unexpected turn of events, Max Resnick became a VDF bull...Now onto a), the primitive itself. This turned out to be much harder than I expected (years of work!) but there is light at the end of the tunnel. We have now MinRoot VDF ASICs that I believe can be used in production for lotteries, not withstanding [this theoretical MinRoot analysis](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04320126/file/minrootanalysis2023.pdf) with no practical attack on 256-bit MinRoot. We now need a team to do the integration work to verify MinRoot SNARK proofs (e.g. Nova or STARK proofs) onchain. This would have been easy with BN254 MinRoot but the Pasta curves require a wrapper SNARKs. DM me if you're interested in doing this integration work :)

EF research is very different from core devs...We are literally just the researchers that happen to work at the Ethereum Foundation. A core dev is someone who contributes to the  clients (and tooling if you like) in some why. It is a vibes-based category of people who build on the core of Ethereum somehow...No-one really gets to decide on who is/isn't a core dev, it's a spectrum and you can choose where you personally draw the line. IMO, a good rough approximation of who is a "core dev" is who attends ACD calls, but this is neither necessary nor sufficient
10
There's plenty of core devs outside of the EF. The most notable examples are members of individual Ethereum client teams (eg. Nethermind, Besu, Nimbus...). There's also plenty of independent researchers, and topic-specific contributors (eg. some Optimism and Base people contributed quite a bit to 4844 deployment).

Over the past year, we (in the Robust Incentives Group (RIG), along with other researchers) have been working on focused the censorship resistance (CR) properties of the Ethereum network by iterating on “Inclusion List” (IL) designs.   .  .In short, ILs allow the decentralised set of validators to force-include transactions in builders’ blocks. This effectively reduces dependence on a small number of sophisticated entities that might otherwise arbitrarily decide which transactions are included in Ethereum blocks (e.g., censor transaction interacting with sanctioned addresses).  .  .We have few [ethresear.ch](http://ethresear.ch) posts on the topic, but I’ll just link our most recent proposal, called Fork-choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL): [https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870). It relies on multiple proposers to co-create an IL including transactions that must be included in the block for it to be considered valid by attesters. If you want to know more or have any other questions feel free to reach out to us!

Researchers at the EF work on various methods to ensure credible neutrality.   .  .Personally, I am very passionate about the inclusion list mechanisms that u/s0isp0ke describes. These inclusion lists allow more people to contribute to block construction so that the preferences of multiple people are represented in a block. These methods ensure credible neutrality as long as the validator set can surface a diverse set of preferences, in other words, if the validator set is decentralized...To ensure the validator set remains decentralized, some researchers work on staking economics. One perspective that particularly appeals to me is *rainbow staking* (https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683). In short, it says that there could be various classes of service providers and that the protocol does not expect all services from all stakers. This could allow the protocol to have one set of light service providers that solely function to surface transactions that others may not have seen or have intentionally excluded. To conclude, staking economics is key to credible neutrality, and rainbow staking may be a promising future direction.

There are two types of censorship:.. 1. **strong censorship**: censored transactions never make it onchain. 2. **weak censorship**: censored transactions go onchain with a (typically small) delay..Strong censorship would come from a 51% attack which has never happened on Ethereum. The strong decentralisation of Ethereum's consensus participants combined with deterrent of 51% attack social recovery IMO makes strong censorship extremely unlikely to ever happen on Ethereum...Weak censorship on the other hands happens routinely because of actors in the MEV pipeline (notably builders, relays, and proposers) filtering transaction touching [OFAC addresses](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/ofac-ethereum-addresses). For censorship metrics see [censorship.pics](https://censorship.pics/). Roughly 15% of Ethereum proposers are censoring by only connecting to censoring relays. Roughly 10% of blocks are built by censoring builders (after [Beaverbuild stopped censoring](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1813871949564772732)). Roughly 50% of blocks are relayed by censoring relays...Relay censorship can be partially addressed with ePBS (see [EIP-7732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732)). Attester-proposer separation (APS, e.g. execution auctions or execution tickets) is an even more extreme solution which simultaneously cuts out proposers and relays from the equation. The plan for builder censorship is inclusion lists, e.g. [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870).

One way this could happen is if several L2s adopt the same zkVM, which could happen reasonably soon as zkVMs are starting to look a bit more stable and production ready..That said, because there are multiple zkVMs (and some L2s may develop their own), I wouldn't expect all L2s to converge to the same circuit.

The EF does not have views on these. Ethereum researchers have their own views, here are mine...> What views does EF have on DeFi?  .I like DeFi, but in isolation it does not solve all of Ethereum's problems...Financial markets do not create value on their own. But they do allow societies to create more value with their different functions, for example by providing liquidity, insurance, etc. This is all amazing...For example, one obviously valuable thing DeFi has done on Ethereum is to provide us with decentralized stablecoins. Personally, my dream was that they would finally allow us to have a "pure" crypto medium of exchange. Sadly, it has become clear that they come with severe scaling limitations, and due to that, people now prefer using custodial alternatives. I still think they are cool and it's great to have them especially for everyone who truly needs a decentralized and censorship-free alternative, but they aren't going to scale to a billion users...Other than that, I think the main thing DeFi lacks most right now is a set of "valuable" assets to operate on. I do actually believe that having this DeFi system ready to pounce is what makes Ethereum poised to be the center of financial activity in the future, but until then, there is still a lot to build...> Why EF does not talk with teams as Maker, Aave, Comp?..I don't know where you get that impression, but I have certainly talked to several of these projects, and I like them. I don't have that many day-to-day interactions, because my work is fundamentally on the infrastructure, and so they are 1-2 layers away from my work, but it's simply not true that we wouldn't talk to them...> What plans do EF have to step closer with users/builders?..What do you suggest?
4
Thanks for the question! I cannot speak for the "EF" since researchers within EF Research have their own opinion on DeFi...Personally, I view DeFi as a fascinating field of applications on Ethereum and as a very valuable use case of Ethereum. In the past year, I have worked on DeFi-related topics, such as a paper on application-layer MEV minimization (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18256). We have regular interactions with various DeFi teams. A good example is ETHconomics, a research day organized by the Robust Incentives Group (RIG), which is a part of EF Research. During ETHconomics 1 of the 3 sessions was on Automated Market Makers and we invited amazing speakers from DeFi teams.

I recently wrote a note comparing the FOCIL and BRAID (https://hackmd.io/xz1UyksETR-pCsazePMAjw), here is the tldr:..* **FOCIL** can be thought of as gadget, or an add-on to the existing Ethereum protocol. It is focused on leveraging multiple validators to improve the network’s censorship resistance properties, but is minimally interfering with the current block market structure..* **BRAID** has a much broader scope, as it aims not only to improve CR but also to 'solve' MEV by trying to prevent any one proposer from having a privileged role or special advantage over others. This involves building a protocol from the ground up, with a new consensus mechanism, as well as significant changes to the execution layer (e.g., ordering rule), and market structure...To me, your question is difficult to answer precisely because of the “if it works” part :-). But I think both approaches have merit, and the nice thing is that they are not mutually exclusive and are being working on in parallel!
8
I'm glad BRAID is being investigated but, as of today, I'm squarely in the FOCIL + APS camp :)..The fundamental issue I see with BRAID is that it introduces "vertical" multi-block games which could be highly centralising. This is the equivalent of multi-slot games that can be played with contiguous slots, but across the "space dimension" instead of the time dimension...Let's say we're doing BRAID with n=4 concurrent proposers. If a large operator controls k>1 proposers then proposer fairness breaks down:.. * **k=2**: There's a so-called "risky last look" attack vector. The basic idea is for one of the proposers to act conservatively and proposes a fat block on time to collect inclusion fees. The other proposer proposes a thin block right at the attestation boundary with a bunch of "last look" MEV from the timing game.. * **k=4**: This is where things really go astray. One entity has exceptionally won full control of the slot and can maximally extract all the MEV. This could be highly centralising because large operators (e.g. Coinbase or Kiln) will occasionally hit the MEV jackpot when the stars align whereas small operators will only have access to MEV dust.. * **k=3**: Things get dicey here too. For example there's an incentive for the large operator to DoS the 4th proposer they don't control, essentially falling back to the k=4 jackpot scenario. There's also an incentive for the large operator to collude with the 4th proposer, again because of the MEV jackpot.
6
Both Mechan-stein (APS + FOCIL + ePBS) (https://ethresear.ch/t/mechan-stein-alt-franken-ism/20321) and BRAID are very exciting directions. However, FOCIL + ePBS is in a very different research and development stage than BRAID (https://twitter.com/soispoke/status/1828744092622184655). The former is well-understood; there is a detailed description of FOCIL and an EIP for ePBS. The latter is an exciting new idea that would still need a lot of research. I think Mechan-stein and BRAID do not have to be framed as competing with each other but rather as explorations into block co-creation.   .  .So, in short, I am personally very excited about both, and I will be working on ideas related to both directions.

Answered a bit [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1f81ntr/comment/llmg4n9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) too, if I had to pick one of the four, I'm personally quite excited by FOCIL specifically because it introduces ideas that are "net new" (to the protocol, which doesn't have such a gadget today) and seem to be clearly going in the right direction...But that excitement is inclusive, not exclusive :) I could see the other mechanisms/protocols in your question playing an important role in the near or longer term.

IMO having a smarter issuance curve which goes to zero around a soft cap (e.g. at 1/4, 1/3 or 1/2 of all ETH staked) is a no-brainer. The main bottleneck is social coordination. We need a savvy and motivated person to champion an EIP all the way to mainnet. What do you say, pintail? 😊 This is a super high-impact mission and I expect the community to cheer along.
19
Thanks for these questions! I will answer them in three separate comments...**CONCERNING EXCESSIVE ISSUANCE**..There have been several proposals this year in line with this. There have been research posts on a reward curve that [tempers issuance](https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171) (see also [1](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-55-potential-candidate-for-a-new-reward-curve-23), [2](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825), [3](https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/subsol#3-Scaled-Root-Curve-alternative-issuance)), a research post on [economic capping](https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751) (targeting), and posts on [capped issuance ](https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Reward-curve-with-capped-issuance)and [MVI](https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI). The FAQ also [goes through](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#what-is-the-endgame-issuance-policy-28) all these different options, as well as several others. ..What is needed at this point is to build a movement among Ethereum’s users in favor of fixing Ethereum’s excessive issuance as well as a nuanced discussion concerning the extent to which we should reduce issuance. Due to the sensitive nature of changing issuance policy, it would make it easier if we can build some movement before proceeding further. But I would be happy to push forward on this if there is a movement for it.
12
A controller is feasible but it's too complicated imo. Since we have the ability of expressing the demand curve and no need to target a specific ratio number but rather a range we should go with that option instead...I initially discussed both options in my CEE 2023 talk (and the second option has been researched a lot since):  .[https://davidecrapis.notion.site/Ethereum-Staking-State-of-the-Union-df1e470bbfe14d7fa02e5dae5eb1211f](https://davidecrapis.notion.site/Ethereum-Staking-State-of-the-Union-df1e470bbfe14d7fa02e5dae5eb1211f)

I wrote about [Rainbow staking](https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683), trying to argue for unbundling certain "staker roles" so that solo stakers can be effective participants on the network. It's still a very broad vision, but I feel directionally right. One of the first steps would be to think more about [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870) as a CR mechanism and get more experience with it, to assess whether it is indeed a good "light service" for e.g., a separate class of light operators (which solo stakers could become/take on additionally).
6
> EIP 7251 will be included in the next hardfork..(Not an EF researcher but) Yes this will be included, but this EIP isn't primarily or even secondarily designed to benefit solo stakers. As a solo staker, it's *really, really* nice that we'll be able to compound rewards, but I don't see this having a major impact on the viability of solo staking or the structural disenfranchisement that we're feeling in comparison to those operators with the economies of scale...Decreasing the minimum staking balance won't happen until we reduce the size of the validator set significantly (I guess that's why you asked both of these questions) but I'm not certain that maxEB will make a significant dent in that, especially because it's unclear whether or not large operators will have sufficient incentives to adopt maxEB. Something like [OrbitSSF](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928) may address these concerns, but that's definitely not going into Pectra as it's still in the idea phase.

Rollups will charge their users more for their transactions if blob fees increase. This will naturally lead to having fewer transactions on L2s, the same as it currently happens on Ethereum L1.
6
There are ways in which the current mechanism can be improved (see other questions that mention "blobs"). However, the scenario you are suggesting is not a concern: remember that the L1 data cost is passed on to L2 users as a component of L2 fees, thus, when the data cost increases due to congestion the demand for L2 transactions will be reduced which is downward pressure on the demand for blobs and blobs price...Section 3 in Arbitrum Nitro whitepaper is also a good resource to understand structure of L2 fees: [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/Nitro-whitepaper.pdf](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/Nitro-whitepaper.pdf)

It's been discussed quite a bit but the idea of "bulk blobspace" (mentioned it in the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kh7b5pk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) too) would make sense to me, rollups are repeat customers with predictable (if sometimes volatile) loads, there may be a point in offering more structured products for them at protocol-level. It's unclear whether it's the most important thing to focus on atm though vs more scale.

The whole p2p networking side of things is not just understaffed but under-talked-about imo.

In my view, core Ethereum development could use more people. Some topics, like MEV, naturally attract attention, but others, like the fork-choice, do not. This latter area, the fork-choice, could definitely use more eyes. If you are interested in working on other areas, there is also room to do so. Consider checking out the RIG Open Problems (https://efdn.notion.site/RIG-Open-Problems-ROPs-c11382c213f949a4b89927ef4e962adf)! We are also happy to work with people that have their own research proposal!

I'd lean understaffed! Feel free to DM me if you may be interested in helping with Ethereum research :)

To add to this, It is now apparent that the minimum blob base fee was mis-priced too low at 1 wei. L2s are deliberately using various strategies to minimize blob fee with many people identifying this as parasitic to the long-term health of Ethereum especially as blob fees have an insignificant effect on L2 profits. Max Resnick proposed to increase the minimum blob base fee from 1 wei to 160217286 wei at the last ACDC for the upcoming Pectra update but it currently does not have an EIP.  Will an EIP be developed and included in Pectra to increase the blob base fee?  ..To help make ETH deflationary again and ensure an economically viable Ethereum, devs could modify blob base fee and blob number per block via soft forks rather than wait for a hard fork as the changes are simply changing numbers. Should blob fee and blob number per block be adjusted on a more regular basis via soft forks to reflect changing demand for blobs/calldata to ensure a viable competitive fee market for blobs and L1 txs?..To create a competitive blob fee market there are 3 options; 1) increase/decrease the blob base fee, 2) increase/decrease the blob number per block or 3) add junk data to partially fill blob space. Would the EF consider doing option 3) as this could be done in realtime? 
5
> What are your thoughts of Max resnicks criticism of the increasingly parasitic relationship the L2s are having with Ethereum L1? Why are L2s not decentralizing quicker and how do we incentivize them to move faster?..I'm 30 minutes through [Max's recent Bankless episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLUJ0uLye0U) and I believe he got the wrong end of the stick. I've discussed it with him privately so this write-up shouldn't come as a surprise. His core premise, which he re-emphasises several times, is that L2s are disincentivised to decentralise because they would lose sequencer fees. He has also shared this view on Twitter, e.g. [here](https://x.com/MaxResnick1/status/1828956685765062841) and [here](https://x.com/MaxResnick1/status/1829127389437128843). On the podcast and on Twitter he specifically calls out Coinbase that makes $200M in annual fees with Base. Counter-intuitively, L2s are incentivised to decentralise sequencing to maximise fees—it's the opposite of Max's claim :)..The term "sequencer fees" is truly unfortunate because it is misleading. Base makes 100% of its revenue from execution congestion fees. The Base fees are determined by an EIP-1559-style gas mechanism which mimics the L1 (see documentation [here](https://docs.base.org/docs/fees/)). The big difference is that Base fees are sent to a Coinbase wallet instead of getting burned like on the L1...Coinbase makes so much money because gas demand on Base is greater than the gas target. It's a VM throughput issue and congestion fees have essentially nothing to do with sequencing. If Base used a decentralised sequencer Coinbase would still be making those congestion fees. For example, if Base used L1 validators for sequencing and became a "based rollup" Coinbase would still be collecting execution congestion fees. Congestion fees originate from the Base VM gas target. The sequencer merely informs users about L2 congestion fees—the sequencer plays a superficial role. Value creation originates from the Base VM gas target and the blockspace supply-demand mismatch...IMO the only valid use of the term "sequencer fees" is for MEV where value capture does specifically originate from sequencing, i.e. the strategic positioning of frontrunning and backrunning transactions. Base's sequencing is first-come-first-served with a private mempool where users send their transactions end-to-end encrypted to the Base sequencer. There is no MEV captured by Coinbase—no sequencer fees!—and I don't know of L2s that captures MEV today. Base capturing MEV would be at the expense of their users, e.g. swappers would get sandwiched or DEX LPs would get more exposure to adverse flow which ultimately leads to worse prices for swappers. L2s naturally don't want to degrade execution quality for users so MEV extraction is not happening on L2s...The story continues! It turns out sequencer fees are bad for cross-L2 composability besides being bad for intra-L2 execution quality. Indeed, to extract MEV one needs some sort of proprietary sequencing infrastructure and shared sequencing is ruled out across two proprietary sequencers. Without shared sequencing the gold standard of composability called "synchronous composability" is lost. See [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd7phVLbIug&list=PLbig0e-vh2_NJFaz52OvMI2sVAH-Ys3cg&index=13) titled "Why is synchrony valuable?". The erosion of composability reduces opportunities for cross-L2 transactions (e.g. from 1inch-style DEX aggregators) which ultimately reduces congestion fees. In order to maximise fees an L2 should maximise congestion fees which means maximising composability...To maximise composability we need shared sequencing. As a community, how do we coordinate on a canonical Ethereum-wide shared sequencer? Two competing L2s—say Arbitrum and Base—are only going to agree to opt into a shared sequencer that is credibly neutral. IMO only decentralised and permissionless sequencers can achieve sufficient credible neutrality. And as some of you may know, I have an even stronger thesis: IMO the only credible Ethereum-wide sequencer is Ethereum itself which does not introduce a new brand, a new token, or a new security assumption...> Why are L2s not decentralizing quicker and how do we incentivize them to move faster?..Decentralising the sequencers is hard and will take time. L2s currently use centralised sequencers as a training wheel for three different things:.. 1. **security**: Centralised sequencers prevent attackers from permissionlessly exploiting fraud proof or SNARK bugs even if those exist on mainnet. Decentralising the sequencers means having multi-proofs, formal verification, or some other security training wheel like TEEs.. 2. **MEV**: Centralised sequencers provide a quick-and-dirty encrypted mempool to prevent MEV extraction. Decentralising the sequencers means having fancy encrypted mempools like SUAVE or some other suitable MEV pipeline.. 3. **preconfs**: Centralised sequencers provide fast UX. Decentralising the sequencers means having low-latency consensus or using cryptoeconomic preconfirmations which are [under active R&D](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHDFarAcF29QfdMlUpReZrR).

Disclaimer: The EF has roughly 300 people spread across dozens of teams. I certainly can't talk to an EF-wide view, let alone to a view held by the EF research team which comprises 38 people...I think for several years my personal opinion has been clear: the ETH token is of utmost importance for the success of Ethereum. I'll plug [this recent Verified podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrFgjOc_Gkw) where I candidly talk about ETH. ETH being valuable—outrageously valuable—has positive reflexive consequences:.. * **economic bandwidth**: We need trillions of dollars of decentralised stablecoins to be collateralised by the only pristine collateral on Ethereum, ETH. IMO it's critical to find a way out from centralised stablecoins like USDT and USDC for defi and Ethereum to truly shine.. * **economic security**: Having trillions of dollars of economic security through staking will provide a credible story for attacks from the world's most powerful actors. (IMO Bitcoin's economic security, on the order of $10B, is clearly insufficient to resist motivated nation state actors.). * **economic salience**: BTC enjoys permanence as the #1 crypto asset in large part because of the attention it garners being the #1 crypto asset by marketcap—it's reflexive! Michael Saylor is right: there is no second-best #1-by-marketcap. IMO Ethereum and ETH will be unstoppable forces if and when ETH flips BTC because of tailwinds from economic salience.

[EIP-7706](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7706) from /u/vbuterin provides a transaction format with a "vector" of resources and their own max fees and max priority fees. This could also unify the update rules of the different mechanisms.

One important thing we need to push on in the short to medium term is getting light clients working as a standard part of consumer wallets. [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) is continuing to improve, and is getting close to ready for this. Another important piece is extending the light client security guarantees to L2s. This is starting to become more practical and more standardized, and is actually a much easier problem than making a light client for L1, because you already have the L1 state as a constantly-updating root of trust.

Both (1) and (2) are achieved through scaling, which facilitates sustainable economic activity. This involves millions upon millions of users paying low transaction fees, with transactions secured by Ethereum. That is a sustainable way to increase aggregate fees. Barnabé explained this from the user perspective rather eloquently in the second paragraph of his [AMA answer ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/comment/hrmuz8l/)three years ago...When it comes to the situation *before* and *after* EIP 4844, I’d add that it cannot readily be reduced to the change itself. Layer 2s developed on Ethereum and paid high fees to settle on Ethereum due to the existence of a roadmap that would lead to a fall in fees down the road. Had the roadmap not been in place, these L2s may have never been developed. Likewise, had the roadmap not started to be executed on, they may have eventually left for someplace else. The gas price at one point in time is a reflection of everything that came before and everything that will come in the future. What this suggests is that abandoning scaling would not necessarily make Ethereum net deflationary in the long run, because transaction demand was partly driven by future scaling promises...Another thing worth mentioning is that perpetual net deflation requires more than an issuance reduction or an increase in fee burn. The long-run staking equilibrium under reward curves that adapt to the amount that is staked (deposit size *D*) instead of the proportion that is staked (deposit ratio *d*) is ultimately also influenced by the [circulating supply equilibrium](https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954), as the circulating supply will [drift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtEMabS0Oas&t=1187s) to [balance](https://twitter.com/weboftrees/status/1710725744651825281) supply, demand, and protocol income. ..To achieve perpetual deflation, the issuance policy must be [changed](https://x.com/weboftrees/status/1710728179260731715) by swapping out D for d in the equation for the reward curve, and normalizing by including the circulating supply at the time of the swap, once the circulating supply [begins to be tracked](https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751#how-to-set-the-target-in-relative-staking-ratio-instead-of-absolute-fixed-eth-amount-terms-20) at the consensus layer.

Lido dominance has gone down from roughly 33% to [28.38%](https://x.com/lidodominance/status/1831693774801522924). The narrative that LST network effects would be so strong that a single LST would crush all other forms of staking hasn't played out, at least so far...One massive development for solo staking is [Orbit](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928) which would lower staking requirements from 32 ETH to 1 ETH. A sizeable portion of stakers use an LST because they don't have the 32 ETH to become a solo staker. Attester-proposer separation (APS) will also significantly simplify solo staking—see [this "zen staking" slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14XX4GOmEUGbo5D5yjjDfoVCKZIrzA9MJjsDv3ItanF4/edit#slide=id.g2ea88df826d_0_505).

1. More options for layer 2s to be secure, due to greater rollup DA space (Bitcoin only has 4 MB / 600s = 6667 bytes per sec and that's assuming _all_ on-chain data gets used for DA; compare 32 kB/sec EIP-4844 status quo and 1.3 MB/sec long-run goal).2. Proof of stake, which is proving its ability to remain decentralized month by month, and offers far more options for 51% recovery.3. Demonstrated highly effective social layer, eg. [censorship scares](https://x.com/ercwl/status/1828154692469141851), [client centralization scares](https://clientdiversity.org/), staking pool market share centralization scares, and many other things, have all been addressed by coordinated ecosystem-wide action.4.

When it comes to trustless one-shot signatures at this point it's mainly quantum and crypto nerds thinking about very futuristic ideas in the abstract. I gave a [talk on one-shot signatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmqkH3NPG_s) last year. Earlier this year Aggelos Kiayias (one of the one-shot signature paper authors) and I organised QSig—recordings are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw7VZzZP3we4uDnHZ4SH3DbvmGkAYiXYh). Due a recording issue my opening talk was not recorded but slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wgCus2lwlnW3Ol5aBkHuPbOtXd6Mg16OS_GmZvkY-ck/edit#slide=id.g261a7b5180c_1_112). I believe the EF gave a small grant to Stefano Gogioso and Fabrizio Romano Genovese to push the R&D around one-shot signatures, and quantum cryptography academics are increasingly looking at them. Just a few days ago Alex Obadia and Nicola Greco released quantumpunks.org in tweets [here](https://x.com/ObadiaAlex/status/1831320165310517681) and [here](https://x.com/iamnotnicola/status/1831376645766205533)...If you're willing to accept TEEs then one-shot signatures become trivial. Andrew Miller and others are excited about TTE one-shot signatures (see [here](https://x.com/socrates1024/status/1807132103588667651), [here](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/request-for-suapp-one-shot-signature/3332/2), [here](https://github.com/flashbots/andromeda-sirrah-contracts/compare/main...amiller:andromeda-sirrah-contracts:oneshotsig), [here](https://github.com/flashbots/andromeda-sirrah-contracts/pull/53/)).

Great question :) A handful of people (many of which EFers!) have had questions about the ultra sound relay. Here is some transparency:.. * **launch**: The ultra sound relay [launched in November 2022](https://x.com/ultrasoundmoney/status/1597939734088908800) at a time of extremely high relay censorship—roughly 80% of mev-boost blocks went through censoring relays.. * **mission**: The raison d'être of the ultra sound relay is to reduce relay censorship. Significant progress has been made but censorship remains high with the bloXroute and Flashbots relays both censoring. (See relay dominance on [relayscan.io](https://www.relayscan.io/).). * **EFers**: The only EF person involved with the ultra sound relay is myself. No one else at the EF has ever been part of the ultra sound team. Prior to joining the EF, Mike Neuder led the implementation of optimistic relaying in the Flashbots reference relay implementation (see PR [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/380)). Various researchers, mostly Toni Wahrstätter and Thomas Thiery, were temporarily given data from the ultra sound relay for data analysis.. * **team**: The ultra sound team is comprised of 3 core team members working full time (Alex Tesfamichael, Niclas Blomberg, Christian Koopmann) plus me involved part time. For a period of time I employed a Ukrainian refugee called Yulia to help part time with the ultra sound money Twitter account.. * **domains**: Ownership of the domain names ultrasound.money and ultrasound.eth, which I acquired in January 2021, has been transferred to the core team.. * **keys**: The [ultra sound treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x52F8592BaAf3B90bC94Cb52F06C086080858e4d7) held at ultrasound.eth and the [optimistic relaying collateral](https://etherscan.io/address/0x27a8318036e3639c4F92C919C5304948e8C135EE) held at relay.ultrasound.eth are both controlled by the core team. I don't otherwise control private keys or multisig shares for the ultra sound project.. * **groups**: No EFer other than me is part of ultra sound Telegram or Discord groups, with the exception of one "ultra sound relay <> EF" Telegram group.. * **governance**: The first person to join the ultra sound project full time was Alex Tesfamichael in August 2021. Back then there were three governance votes: one for me, one for Alex, and one for David Hoffman who accepted to be a tie breaker in case of dispute. The core team now controls the majority of governance votes without the need for a tie breaker.. * **donations**: For most of its existence the ultra sound relay was funded by generous one-off donations. The main donations, spread across two years, have been 100 ETH from an individual who wishes to remain anonymous, [100 ETH from Nouns DAO](https://nounsagora.com/proposals/304), and [100K OP from Optimism RPGF3](https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3). The EF has never provided funding for the ultra sound relay.. * **payouts**: Every core team member receives relatively modest monthly compensation—a few thousand dollars per month. I don't receive monthly compensation and have never otherwise extracted money from the project. Instead, I provided roughly $100K of personal capital to build and maintain the ultrasound.money dashboard in 2021 and 2022.. * **burn rate**: Nowadays the ultra sound relay spends hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on cloud bills and devops manpower. One-off donations have been an essential lifeline but are clearly unsustainable.. * **sustainability**: Earlier this year the ultra sound relay experimented with so-called "bid adjustments" to try to achieve financial sustainability. The basic idea is to replicate the business model of searchers and builders: bid just enough to win the auction but otherwise capture the edge relative to the next highest bidder. As of today adjustments provide roughly enough income for the ultra sound project to cover expenses and break even.. * **future plans**: The core ultra sound team will likely spend the rest of 2024 dedicated to improving and maintaining the relay. The relay technology and know-how may prove useful when L2s decentralise their sequencers. As a researcher I plan to continue exploring attester-proposer separation (APS) designs like execution auctions (EAs) so that Ethereum validators no longer need relays.. * **preconfs**: I am also excited by the potential for preconfirmations to improve Ethereum UX and composability. It's early days and there is cautious scepticism about preconfirmations from the core ultra sound team. Having said that, the team will likely experiment operating a preconf gateway in 2025.

In my view, ensuring credible neutrality is one of the most important aspects of Ethereum. I view credible neutrality, or ensuring that any pending, fee-paying transaction ought to be included if it is available and if there is room to include it on-chain, as a more holistic view of censorship resistance as it contains transactions that fell through the cracks for other reasons than targeted censorship...I, and many others at EF Research, spend a large amount of time to ensure credible neutrality. We do this by contributing to gadgets that allow transactions to be included by multiple proposers (FOCIL: https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870) and by ensuring a decentralized validator set via staking economic related topics.

It sucks that you lost so much, I'm sorry to hear it happened!..Due to the permissionless nature of the chain, there is nothing that anyone can really do about that aspect. Law-enforcement has as much access and control over the chain as we do, none...That said, there has been a lot of growth from the on & off-ramps in terms of freezing assets when someone tries to move them off chain. There are also several services that collaborate on lists of scams, fraud, and phishing that are connected to wallets, bridges, exchanges, block-explorers etc and they've done a lot of fantastic work at warning/blocking dangerous accounts & contracts.
2
Layer 1 research is going strong imo, and not just about scaling!..- Credible paths to single-slot finality with e.g., [Orbit SSF](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928).- Credible paths to improved censorship-resistance with [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870).- Credible paths to scaling DA with [PeerDAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOdpO1tH_Us)..and many more discussions on staking economics, statelessness, cryptographic improvements...

The problem with putting this on L1 mainnet is that client teams are focused on other scaling issues. Essentially the users of L1 that we should be optimising for are the L2s. The L2s are then the ones who should ship enshrined AA. Hence why this is a RIP, not an EIP...The team behind RIP-7560 have are chatting with many of the L2s to try ensure that it is in a form that works for everyone. After that point we can ship.

Here are more details about current EF research sub-teams :).. * **consensus R&D**: 17 members, managed by Hsiao-Wei Wang. * **robust incentives group (RIG)**: 7 members, managed by Barnabé Monnot. * **cryptography**: 4 members, managed by Mary Maller. * **protocol security**: 5 members, managed by Fredrik Svantes. * **applied research group (ARG)**: 5 members, managed by Alex Stokes..I'm part of "consensus R&D" which has a bunch of protocol generalists like Vitalik, Dankrad, Danny.

Minimum viable issuance is very much alive and doing quite well I would say. The low current fee burn puts the spotlight on issuance, making it clear that we are indeed incurring high costs under the current issuance regime, costs that could be reduced to make Ethereum better. But minimum viable issuance is valuable in its own right and is not specifically a tool to make Ethereum “ultrasound”. What minimum viable issuance achieves are [two key things](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#why-should-ethereum-reduce-its-issuance-4):..1. Reducing issuance lowers the costs (hardware, risks and opportunity costs, loss of liquidity, taxes, etc.) that Ethereum’s users are compelled to bear, thus improving overall welfare (see also [this blog post](https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/Foundations-of-MVI)). .2. If everyone stakes, some LSTs may become “too big to fail”, and the social layer may struggle to uphold the intended consensus process. Proliferation of LSTs can also impede ETH as trustless money, making Ethereum less appealing to rely and build on due to the risk of future monopolistic pressure...For these reasons, MVI is desirable both under 2% deflation and 2% inflation.

Formal verification and verifiable computing are tied to a common goal: we'd like to trust the code that everyone in the network is running. This is at the core of why we'd like to use blockchains..Verifiable computing allows us to get cryptographic proofs of program execution and with zkVMs we could do this for any program that you can compile to the underlying ISA (e.g., RISC-V)..This is where formal verification comes into play. First, zkVMs are complicated, so you need to make sure that there aren't any issues in their implementation. Second, if you're running a particularly important program -- let's say you running the EVM, so you have a zkEVM -- you also want to make sure that this EVM is a correct implementation of the EVM. I'm leading a project to address this (verified-zkevm.org) so you can follow that (and/or participate!) if you're interested..I'd also like to emphasize that formal verification here isn't just about checking the correctness of what we already have, it's also about allowing us to optimize things even further and get better performance from code that might otherwise be too hard to audit, while still having the right guarantees...With respect to interoperability and bringing in non solidity developers to the ecosystem, I think that both can help..Verifiable computation removes the need to re-execute computations, so if you have a snark proving the execution of a program on some VM, you can verify this on another VM (that maybe has a different ISA or w/e). That helps interoperability and can give more flexibility to developers..Formal verification doesn't help in as direct a way, but down the road I think it will enable some interesting things. If we get to the point where program verification is cheap; for example, with automation, whether that's with solvers or AI, then it will be easier to produce code that can be checked for correctness and safely deployed, to translate code from any language to solidity with guarantees that the semantics of the program are preserved, or to prompt an LLM to generate a contract with an accompanied by proof that your contract implements a desired spec.

We now have one based rollup on mainnet—Taiko. [This slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YckjQ1LEGs9E8lhSO3-qFvpdLAefEAzgx5018CL7O-M/edit#slide=id.g2e3075303b5_0_204) shows a number of L2s (Gwyneth, IntMax, Keyspace, Puffer, RISE) planning to also launch based rollups. There's now also a bulging industry of preconf projects with Bolt, Espresso, Interstate, Luban, Monea, Primev, Spire and XGA. Steady R&D progress is happening behind the scenes...We've had [14 sequencing calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHDFarAcF29QfdMlUpReZrR) plus three in-person sequencing days in London, Berlin, Brussels. In June we had [a preconf devnet](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1801321889152835758) and in July [testnet Helder launched](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1812013179678990743). In August Bolt made an [alpha release of L1 inclusion preconfs](https://x.com/boltprotocol_/status/1825931829729193988). The [Commit-Boost](https://x.com/Commit_Boost) neutral sidecar for proposer commitments will be security audited soon for use on mainnet...Next up is sequencing week Nov 4-8 at [Edge City in Chiang Mai](https://edge-city.webflow.io/lanna), plus a fourth [sequencing day in Bangkok](https://lu.ma/auh8nd9x) during Devcon. Optimistically, we may get execution preconfs on Taiko this year. There's also solid progress on complementary infrastructure like real-time provers (both TEE-based and SNARK-based) and cross-L2 safety with AggLayer. I expect the fruit of our work to start bearing in 2025 and I'm hopeful interest in based sequencing will crescendo. Looking longer term, there's now also impetus to reduce L1 slot times which benefits based sequencing.

I'll turn this around and ask you what you think the narrative should be?..The EF doesn't have opinions on this nor does it "choose a path". The EF is a loose collection of people who all have their own opinions on what they would like to see Ethereum become. Personally, I think there are many cool components of DeFi and lots of cool things being done, but there is also a lot of cyclic value being passed around. I think DeFi will remain a core part of what happens on Ethereum, but I also hope to see much more happening. Ultimately, it is up to the community/market in terms of what the chain is used for.
3
I have a vastly easier time making payments with crypto than I do with traditional finance. My credit cards stop working regularly. International wires take days to pass through. Sending ETH or stablecoin to an address is incredibly easy and finishes in seconds.
7
It's the negative externalities of big blocks that are bad, not the big blocks themselves. L1 big blocks are fine if:.. * consensus participants (as attesters) are not burdened by them—this can be achieved with SNARKs and data availability sampling (DAS). * consensus participants (as proposers) can still force transaction onchain—this can be achieved with inclusion lists..Ethereum L1 will eventually have gigantic blocks yet attesters will be able to run on watches and proposers will populate inclusion lists. Solana's vision is that consensus participants run on server-grade infra.
4
> why is EF so opaque?..The EF research team tries to be transparent, running AMAs like those roughly twice a year since 2019. What do you want to know?..> who runs EF?..EF leadership consists of Aya Miyaguchi, Josh Stark, Danny Ryan, Bastian Aue, Vitalik Buterin.

One more thing that I would add is, to me it feels like fee collection and sequencer decentralization are orthogonal. If the sequencer is centralized, then you sequence and you collect the fees+MEV (but spend effort figuring out how to get the MEV). If the sequencer is decentralized, then you are gaining the revenue from auctioning off the sequencer slot, which in equilibrium equals fees+MEV minus the cost of figuring out how to get the MEV. The situations seem symmetrical...The main asymmetry I see is _maybe_ a social one: that while the sequencer is centralized, it's easier to get away with collecting fees+MEV instead of giving them to your token holders (or whatever distribution was publicly agreed with your community), but being decentralized requires "doing the right thing" economically speaking. But I hope that L2s don't actually keep centralized for _this_ reason, and I hope that the community (incl orgs like L2beat) take this into account and watch out for such situations.

Fantastic idea. Throughout history, lotteries have proven to be an excellent source for building things, like the Great Wall of China. And today, a very popular form of entertainment and fund raising.
7
First of all I love you Justin you are my ETH Jezus, and secondly does that not alright exist namely 'pooltogether'? Also, from an ethical standpoint there could be some better unbuilt usecases that have better societal benefits like decentralised government voting systems.

We are building this on Ethereum at megapot dot io! ..We are crypto's largest lottery already - $70k daily jackpot, with $2M in lotteries run. It is fair, global, and all the rake goes back to the community. ..It works because liquidity providers fund the initial jackpot like how they create a position on Uniswap. When players buy tickets, they pay fees to LPs, and these fees accrue to the position and grow the jackpot...It's also a permissionless protocol so we have a vibrant app ecosystem. 9 apps are building on us since we provide a lottery-as-a-service. ..If you're open to it, would love to chat more.
2
Can [https://pooltogether.com/](https://pooltogether.com/) do that?
1
I think you're confusing content with accessible messaging. Ethereum suffers from a massive 'geek' issue, where the club loves talking about the infrastructure, more than the benefits of what the platform could do for the world in the long run. This is a mistake IMHO. ..At the very least there should be a small team with a remit to identify, promote and above all deliver a vision which can resonate with the world. No-one out there is interested in your layer2 or blogs problems, who cares? But if you tell the average person that Ethereum is being deployed to help solve 'X' global problem, you'll have something which will transform the value and acceptance of the technology...The right message is everything. (in my very inferior opinion of course). :)
2
This is explained so beautifully.  And exactly why I have a problem with play to earn games when there is no value accrual
1
Thanks for the answer...BTC built an excellent monetary premium without really caring about flows or trustless collateral - just by everyone focusing on one core meme. ..I'm curious why don't we just tackle this head on, without having to rely on the trinkets and infra, which goes way over the head of 95% of users in any case. ..What would your response be to a proposal similar to that [proposed by DCInvestor on Twitter](https://x.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1829121472717083107), for a top down approach from EF (of course heavily supported by the community), to push for ETH as censorship resistant, debasement resistant money as the sole raison d'etre of the network, analogous to BTC (with the difference being we don't kill the planet + have a native L2 ecosystem already)?..Simple meme: the Ethereum network exists so ETH can be censorship resistant, debasement resistant money. The rest of the roadmap and infra still happens on the side - but when one asks what's the value accrual thesis for ETH the asset - we have one simple core meme. ..Is there any possibility of the EF explicitly defining ETH the asset as such?

That makes sense, thanks!

At some point in the future this will run out (definitely a healthy balance nonetheless). Is there a plan to sustainability, or is the end game intended without the EF?

Assuming as you say, that heavy EVM execution would happen outside of consensus by specialised nodes operated by larger entities. Is the thinking that market forces would prevent these entities from withholding proofs and halting the chain? i.e. there would be no real economic incentive to attack the chain (only lost earnings) and there would be enough independent actors that it would probably be impossible to collude and do this in the first place?
3
What is the role of general purpose EVM rollups in this long-term roadmap? Isn't the goal of a limitless L1 essentially saying that Ethereum intends to pursue an Amazon style strategy of eating it's own distributors?
2
how can one get in touch with Alex regarding the grant opportunities ?

Thanks, looking forward to reading it in ethresear.ch!

My understanding is that some teams are already silently working on verkle in the background. Has the EF research team talked with the core devs regarding this possible pivot?

How far off from lottery like that is [https://pooltogether.com/](https://pooltogether.com/) ?

That was my impression as well. Thanks for confirming.

That was my impression as well. Thanks for clarifying !

Yeah I guess that’s really my question. How do we envision getting them to adopt the same zkVM…hmm. Thank you for reply.

Isn't the k == n case how it works currently? A single entity has full control and can extract all MEV when they are a proposer for a slot

**CONCERNING A PID CONTROLLER**..This question has been [answered in the FAQ](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#why-not-dynamically-adjust-the-yield-with-a-mechanism-like-eip-1559-to-guarantee-some-fixed-target-participation-level-16). A PID controller targeting some specific quantity (or proportion) of stake can, in the long run, be understood as a vertical reward curve positioned at the target. It is illustrated by magenta lines in Figures 5-7 of the FAQ. The controller would of course adapt the yield gradually to avoid too big changes from small shifts in the supply curve, but the equilibrium would ultimately return to a point where the supply curve intersects the vertical reward curve...This sort of “reward curve” comes with a few drawbacks, under scenarios marked by red crosses in Figures 5-7 of the FAQ:..**1. Too low yield**..In an attempt to temper the quantity of stake to some ideal level, say 30M ETH, the controller may eventually set the yield “too low”. Delegating stakers may be willing to supply stake at such a low yield that solo stakers are pushed out, due to their higher fixed costs...It turns out that the controller may actually end up trying to set the issuance yield negative (taking out a fee from stakers every epoch). The reason is that stakers also receive MEV, which may be more than sufficient if the staking target is low (20-30M). This brings two additional downsides:..* As issuance yield falls to zero and there are no rewards incentivizing stakers to fulfill their attestation duties, [consensus formation may break down](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-3-consensus-incentives-11). .* Furthermore, relative variability in rewards [will rise](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448#h-4-variability-in-rewards-for-solo-stakers-12) when spurious MEV rewards to proposers are all that remain. Indeed, under negative issuance yield, non-pooled stakers (e.g., most solo stakers) must lose money each epoch in the hope of eventually being assigned to propose a block...The best way to rectify the issues of the two bullet points is to pursue MEV burn or some other solution stopping proposers from extracting MEV. But such solutions are only at a research stage at the moment. And in either case, the concern pertaining to solo staking would not be addressed anyway. ..**2. Too high issuance**..The opposite scenario is also possible. The vertical “reward curve” has no limits on how low or how high issuance can become. If the target is set a bit higher, perhaps to alleviate the previously outlined concerns, we may end up issuing far more tokens than what would be necessary for ensuring security. The downside of course is the unnecessary costs that Ethereum then subjects its users to. For the users, this manifests as being coerced into taking on some of those costs as a staker, or otherwise see their savings eroded by dilution...What this discussion illustrates, together with the figures in the FAQ, is that a PID controller targeting a fixed quantity of stake will fail to capture the diminishing marginal utility of stake in Ethereum. A traditional reward curve allows Ethereum to attach a price on security that reflects its derived utility. There is not one specific deposit size that is ideal under any supply curve. The desired reward curve is the “[expansion path](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#philosophical-underpinnings-of-the-optimization-problem-30)” that optimizes all known trade-offs of low/high yield and stake participation (long/short-run economic security, aggregate costs, staking set composition, variability, trustless money, etc.) across potential supply curves.
10
You are correct, I totally forgot about that part of the equation. Thanks for the answer!

I don't quite understand this take. When fees are high, people complain that Ethereum doesn't scale enough. When fees are super low, people complain that the ETH supply isn't shrinking...We have no blob fee market right now because we have more than enough blob space for the demand. The best response to that is *not* to artificially restrict blob space. Instead we should celebrate Ethereum's new-found scalability, and figure out how to increase demand.
11
**Correction**: Base ordering is a priority fee auction with first-come-first-served tie break. This means CEX-DEX arbitrage MEV is accruing to Coinbase as sequencer fees. Better DEX designs that don't leak MEV to the sequencer (instead rebating back to LPs) are coming with Uniswap v4 hooks—see for example [Sorella](https://sorellalabs.xyz/).

It's also worth noting that Etan's SSZ-ification proposal incorporates the "vectorization" part of EIP-7706 without the "new gas dimension for calldata" part, so we could get the simplification benefits even before we do all the work to agree that adding a separate dimension for calldata is safe.

> I have a vastly easier time making payments with crypto than I do with traditional finance...Well, this is anecdotal and not very evidential, as well as not being specific.  I'm not sure what "payments" you're making, but if you were very specific, then we could evaluate that claim and come up with a definitive true/false as to whether crypto was the best way to make such payments, but since you're just referencing "payments" in general, there's no way to qualify that claim...This is a very common response to the question: not enough specifics to test the claim...>My credit cards stop working regularly. ..Again, not specific.  Which credit card?  Which bank?  For what reason?..Most of us don't experience this problem.  So this is more vague, anecdotal citations that can't be verified...>International wires take days to pass through...There are plenty of ways to send value instantly outside the country, so without specifics, again we can't qualify whether or not crypto is the best solution to that problem. We do know there are plenty of other methods available though.  For more details see [this segment I made addressing the argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4118s)...>Sending ETH or stablecoin to an address is incredibly easy and finishes in seconds...This is solving a problem that doesn't exist in the real world.  This is exclusive to your ecosystem.  So it also doesn't address the question...When I go to pay my rent, or my taxes, or utilities or groceries, Eth or stablecoins are not a reasonable option.  That's in the *real world*.  The Ultimate Crypto Question asks: What does this tech do for *people in the real world*, not among a small subset of enthusiasts who are playing inside a particular ecosystem.  ..Also, your scenario presupposes that you already have a bunch of subsystems already in place: you've converted fiat to crypto (which takes time and fees), you've installed certain types of software to facilitate the transaction (which also takes time to audit properly since in the world of defi, there is no accountability and oversight of consumer protections), and you have to have access to the Internet and centralized systems necessary to make the transaction happen.  You assume all that is readily available and don't factor it in, but that's not the case with most people involved in daily commerce in the real world...Again, I can't argue against your specific, personal, anecdotal situation that you've submitted as being convenient and superior *for you*, but that doesn't mean the same situation applies to anybody else...And that's the operative issue. ..If you expect this tech to be more widely adopted, you have to have something better than cherry picked personal anecdotes that are too vague to be qualified.  The average person in the real world needs to see a scenario where this tech is the best solution to a common problem...PS:  Do you remember the last time I asked this question and you responded?   You cited NFTs as the best use-case example.  How do you feel about that now?..btw, any chance of getting you on my podcast?  I'd love to have a real time discussion with you on this and give you as much time as needed to state your case.

Does that mean the centralization of block building is inevitable, and so Ethereum focuses on minimizing the downsides it leads to?
1
But if rake-free it wouldn't be able to do any of those things...It's an interesting question as to whether a very small rake to be spent by a DAO on worthy causes would make the lottery more attractive than a genuinely rake-free one.
7
PoolTogether is different from usual government lotteries. They have a mechanism where the principal is not at risk, only interest on the principal...In terms of societal utility, yes, we can definitely do better than lotteries :) I'm just surprised that we don't yet have a super popular lottery on Ethereum. Hundreds of millions of people participate in government lotteries every year and we have a seemingly low-hanging opportunity to dramatically improve upon the government offerings.

> BTC built an excellent monetary premium without really caring about [...] trustless collateral..BTC has an extremely strong focus on hodling. One could argue that "savings" and "store of value" is a primitive form of collateral. You're locking money in a black box, reducing the velocity of money, to underwrite life's future expenses...> proposed by DCInvestor..Ha, maybe DC could try to join the EF :) Fun fact, in 2021 I tried to hire DC at the EF. The EF is, to a large extent, shaped by its constituent individuals...> Is there any possibility of the EF explicitly defining ETH the asset as such?..The EF really doesn't get to define what ETH is, that's up to the community! The EF is a tiny sliver of the Ethereum community and is itself internally "decentralised" across dozens of teams.

I'm not aware of any plan to sustainability :)

> Is the thinking that market forces would prevent these entities from withholding proofs and halting the chain?..The cost of maintaining the chain state should be small enough for the honest minority assumption to be credible. (Honesty minority assumptions are awesome BTW, much much easier to hold than the honest majority assumption which is required for consensus.)..If it costs, say, $100K/year to maintain Ethereum state because Ethereum is widely successful as the world's settlement layer I don't see that being a significant deterrent for explorers, exchanges, wallet operators, archivists, enthusiasts, etc. We may also see decentralised storage and retrieval of Ethereum state (e.g. Portal) to complement centralised operators.

Yeah, people are aware about it, there's people exploring the hash-based options too, and what the delta between the verkle-based implementation and the hash-based implementation would actually look like.

> Isn't the k == n case how it works currently?..Yes, exactly!..The issue is relative MEV across operators, not absolute MEV in any given slot. Large operators would have partial access to MEV as it is today whereas small operators would not. In the status quo every operator gets the same access to MEV, i.e. we have proposer fairness. With multi-proposing we lose proposer fairness.

**3. Discouragement attacks**..Stakers need to come to consensus under [listener--speaker fault equivalence](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/07/16/triangle_of_harm.html), something that opens up avenues for [discouragement attacks](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/4a3bc39e11acede672770475ab254a1a882a5bbe/papers/discouragement/discouragement.pdf). An attacker can act maliciously against honest consensus participants to deprive them of rewards, subsequently profiting as they leave and the staking yield increases. There exists various avenues even for [minority discouragement attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/11) at the present...With a fixed target participation level that adapts relatively quickly, the [p-elasticity](https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171#h-53-discouragement-attacks-32) becomes infinite. The incentives for discouragement attacks are then [maximized](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1542162089304784897), because less stake must leave to drive up the yield. The importance of discouragement attacks should not be overstated, but it is unnecessary to make them more viable when safer designs also are better in other respects...**4. Bounding a PID controller turns it into a suboptimal reward curve**..The protocol might of course bound the controller, and impose some maximum yield beyond which no further increases are deemed necessary (besides relying on the social layer and the threat of intervention). For good measure, the issuance policy may also define a floor, so that stakers always receive some yield, ensuring a viable composition of the staking set. Figure 8 in the related section of the FAQ plots such an updated target reward curve (in the long run). The rigid shape feels like a “poor man’s reward curve”. The fixed floor and ceiling should instead have the smooth characteristics of a reward curve, gradually increasing or decreasing as the utility function changes. ..**5. Avenues for a dynamic approach**..The outlined flaws do not mean that there is no value in a dynamic approach; it is possible to combine it with a reward curve. The idea would be to allow the reward curve to drift/bend at longer time scales, ultimately being influenced by a separate target reward curve. Such a "[time--quantity policy](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675#h-5-time-quantity-policy-35)" is explored in the answer on the staking economics endgame in the FAQ.

The “make ETH deflationary again” was tongue-in-cheek and I agree with most of your comments. The main point is that the blob fee market is not functioning as expected due to the low 1 wei fee and the unanticipated approaches by L2s to minimize their blob fees and competition for blob space per block.
3
1 wei is a mathematical problem as a price as it is the lowest possible unit...Above target fees are meant to increase by +12.5%; what's 12.5% of 1 wei? It is 0 wei; so the price adjustments need to be fudged at that level to be a 100% increase to 2 wei...The 18 decimals of Eth are for precision in fractions, not to set something at a value with no possible fractional delta
2
https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1831761080252539182..Given that priority fee makes up a large portion of revenue, wallets include high priority fee rather than boosting the basefee, and the base sequencer RPC doesn't accept txs with priority fee <100wei/gas, do you think this means L2 operators are mostly trying to avoid liability for frontrunning, but maximally extracting rent by being the sole sequencer?

> When I go to pay my rent, or my taxes, or utilities or groceries, Eth or stablecoins are not a reasonable option...Go somewhere where you can't rely on your country's fiat currency. I just spent nearly a year in Argentina and I paid my rent in stablecoins the entire time. And when I needed physical pesos, I bought them with stablecoins. These were the recipients' preferred payment methods in a country where everybody's forced to find creative ways out of the fiat system or lose their savings to inflation. Crypto has already been making it far easier for people in this situation

>Again, not specific. Which credit card? Which bank? For what reason?..>Most of us don't experience this problem. So this is more vague, anecdotal citations that can't be verified...Everyone experiences this problem. Credit cards expire...>Also, your scenario presupposes that you already have a bunch of subsystems already in place: you've converted fiat to crypto (which takes time and fees), you've installed certain types of software to facilitate the transaction (which also takes time to audit properly since in the world of defi, there is no accountability and oversight of consumer protections), and you have to have access to the Internet and centralized systems necessary to make the transaction happen. You assume all that is readily available and don't factor it in, but that's not the case with most people involved in daily commerce in the real world...Crypto wallets don't need to be funded by exchange-converted fiat. You can be paid by others who've already gone through the friction, or directly from the network (mining, staking). The more adoption there is, the more moot that point becomes...And you could have made other points against credit cards. Credit history, membership fees, late fees, not to mention merchant fees and equipment. Maybe it took [a hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card#Edward_Bellamy's_Looking_Backward) for the world to wrap its head around them, but they took off...>If you expect this tech to be more widely adopted, you have to have something better than cherry picked personal anecdotes that are too vague to be qualified. The average person in the real world needs to see a scenario where this tech is the best solution to a common problem...I think the fact we're using reddit proves this is not true. But to stay on theme, credit cards didn't need to replace cash or checks to be viable. They each have their perks. Crypto works most like debit cards, only you don't need a bank to have one. That's a perk for real people. To pull from an earlier comment:..>Nobody walked into a bank and ever said, "I want to open a decentralized checking account please."..Of course not; there was no such thing, and that's the last place to look for one. Instead they'd store cash and valuables under their mattresses, in safes, etc. Can't use those for online payments though.

"Inevitable" may be slightly too strong of a word. I'm cautiously optimistic something like SUAVE can build competitive blocks without a central operator.

There is merit to cohesive messaging and narrative tho

It's been mentioned/suggested a few times that EF would run some number of validators for some sustained income, is this idea scrapped?
3
I understand that k = 3 and k = 2 are worse for the small operator in the multi proposer world because the bigger operator can extract a bigger share of the MEV pie for the given slot which isn't fair...I assumed that in a multi proposer world, each proposer would get 1/4th of the gas limit as compared to single proposer world, so k = 4 scenario would be the exact same as status quo today i.e. a single entity is packing all transactions within a block. I don't understand how "things go astray" in this case as you described
1
**CONCERNING THE RUNWAY TO 50%**..In essence, if stake participation is to cross 50%, then 50% of prospective ETH token holders must find the risk/reward of staking worth it. As the costs of staking (broadly defined to include perceived risks, hardware, liquidity, etc) fall relative to equilibrium rewards, stake participation will rise. But this process does not follow a trajectory that can be accurately predicted beforehand, and we should also keep in mind that rewards will gradually fall as we approach 50%. It seems the likeliest that we will see a gradual slow increase over several years, and that a rather modest reduction in issuance could go a long way to temper this. ..There may of course also be some “frictions” in the decision to stake. The equilibrium of today would not necessarily persist even if costs and rewards remained the same. Users may gradually overcome these frictions such that stake participation grows.
9
Sure but my point is, you don't actually need a fee market if you don't have scarcity to begin with. And if L2s try to minimize the blob space they use, that's a good thing.
6
I don't see why we should expect L2s to not try and minimise their blob fees, at the end of the day blob fees are paid by the L2's users, and imo the north star of Ethereum (L1 and L2) should always be to serve users at the lowest price. It's important to make the distinction between blob base fee being "too low" on a technical basis (e.g., it takes too long to ramp up and thus it doesn't serve its purpose), vs it's "too low" according to a value accrual thesis that I find at odds with what I consider to be the goal of Ethereum.
6
A couple of data analysts are now going down the rabbit hole to understand what is going on :) It looks like CEX DEX arbs are a significant component. As mentioned above, better DEX designs that don't leak MEV to the sequencer are being designed—time will tell how this will change the contention-to-congestion fee ratio. Another theory that is being investigated is that wallets are improperly using legacy and hardcoding priority fees. This would be something that would naturally get fixed over time by wallets.

He wrote an expansive, thoughtful response with multiple points.  ..You were incapable of addressing any of it. Instead, you consider your position so frail and weak that the only thing you could do was to avoid it entirely with a dishonest summary and an *infantile* "dO yOu heAr YourSelf?"..It all makes sense why nearly all cryptobros are such feeble cowards; it starts at the top, where even the creators find their own positions so indefensible they can do nothing but tremble incessantly.

I think I said it nicer than that...Let's be honest though.  You guys are only comfortable inside your own chambers.  You'd never come on my show anyway.  But just in case you want to change your mind, the offer still stands.  If you listen to my podcast, you'll see I give all my guests plenty of time and respect.  It could be argued I show pro-crypto people too much consideration -- far more than they show us critics...It's not like I'm trying to attack you.  I just want straight answers to simple questions.  It shouldn't be that difficult...As I mentioned before... the *operative issue* is if you expect this tech to ever be mainstream, you have to be able to deal with criticism.  I'm not hostile towards you personally (unlike most crypto bros who are hostile towards me personally) - I just present counter arguments to yours that you consider hostile because you seem to be unable to prove them invalid...If you can't cross this divide with people like me, then you have to admit this tech will never be more than fringe.  I think we both know that, but only one of us is willing to admit it...Anyway, thanks for your time, but you didn't answer the question.  I can't lie about that.

> "you're just a small unrepresentative enthusiast"..btw, I would never call you an "unrepresentative enthusiast" but it is interesting, that *the creator of Ethereum* has no more insightful responses when asked, "What does this tech do?" than a rando crypto bro in this forum, who cites the same talking points that we've debunked years ago.   ..Look, I feel for you man... you're "pot committed" to this mess.  Your name's on it.  I bet you wish you could pull a "Satoshi" and disappear too.    But hey, at least you've made a ton of money.  But look at this industry... look at the people in it.. the grift... the scammers... the human traffickers..  the pump-and-dumps... the crazy authoritarians who pretend to espouse freedom and liberty?

Stablecoins, in substance, are units of a money market fund (1 USDt = 1 dollar). What blockchain or decentralized tech can be attributed to USDt when it's controlled by a single entity? ..Tether, a dumpster fire of criminality posing as a corporation, is conveniently based in the British Virgin Islands. They admit to such poor record-keeping that they can’t account for past reserves within a billion dollars and claim their books are too complex to audit—unlike nearly all money market funds that provide annual audited statements.

> Everyone experiences this problem. Credit cards expire...Most people get a replacement card before it expires.  Platforms will notify people their credit cards are about to expire and allow them to update the info. ..Again, this is not a fault with the technology.  It's a "feature" that's the result of consumer protection laws like The [Fair Credit Billing Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Billing_Act) - which insulates consumers from liability in cases of credit card fraud.  This is a *good* thing.  This is what everybody likes about credit cards.  It's not some "scheme" that banks foisted on people.  This is something people demanded after corporations started screwing them over, so the government (of the people) implemented these protections...Crypto bros seem completely ignorant of how modern society works in this respect, and we're seeing them slowly figure it out when they ask for "regulatory clarity" or they run to the courts to bail them out when they get screwed over in crypto schemes.

There are potential devops, governance and regulatory complications for an entity like the EF to stake—those may be surmountable. A nice devops tool we now have is anti-slasher TEEs that prevent staking operators from getting slashed accidentally or maliciously. I'd would only be comfortable operating validators for the EF with an anti-slasher TEE.
4
> I assumed that in a multi proposer world, each proposer would get 1/4th of the gas limit as compared to single proposer world..With multi-proposing, in the default case, proposers won't get meaningful MEV. The goal of multi-proposing is to prevent MEV extraction, but it prevents this extraction more for small operators than it does for big operators. This favours big operators and breaks proposer fairness.
1
Just want to echo this important point, because I think there has been a lot of conflating of these two aspects of the minimum blob base fee in the latest discourse. The kind of proposals that have been discussed aim to solve the former technical problem (~30 minutes for the fee to go up to a "non-negligible for humans" level in times of congestion), while still keeping the minimum fee itself as cheap as possible, to the point that the base fee without congestion is still essentially negligible...Trying to set the minimum fee at a non-negligible level for value accrual reasons is imo myopic, short-term thinking. Regardless, it is a big departure from the way Ethereum has been thinking about fees for a long time (base fees are exclusively pricing congestion), and would require a much bigger discussion.

While I agree with the skeptics at large that crypto is mostly bs, one use case for normal people in the real world definitely is cross border value transfer for a reasonable cost. Though hawala networks can do that too at better costs than western union and all those leeches.

Paypal takes a 5% fee for cross-border txs. Western Union's fees differ but they're high. ..I don't have time to go through your whole list but the fact that Cashapp only works in the US / UK and Venmo only works in the US makes me think you didn't think through this list either.

>This is a *good* thing. This is what everybody likes about credit cards...I partially agree. I've been a victim of fraud and enjoy consumer protections. And yes, expiration is no big deal for one-time transactions since a replacement arrives beforehand. Expiring a card that has not been exposed to fraud is a waste though. For online bill pay tied to expiring cards, it's an unnecessary source of friction, albeit a relatively small one, if you stay on top of it...Anyway, it's just my interpretation of "credit cards stop working regularly."..>You guys fabricate a specific scenario that is super-atypical..Everything is atypical at first. Like I said, it took decades for credit cards to become typical. Using the small size of an ecosystem against its adoption is more akin to the bandwagon fallacy. I think the point stands, but you prefer, have the equally valid inverse: the less adoption there is, the less moot that point becomes...>Debit cards have consumer protections. Crypto has none. They're entirely different. Debit cards are fast and efficient. Crypto is not...I was comparing to the list I'd made: credit cards, cash, and checks. It's card-like in that the available amount does not affect portability, unlike cash, and it can be used online, unlike cash and checks. It's cash-like since you must have the money to spend it, and it doesn't require a bank, unlike the other two...Crypto works most like debit cards because you can only spend money you actually have, and you can do it online. It's somewhere between debit cards and cash since you don't need a bank to use it. They all have their differences.
1
> one use case for normal people in the real world definitely is cross border value transfer for a reasonable cost...Again, this is too vague to qualify.  I can send cross-border payments all day long with very low rates, faster and easier and with more consumer protections using systems like Paypal.  So your argument doesn't hold water...For more see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4118s).

I'm not sure about those fees, *but* with Paypal and Western Union, you end up with FIAT.   You'd be subject to even higher fees and spread exchange rates converting crypto back into fiat. ..>Venmo only works in the US..Ok, so that's not good for cross-border payments but most of the others are.  Not all transactions need to go across borders... It's interesting how you guys cherry pick smaller and smaller scenarios in which to claim your tech works... so now it's only "cross border" payments where it's useful?..btw, I love how the new poster child for "cross border payments" is suddenly *Argentina?*  It used to be El Salvador, but now we have enough data to know that the crypto El Salvador experiment has failed miserably, so everybody pivots to another country where there's less research.  The "god of the gaps" argument applied to crypto...I bet the more we talked about this subject, the *smaller and smaller* your representative sample size becomes... then it will be limited to certain monetary amounts once it's proven that it is cheaper to send cross-border payments using non-crypto methods, you'll move the goalpost to apply to certain very large or very small amounts.  Then when that doesn't jive, you'll start cherry picking specific countries... in the end, your "use case" will most likely be illegal and involving sanctions evasion.  I've had this conversation before.
1
> Paypal takes a 5% fee for cross-border txs...According to their [fees page](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees) then the maximum fee (for international payments) is 4.99 USD, so if you send $1,000 then its only 0.5%...Still a bit surprising, as most platforms do “account to account” transfers free of charge, e.g. Revolut, Wise, and within the EU most banks will do EUR transfers within the EEA free of charge (and often instant).

> Expiring a card that has not been exposed to fraud is a waste though.  For online bill pay tied to expiring cards, it's an unnecessary source of friction, albeit a relatively small one, if you stay on top of it...Actually, select vendors do have the option of continuing to charge credit cards even if they are expired.  It's a feature that's available.  I've sometimes had to report my credit cards stolen, and certain vendors could still charge to that card on file even though it was replaced with different expiration and CCV numbers...However, it's always a good idea to rotate credit card ID data.  You never know when a database has been compromised.  This assures the credit card companies that if there are breaches that result in fraud, it's within a certain time frame and that helps with tracking down where the breaches occurred...>Everything is atypical at first. Like I said, it took decades for credit cards to become typical. Using the small size of an ecosystem against its adoption is more akin to the bandwagon fallacy. I think the point stands, but you prefer, have the equally valid inverse: the less adoption there is, the less moot that point becomes...Yea, the "It's still early!" argument is way way **old**.   Blockchain is coming up on 16 years and still can't do anything uniquely useful, and by every measurable metric, is inferior to existing tech.  This isn't a case of needing more time for the tech to prove itself.  Apparently it's *needing more time before you guys finally admit the truth about this useless tech*.  I hate to put it so bluntly, but it's crazy this scheme has lasted as long as it has -- it's certainly not because of utility.  It's just the momentum from a certain small group of powerful special interests who are large bagholders and recognize it as a way to fleece gullible people who dream of getting rich on emerging tech.  But blockchain isn't emerging tech.  It's really old tech that is propped up by lies and deception...> it doesn't require a bank..Crypto requires even more intermediaries than traditional transactions.  You claim it's "P2P" but in reality it's not.  You require elaborate networks of middlemen, including producers of software (whom largely have no accountability or oversight in the industry) to miners and node operators -- many of whom are centralized.  When you "send crypto" to someone, you're not even directly interacting with that other peer.  You're both talking to middlemen managing a central database stored on the Internet called "blockchain."  All the people operating the blockchain are necessary in order for the system to even exist, and if they can't profit from maintaining the blockchain, the entire system can disappear.  And there are 30,000+ dead cryptocurrencies to prove that...>Crypto works most like debit cards because you can only spend money you actually have, and you can do it online. It's somewhere between debit cards and cash since you don't need a bank to use it. They all have their differences...No. Sorry.  Stop calling crypto "money."  Crypto is not money any more than "Dominos Pizza Points" are "money."  They're abstract digital tokens that *some* people think are valuable, but in order to use them, you have to find somebody who is like-minded and willing to accept them for goods and services.  That rules out 99.99999% of the world.  "Money" is that which is the most common form of payment for goods and services.  Crypto is not "money."..This is why I get annoyed trying to engage with crypto people.  You simply aren't being honest.  You appropriate common terms like "money" trying to pretend your tokens are legal tender, when they are not.  You promote your schemes via misinformation and deception.  If you were at least honest, I'd have more respect, but you can't promote your schemes without being deceptive.

> It’s interesting how you guys cherry pick smaller and smaller scenarios in which to claim your tech works... so now it’s only “cross border” payments where it’s useful?..You asked for specific. This is a specific and significant use case. The cost of converting back to fiat argument can be valid, but it is definitely faster to send crypto cross border than fiat which also incurs conversion costs and all that. It’s however also true the slowness is a feature to do AML checks and slow down fraud.

>However, it's always a good idea to rotate credit card ID data. You never know when a database has been compromised...It's a good idea because to complete a credit card transaction online, we have to give up all the info needed to use the card, which is inherently problematic, especially when third parties offer to store thousands in the same place. It doesn't need to be this way. It's improving with TFA, but  it's more friction, and it's not standard yet. Things take time...>Yea, the "It's still early!" argument is way way **old**...I think you're right that this argument needs an expiration date (see what I did there), but when the corollary in question took decades, 16yrs looks fine to me, or 11yrs since Ethereum's conception. To be fair, before the internet, credit cards required physical infrastructure which didn't help with adoption. So I think expecting a shorter timeline for internet-based tech makes sense. How much shorter, I couldn't guess...In any case, all we can do about the timeline now is contribute to projects. If there'd been no progress for years, then I'd be concerned. Actively dismissing something because it's still in development and/or still unpopular sounds unproductive. I think you would add to this list, perhaps first and foremost, that you dismiss crypto because it is has no use-cases, even though I described the gap it fills between debit cards and cash, to say nothing of the programmability Ethereum offers...>"Money" is that which is the most common form of payment for goods and services. Crypto is not "money."..Please cite who defines money as the "most common" anything. By that definition there can be no new money. There's always a most common form of payment. We can't call less common forms "money?" Makes me wonder how the euro, as non-money in its infancy, ever became money...Even if we entertain that qualifier, we'd still need to define boundaries. Most common in Europe, for example. Most common in the Solomon Islands in the 1800s. Most common on the internet. Most common on OpenSea. There are so many contexts for money.

Your example is not specific...Here's an example of a specific argument:..Person in countryA needs to send X to person in countryB so they can use the money for Y...We need the source country, the amount transferred and in what units, the destination country, and what the value is to be spent on...Then we can actually evaluate the claim.  Just "sending money across borders" is too vague to qualify...What ultimately we find out when we drill down into specifics, is the person advocating crypto is promoting an *illegal* activity: tax evasion, money laundering, sanctions evasion, etc... those are the only "use-cases" where crypto might seem like a reasonable alternative, and as part of my question, I specifically ask for non-illegal examples...If you're bypassing AML laws or tax reporting, or countries in violation of their laws, that's criminal activity.  We want a non-criminal example.  This is why you have to be specific...If that's all you have, are dark-market use-cases, then just admit it.  No sense beating around the bush.

I meant to respond to this paragraph too...>Crypto requires even more intermediaries than traditional transactions. You claim it's "P2P" but in reality it's not. You require elaborate networks of middlemen, including producers of software (whom largely have no accountability or oversight in the industry) to miners and node operators -- many of whom are centralized...How many more intermediaries does crypto have than traditional transactions? If you're saying every miner/staker or node operator is an intermediary, then yes, in a decentralized chain there are many...Posing the many intermediaries as a problem confuses me. The redundancy of node operating software is why oversight isn't needed, and why settlement can be trusted in seconds. The thing every node can agree on is the truth. Coordinating a lie in your favor requires prohibitive resources, convincing the majority to side with you, or buying enough to do it yourself...When you then say some of those are centralized, you lose me. That would mean there are *not* many of them, putting them on par with traditional transaction intermediaries...>When you "send crypto" to someone, you're not even directly interacting with that other peer. You're both talking to middlemen managing a central database stored on the Internet called "blockchain." All the people operating the blockchain are necessary in order for the system to even exist..Right, there is no direct interaction. Unlike torrents where you connect to each other to transfer a file, the recipient doesn't need to be online. That would be awful. You just broadcast to the network, and I'm paraphrasing, "Move amount X from wallet A to wallet B." Assuming everything checks out (you cryptographically proved you own A and had X + fee), X moves directly from A to B. That's P2P, unlike with banks where X is missing from both A and B all weekend...I'm not sure how blockchain can be both a central database and require "all the people" to run it, but I am sure all the people aren't necessary. It'd still run with half the people, it'd just be half as decentralized. People who care about that would make a judgement call...>and if they can't profit from maintaining the blockchain, the entire system can disappear. And there are 30,000+ dead cryptocurrencies to prove that...Agreed about incentives to maintain a blockchain. I would just add that if anyone could fork a credit card company to launch their own from home, there'd be 30,000+ dead credit card startups too. Put another way, the vast majority of forks of all kinds are dead. I wouldn't read into it.

> It's a good idea because to complete a credit card transaction online, we have to give up all the info needed to use the card, which is inherently problematic, especially when third parties offer to store thousands in the same place. It doesn't need to be this way. It's improving with TFA, but it's more friction, and it's not standard yet. Things take time...But it's *not* inherently problematic due to central authorities implementing legislation like The Fair Credit Billing Act which puts the liability for fraud on the hands of the banks and not the consumers.  So they implement anti-fraud protections for us.  This is why credit cards are so ubiquitous -- because they work very well for consumers *despite* there always being a possibility of fraud...>I think you're right that this argument needs an expiration date (see what I did there), but when the corollary in question took decades, 16yrs looks fine to me, or 11yrs since Ethereum's conception. To be fair, before the internet, credit cards required physical infrastructure which didn't help with adoption. So I think expecting a shorter timeline for internet-based tech makes sense. How much shorter, I couldn't guess...What is missing from the crypto equation that will make it more ubiquitous?  WHY do you need more time?..In the case of say, the Internet, what we needed were more/cheaper access to computers and the network.  It was very obvious what was holding adoption up...So what is holding adoption up of crypto?..If you can't answer that question in a simple, obvious way that everybody acknowledges, then you can't say "It's still early."..>In any case, all we can do about the timeline now is contribute to projects. If there'd been no progress for years, then I'd be concerned. Actively dismissing something because it's still in development and/or still unpopular sounds unproductive. I think you would add to this list, perhaps first and foremost, that you dismiss crypto because it is has no use-cases, even though I described the gap it fills between debit cards and cash, to say nothing of the programmability Ethereum offers...The "programmability" that Ethereum offers is still about a hundred years behind the functionality of a modern day Wordpress site...You think "smart contracts" are a big deal?  That feature has been available in standard databases for decades.  The technical term for it is called, "stored procedures" and in traditional databases they're much more powerful than in blockchain...Blockchain databases are incredibly inefficient by design.  Modern relational databases have much more utility and flexibility.  In the case of Eth's smart contracts, the immutable design of blockchain means that you can have buggy vulnerable code codified in the database that you can never fix or remove.  That's a huge problem...>Please cite who defines money as the "most common" anything...Google it. Look in any dictionary...https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/money..>1: something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment..Most people do not consider crypto to be a form of payment, medium of exchange, or measure of value...I get that you people do, but you are statistically insignificant...>Even if we entertain that qualifier, we'd still need to define boundaries. Most common in Europe, for example. Most common in the Solomon Islands in the 1800s. Most common on the internet. Most common on OpenSea. There are so many contexts for money...True.  Context matters.  Which is why the most common sense version of "money" is simply to assume "fiat" - the official legal tender of whatever community you're talking about.  In El Salvador, you could consider bitcoin to be "money" because it is legal tender, but actually El Salvador's "bitcoin" is not even on the bitcoin blockchain, so it could be argued that it's a fork or it's simply using the bitcoin name for a private digital transaction system called "Chivo."

Like a lot of real world expatriates, say someone wants to send $1000 monthly to family in a south Asian country. Unless I got it wrong it seems PayPal charges 5% for the money transfer and a further 4% for currency conversion. Sounds like a liquid highly used crypto could do it cheaper and equally fast even if one includes converting back to fiat if needed.
3
Again, you fail to properly answer the question.  You also assume "sending crypto" = "sending money" which is false...So you send $1k worth of ETH from the US to India.   ..1.  You pay a spread exchange and fee to convert USD to ETH..2.  You pay a fee to transfer ETH..3.  The recipient still needs to covert ETH into Rupees, the standard currency, so that involves additional fees and spread exchange charges...There is *no way* it's cheaper to send using crypto than existing non-crypto methods...You weasel around this by:..1.  Ignoring the fees, delays and hassles involved in converting fiat to Eth..2.  Ignoring the fees, delays and hassles involved in converting Eth to Rp...This is misleading and disingenuous.  ..And IF you find a scenario where no conversions are necessary, this is the exception, not the rule.  Everybody knows it.

The Metamask website states that their "validator staking" solution makes use of the Consensys Staking service. There's some info on the Consensys website on that topic, as well as this article that gives some top-level explanations: https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-staking-diverse-stakers-one-solution..I couldn't find any detailed explanation of how they manage your deposit, but if I had to guess, it's probably similar to how some of the larger exchanges offer staking services. You could try searching for those instead to get an idea. But if you're specifically interested in how Metamask does it, it's probably best to reach out directly to them.

Mestamask is a wallet that also acts as a middleman when interacting with the blockchain. Ex. Your ledger nano is a vold that stores private keys for your address on the blockchain. Now, metamask with an attached ledger can interact with another web3 service, such as lido, to stake your ETH.  ..Ledger + metamask + lido is one of the best combinations available in the crypto world.

Interesting, no one commented but already 3 guys sent me DM with an "instruction" to "validate" my wallet before I'm able to stake with metamask.

Idk if you checked out [https://ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) recently but the supply is increasing since April (since Dencun upgrade)...It depends on wether or not ETH fees go back above 15 gwei, which is the threshold to ETH being deflationary.
21
It depends on how popular Ethereum gets (how much fees gets paid across the chain and thus how much gets burned). ..In a bearish scenario where there is little activity, supply will keep increasing indefinitely, using inflation to fund validators and keeping the chain secure. ..In a bullish scenario, with lots of adoption, yes, supply steadily decrease and eventually plateau around some level lower than today...I don't want to make a comment on how likely either scenario is.
8
The objective is to put 700 trillion financial assets on the blockchain...So deflation will return to Ethereum..But that doesn't change anything +0.70% or -0.70%, when the growth potential is 300% to 1000% in 5 or 10 years.
19
Definitely a possibility. If Ethereum keeps growing and burning outpaces issuance, we could see a gradual decrease in supply over time.

That's another crypto myth.

I used to really like eth. Not so much anymore. If it becomes deflationary the transaction fees are crazy expensive. When the transaction fees are low its inflationary, either way its not a blockchain thats ideal to use

It's such a beautiful design, minimal inflation if it's being lightly used, minimal deflation if it's being heavily used.

This. If usage is high, fees and burns reduce the supply over time. In a low-activity scenario, inflation keeps increasing the supply. It's hard to predict which way things will go,

Right.. everything would be better if it was just an echo chamber of sycophants?  You think r/bitcoin is any closer to the truth than y 'all?..If any of this tech has any long term viability, you all have to be able to engage with critics and prove the viability of your ideas.  Both the bitcoin and the ethereum camps would rather pretend nothing else exists outside of their walled "de-centralized" gardens...I'm just here reminding you there's another part of the world -- a much larger one, that still exists.. (for as long as they'll let me - and much respect to the mods for doing so).

The proofing system has nothing to do with the viability of a coin. In fact, I'd say that ETH is more future proof than Bitcoin because it doesn't consume the energy of an entire country. I can imagine BTC switching as well because some governments might start banning it for ecological reasons.

BTC POW is doomed long-term. The miners are already securing the Bitcoin network at a loss. It currently costs over $75,000 on average to mine 1 BTC. And the BTC price hovers around $58,000. That's $17,000 below the cost to mine. Why would you mine if you could buy BTC? And if you stop mining and start buying, who secures the network?!..[https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost)

> How is Bitcoin inflatable...There is more than $160 Billion in unsecured stablecoins (USDT, etc.) being traded back and forth for BTC as if they were actual money/liquidity, despite there not being any evidence that liquidity is real.  These stablecoins are what's driving the price of BTC up - aka "inflating" the price of bitcoin.  It's not organic demand.  It's bots engaged in wash trading.  This is well known via numerous peer-reviewed studies.  ..Just because bitcoin has a limited supply, doesn't mean it can't be affected by inflation...As long as you allow inflatable tokens like USDT, USDC and others to be traded for BTC, you can and will introduce inflation into the BTC market.

The funds arrived in 60 seconds and within 24 hours the USD FIAT was in my checking account...Credit card companies like American Express for example don't provide access to transactions or statements going back 12 years for example. You can have a paper copy or a downloaded statement. What if you lost the paper copy or forgot / opted out of downloading a copy? What if you need the transaction as proof for whatever reason? With crypto the transaction could always be accessible for the life of the blockhain...Tradfi is centralized. Decentralized is more valuable in the long run. It is not easy to provide decentralized AND fast. But it will get there eventually.

>Stop spending all your time hating on something that has no effect on you. You post history is sad bro..#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #27 (hate)..**"Cope"** / **"Why do you hate crypto?"** / **"You all are haters"** / **"Why so salty?"** / **"You wish for other peoples misfortunes?"** / "**Why do you care about crypto?  Why not just ignore it?**".. 1.  By and large, we do not "hate" bitcoin or crypto.  Hate is an irrational, emotional condition.  Most people here have a logical, rational reason for being opposed to crypto. (see \#2).. 2.  What we do not like is **fraud and deception** - this is mainly what our community opposes, and the crypto industry is almost completely composed of fraud and misinformation, from claiming that [blockchain has potential](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) to pretending crypto is "digital gold" or an "investment" when it's really a highly-risky, negative sum game, speculative commodity.  .. 3.  It's an offensive distraction to suggest our reasons for being opposed to crypto are because of "hate", or "being salty" and supposedly jealous of not getting in earlier and making money.  We recognize there are many other ways of creating value that don't involve promoting everything from cyber terrorism to human trafficking... 4.  While some take amusement at the misfortunes of those playing the crypto Ponzi scheme, one main reason for this is because so many in the industry are so immune to logic, reason, and evidence, many of us feel they have to become cautionary tales before they finally learn (and some never learn) - what we celebrate is perhaps the chance that many of those losers finally see the error of their ways.  .. 5. Crypto is not a benign industry. Just for bitcoin to exist, requires wasting tremendous amounts of energy. This is not a "live and let live" situation.  Crypto schemes cause damage to actual people, the environment and promote all sorts of criminal, immoral activities. It's not morally acceptable to ignore something that causes much more harm to society than good... 6.  Why would anybody spend time trying to stop fraud and scams that might not directly affect them? Some of us recognize we help ourselves by helping our overall community. If you still don't understand, speak to a therapist about your lack of empathy and the possible side effects such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.  Those are issues people with low empathy have.  Understanding the nature of your illness may help you not only understand us, but become a less toxic person socially.

I can see how it might look like I was contradicting myself.  It depends upon the context.  But even if I did, that doesn't mean the arguments I made are not valid.  I can make a good argument that yes, blockchain isn't really decentralized.  You merely went "nah uh!" without providing any evidence...The Internet is a combination of centralized (DNS/ARIN/etc) and decentralized systems.  ..It is controlled by central authorities.  So if you put a so-called "de-centralized" system on a network where central entities can control things, that decentralized system is beholden to centralized entities.  We can argue whether it's really decentralized in any meaningful way.  ..I make this argument more specifically [in this video I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=783s).

Sure you can set up a local mesh network.  But that doesn't mean it's suitable for international commerce.  A blockchain needs to be relatively ubiquitous and accessible *in real time* from a wide variety of disparate locations.  By nature, a mesh network would be troublesome for such an application.  We're talking about a monetary system that is supposed to be respected from one continent to another.  That's not an application suitable for a mesh network.

Title: If Polygon shut down, what's going to happen to my Polygon Bridget Ethereum?
10
WARNING ABOUT SCAMS: Recently there have been a lot of convincing-looking scams posted on crypto-related reddits including fake NFTs, fake credit cards, fake exchanges, fake mixing services, fake airdrops, fake MEV bots, fake ENS sites and scam sites claiming to help you revoke approvals to prevent fake hacks. These are typically upvoted by bots and seen before moderators can remove them. Do not click on these links and always be wary of anything that tries to rush you into sending money or approving contracts....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1
If Ethereum shutdown, what will happen to your eth? Will you be able to sell them?..Answer is no to all of them.
25
some rollups have a way to forcefully withdraw funds in the event that the infrastructure fails. however polygon PoS is not a rollup, it's only a sidechain.
4
Polygon is one of the most active chains out there. It's not gonna shut down any time soon
7
How would Polygon "shut down".....Polygon is a blockchain, as long as there's nodes & validators, it'll keep running
13
*If only there was an oracle service to give that information.*
2
If the US Federal government collapsed, what will happen to my US dollars, OP?
3
No of course not
2
Most like the price will dip 90% from here than it can shut down
1
It depends, did they shut down their bridge too? If yes, you get nothing back.
1
I think if you are asking that question, it's probably time to move your assets.
0
Is this a polygon is dead post?..You know what that means
0
Edit: I misread the question. This is correct answer.
1
I mean, depends if it’s ETH on chain or if you hold it on an exchange. You could still buy and sell Solana on most exchanges during its down time.

I feel like you just answered your own question.

Crowdstrike will shut it down

Having downtime is different from having the network shutdown?

Seems to me like it was a rhetorical question.

Yeah, a self-answering one. Thus my reply.

Never take advice from anyone in this sub.

Both
17
Asking an ETH Subreddit if you should invest in ETH or BTC is like going to Wendy’s n asking if they have a Whopper 💀 bruh what.
20
Dude it's 1500 bucks, either yolo it or use that money to do some skill training to make more money.
15
As someone who has held in both for 2-3 years, I wish I had gone all in on BTC. Its return has been significantly better than my ETH.
31
Not sure why so many negative comments about ETH on an ETH community. I don’t think you can go wrong with either depends how much you own of each imo
6
Blockchains are like the internet in the early 90s. They will change the world...But I would only invest what you can afford to hold for 10+ years. You can't go wrong with either BTC or ETH.
6
Ethereum’s demand stems from its versatility as a decentralized world computer, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) across finance, gaming, supply chains, and more. Its programmable blockchain attracts developers and businesses looking for trustless, transparent solutions, driving innovation and adoption beyond simple value transfer like Bitcoin.
2
Eth is a security with a team running it (very poorly btw). Eth doesn’t have a use case and its value is imaginary. Its own foundation is dumping tons of it everyday on these holders in this sub who are clueless about how money works. No work went into creating eth, it was literally created into existence with a  mouse click. On the other hand millions of hashes went into creating every Bitcoin which actually require both time and massive amounts of energy to produce. Ask yourself, are you going to spend your 1500$ on something worthless that was created from thin air with no work behind it? Or are you going to buy the HARDEST to produce commodity humans have ever come in contact with? Which do you believe is worth your hard earned money more?
2
No one wants the decentralized computer, but if the price goes up, they will talk non stop about that computer.
2
We’re in a period of extreme fear this past month.  It’s not uncommon for crypto to cycle from extreme fear to extreme greed rapidly hence the negative sentiment you see here on down days like today.  That being said I think ETH definitely has some upside when BTC turns positive again.  This is a better entry point than anyone has had all year!  ..Personally I think we bottom out this month and see new ATH for BTC ETH SOL and many cryptos before the year is out.  My reasoning is this:  retail and normal peoples opinion doesn’t really move the markets like the whales.  All of these emotional rises and dips are made by market makers to entice and shake people out of the market.  There is an old meme that has accurately predicted the price of BTC at 8 different points far apart during periods of high market volatility and impressive moves and we’re coming up on one this month that predicts BTC to a new ATH.
2
Someone told me my xrp was a $hit coin. I swapped it into Eth and now I’m down $300.
2
This is an extreme amount of contemplation for $1500 lol.

OP - just use that money to swing trade crypto. You could easily make 1 million per day.
2
Read the book DeFi and the Future of Finance. It gives a good look into DeFi and gives you a good understanding about it...Im no dev. As well, but i love to use DeFi. And im really convinced that its something the world needs.
2
BTC is a greater fool game. The average investor is mathematically guaranteed to lose money. Nobody wants Bitcoin's "functionality", they buy it because they think it'll go up. ..If it was an actual currency used for buying and selling things then it might be different but those days are long gone...I'm not saying you should buy ETH - for price discussion go to r/ethtrader not here - but don't buy BTC as an investment.
3
Why not both?..Old el paso!  Na na na na na na
1
Mastering Ethereum is not a good source. Antonopoulous rushed it and it's lacking in details. Keep hanging around the forums to help you decide.
1
It is difficult to invest money in something you do not understand. So start small, just buy ETH and btc worth 50 usd and start following the news. Once you are more comfortable, you can invest more.

Giving Financial advice on the go with little prep time is quite a hard task, but let me give it a try. First of all, things can go in either direction so if you would like the best results you'd have to either approach someone with experience on this or have tested the market or are willing to fall and learn and get back up again...I'd say put it in an account that has no or low fees and invest a small portion for test and lab purposes if you training. Test the market and find your strategy then apply it in drop-feed levels...Keep an eye out for chances every now and then as you grow...As for the decentralized world computer, only time will tell. The cloud is a soft example of this (sometimes dApps), this website and the resources etc... too is an example of shared decentralized resources sometimes across vast distances (these Blockchain solutions just put a number or value on it and turns it into 'money") the internet in general and if the dApps, de-fi thing kicks off it will be Web 3.0. All ? Still only time will tell we are in the very early stages of this tech and that is the info I could give you based on this tech. You could look at ity from a uses standpoint, understand the technologies involved and make an educated guess. One of the best ways to invest is knowing what you are investing in, you can't invest in tomatoes if you aren't a seasoned farmer just like you can't invest in cpu's if you think cpu's are called "calls pour u"...So there you have, I hope this little info helps. And don't be shy about asking away. Also visit the ethtraders subreddit and others to get a better idea. I have shared the tech side you look into the financial side next...Also, if you are looking to do it, I am also investing in it and would like it if we maybe team up and combine funds to mine bigger ones. Send me a chat if you are ok, otherwise thanks for reading this far...  .edit: Techwise some investors and Techpreneurs prefer to build on Eth/Btc protocol or Algo (sort of a layer) to their technology, some prefer to build and redefine the wheel and create new cryptocoin. It is upto you to do your research.

Definitely BTC

My friend made £240k off £20k invested in 2017.. I missed the boat for huge returns, I think….. so have been buying the dips and dollar cost averaging with eth.. I doubt I’ll make gains anywhere near my early investor friend.. but I think I might make moderate gains…. on eth , if I time it right in the next bull cycle.. And ignore influencers self-motivated advice....I don’t think there is anything such as a good coin in investment terms. Unless you got in early with btc....In all other alt investments; I believe; that you make any potential profit at someone else’s expense..

Mixing it up a little can be smart—having most of your portfolio in Bitcoin is solid, but adding some Ethereum could give you a taste of its tech and growth potential in things like decentralized apps
1
Both $BTC and $ETH are decades long plays. ..Sony is building an L2 on Ethereum. The world's most successful memecoin (by many metrics) is built on top of Ethereum (Shiba Inu). Uniswap is the most successful dApp in history—built on Ethereum. Governments are writing laws on Ethereum. There's an $ETH ETF. ..In the end... being a Bitcoin maxi is probably not *THE* play...My opinion? Never sell either for fiat.
1
Go all in ethereum. If you are crypto believer ethereum is going to be a big part of it. Plus there will be an alt coin season like it has always been some day and eth will be the first one to go at all time highs. So, just YOLO and relax!
1
If you have to ask Reddit, chances are "neither" is the only right answer for you.
1
My sense in reading your question is that you're looking to get in on a lotto ticket here with your question. While it's certainly possible that your 1,500 might get absurd returns in the future, betting it all on one is probably not the right way to go given the amounts involved. Your best bet is to diversify (and that doesn't just mean BTC and ETH, but look at other assets outside of crypto too if you don't have any holdings otherwise). Best of luck!
1
I think it would be good to look into the various dapps and L2s/rollups/sidechains on ethereum to see history and progression. ..It’s also good to diversify your portfolio, however this is only if, after doing thorough research, you find ethereum attractive.

80% btc 20% eth

Btc

Right now? ETH. Midterm w/enough liquity always BTC w/2 or 3 months interval for trade. Im caucius maybe. US election results, that explains the interval. W/Harris overregulation from miners pov. W/Trump ¡Viva Caligula! From miners pov. In fact is more about Austen’s Sense and sensibility i think.

>bitcoin and see a lot of value in its functionality...What functionality? It's like gold. A majority of gold mined is just hoarded to prop up the value of gold.
1
I was listening to Bloomberg radio early this morning.  A random financial show...They get on the subject of crypto and have some analyst on talking about it.  The guy talks for 5 minutes about BTC, basically saying it just follows the stock market with about 3x volatility.  ..At the end, the host says “What about ETH and Dogecoin and everything else?”  The analyst says that the just follow BTC to a lesser degree.  ..I feel like I could read this two ways:..1. The people with money think there’s just BTC and non-BTC with no difference between different non BTC coins.  BTC is all that matters and ignore everything else...2.  We are still early and the monied people don’t understand the utility that some of these coins have utility that BTC doesn’t, which means buy more...Long story short, I don’t know.
1
None. Put your money is VOO S&P 500 and let it ride for long term. Unless if you are gambling then ETH for short term.

Eth raid on 1:10, 0.1 q.ty main spot out on 10% liquid, try, test, then increase at 0.5

Safer to maintain a personal Index fund weighting for whatever you buy.
1
why not both 50/50? alternatively but wot i would do is go further down the top 100 on CMC and try and pick one that is developing that less people know about and try and get more bang for you buck, u might get something that can 10x as opposed to 2 or maybe 3.
1
Btc
1
Don't listen to the bagholders here. ETH is dying
1
BTC will be more scarce in the future with the hard cap. ETH on the other hand will be unlimited
1
Since you're 90% in btc already, diversifying into ETH is a no brainer.
1
There is zero demand for decentralised computer ..End of story...Eth is an experiment and a very obvious dead end.
1
Dont do it. Gas fees are insane. They need to work that out.
1
Both BTC and ETH are strong choices. I personally diversified and bought both using net coins crypto exchange
1
The future will only see one blockchain, just like there is only one internet. Obviously it will be Bitcoin.
1
70% btc, 30% eth
1
If you already have alot of BTC then get some Eth.   I am all in on Eth!
1
if the budget is really that much, prefer eth only because the prospect of eth also for the long term is more or less the same as btc, you can buy eth at btse exchange besides there is eth, There are also other interesting coins to invest 
1
My recommendation wouldn’t be on how to invest the $1500, but on which tools to use to learn how DeFi works. If you don’t have any ethereum, you’ll need some for gas, and you can convert some of your BTC to wBTC to use in DeFi on Ethereum, like in Aave (which I like to use inside of DefiSaver)...Antop’s book is fantastic, but the best way to learn is by doing
1
I don't trust PoS anymore coinbase and lido are literally controlling ETH staking

Learn more about it and the answer will be obvious

ETH BTC chart movement is identical. It doesn't matter as much honestly. BTC is still #1.

I haven't been keeping up on the markets lately so I may not be the best person to get advice from. However in the past I made around 3,300$ profit from ethereum. However I have made very little profit in comparison with Bitcoin and in fact one time even lost $1,800 from a $10,000 Bitcoin investment... Not to say you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin you certainly should when you want to.  I just as easily could have made profit on the Bitcoin like I had with the ethereum but instead lost money due to making a bad decision to sell and letting emotions creep in. Losing $1,800 was a slap in the face but it was a really good lesson learned for when I make future investments. .. What it all comes down to is exactly when you choose to buy and exactly when you choose to sell. Buy at lows and trophs and wait and be patient until a significant increase is seen. There are perpetual ups and downs in all markets and especially with cryptocurrency.

If you already got BTC, then as Wu Tang would say ..... ..[https://youtu.be/DdSfTsTSjwA?si=AWJkTJSJigjBzOmk](https://youtu.be/DdSfTsTSjwA?si=AWJkTJSJigjBzOmk)

An internet computer has no need for a token. Read that a few times then think hard if buying ETH is a good bet.

ETH is failing.  Bitcoin will still be around when ETH is just a part of crypto history
-15
Now I’m unsure if I should take your advice on taking advice from anyone in this sub because you’re in this sub too…../s

Take everything you see here with a pinch of salt
6
Good advice, as this sub consists of at the least 90% bitcoin/shitcoin trolls.
5
To a strong degree if this case fits their situation then yes. That is also a way to go. It will in the long run allow them to invest a lot more (unless otherwise something happens).
2
Valid - I think the OP is perhaps looking to understand which one is more likely to yield the lotto win given the question. Your point is probably one of the best though.
2
You could easily start a 5-10k a month business with $1500.
1
Significantly better so far. We are about to go into a season of easing monitary policy (USA) that could help out riskier assets. When i say riskier, I just mean ETH is riskier than BTC.
11
If you had held both for 5 years instead of 2-3 years, ETH would be the one that paid off most.
11
Being one of the only crypto subs that don't censor people for having Bad Opinions, we have a lot of people here who aren't Ethereum enthusiasts...
8
And just like there is one internet protocol (tcp/ip), there will only be one money protocol (btc)...Eth will die, networks trend to one especially money networks.

Elaborate why the smartest, most wealthy and most brilliant people hold btc then for all different reasons?
5
The black market definitely uses bitcoin for its functionality. Drugs, fraud, tax evasion, corruption. As well as people trying to hide transactions from oppressive governments in the third world. Bitcoin is a genuine currency, on a much bigger scale than eth. Eth is more of a proof of concept, it's not really used for anything important, bitcoin is the preferred currency for large groups of people. As I understand it, monero is as well ..Bitcoin also has the advantage of being the poster boy for crypto. Any sweeping pro crypto regulation in the consumer market, will pump bitcoin the most

What?

Significantly better in a period of relative boom. We're now approaching markets running out of steam, with lots of very highly priced tech stocks...I'd like to believe it will improve but I fear that the ETF 'effect' has already been built into the ETH price. I suspect that Russia will legalise crypto, BTC will go up even more and ETH won't keep track...I'll keep HODLing for now.
3
Yep. I've owned both for over 4 years. I'm 11X ETH, 6X BTC.
4
I’m not sure why anyone would join a crypto sub just to hate on it. Seems like a giant waste of time
1
There were multiple networks that existed before the internet. They came together after TCP/IP to form the internet...The same will happen with blockchains. The TCP/IP equivalent is nascent or has not been invented yet.
2
Some of the most wealthy people hold BTC because they bought them really early and sold some of them. But since BTC is now just a greater fool game, their profits (and also mine as I also bought BTC early then cashed out) can only come from some later investor. If you're buying now, you're the person who is paying for the profits of the early investors. ..So thanks, I guess...
1
> The black market definitely uses bitcoin for its functionality. Drugs, fraud, tax evasion, corruption. As well as people trying to hide transactions from oppressive governments in the third world...It's true there's still a little bit of actual usage left but it's in decline. Darknet markets are using Monero, people doing any kind of commerce are using stablecoins...The only place where BTC still works best is for ransomware, because it's the easiest for the victim to understand how to buy. But with crypto constantly growing, you can't rely long-term on people not knowing how to buy it and send it.
2
I agree. Diversification is a good thing. I own other, hopefully, not shitcoin as well, but the bulk of it all is BTC & ETH
1
The opposite, that Bitcoin is overvalued and has become a "buy now to get rich quick" coin for dumb people with FOMO.

7 years. 11x ETH, 26x BTC

So we have a couple of friendly blockchain skeptics who mostly hang out on r/buttcoin and want to spread their message that blockchains are bad. But mostly it's just people who like some other coin and don't like people competing with it. ..We filter a couple of the really spammy ones but we mostly let the BTC maxis say their piece. BTC maximalism isn't the force it once was, I think most people who like BTC buy a bunch of other things as well nowadays.
4
I get your point. So Ethereum works the other way around, so that later buyers are more privileged than early buyers?..I struggle to understand the part why btc is worse than eth or any other digital asset powering a layer 1 DLT network. Usually the triangle discussion goes around decentralization - scalability - security but your point introduced a whole new dimension...Maybe you can help understand Reddit why BTC is the N1 treasury asset of choice of the smartest people in our blockchain ecosystem. Even fraudsters like Do Kwon for example. Why didn't he buy ETH or USDT to stick it up his butt while he was backpacking through Montenegro on the way to Dubai? This is a very important example. It is not a coincidence. Do you agree?..TLDR; btc is robust money, gold. Eth is flexible money, oil. Both have their use case but don't measure btc in gallons or eth with a metal tester. Be smart.
5
That's not what the stats show, bitcoin transaction volume is still consistently growing. Monero, while growing, has definitely not replaced bitcoin anywhere. Market regulations hate monero, and that's not likely to ever change, so most people buying monero in the first place are going to have to buy bitcoin to get it...Bitcoin is very effective at what it does, and it's the most likely of all the cryptos to sustain its price in the future. I agree that speculation has pumped up bitcoin a lot, but the number doesn't really matter, once bitcoins price is established that's what people will pay for it because demand is constant due to its functionality as a currency. I expect we will see multiple 2-3x drops in price like we have many times due to speculation, but it'll have constant upward momentum, in 10 years no way its lower than it is now
2
You’re right, eth is obviously the answer lol 😂🤮
-2
This conversation is as clear as Vitalik explaining what ethereum is.
6
Cheers!
2
This is the thing. You can just look over a slightly different time frame and get a very different result...Apart from a spurt 4-5 years ago or so, BTC has proven to be the more reliable investment...Stocks and shares are tumbling today, with Crypto-sized movements overnight. I reckon BTC will weather it better than ETH. And that's not me talking it down. I have twice as much ETH as BTC.
3
> So Ethereum works the other way around, so that later buyers are more privileged than early buyers?..Ethereum isn't a Greater Fool scheme because it has positive expected revenue: People pay to use it for something other than hoping someone else will buy it, for example sending each other stablecoins for commerce, running decentralized domains and trading vaguely defined property rights of pictures of monkeys. This is revenue that goes to holders of ETH in the form of transaction fees and MEV revenue...This is different to BTC where the only revenue comes from other investors who are also expecting to make a profit. But mathematically the amount of money coming out of the scheme can only be the amount of money going into the scheme minus the amount spent on mining, a vast amount mostly not even ending up with the miner. This is a massively negative number, so the average investor is mathematically guaranteed to take out less than they put in...On the "smart people choose BTC" theory it seems weird that your go-to example of a smart person is someone who committed an obvious fraud, got caught and decided to hide his assets by stuffing a ledger up his arse when he could have got the same effect by memorizing 12 words.
1
Negative. I am not knowledgeable enough about eth to make an accurate statement as to whether it is overvalued or what the average investor sentiment is. Hence why I only expressed my views on Bitcoin...Don't fall for a dichotomy. They could both be bad investments, or eth could be undervalued, I don't know...Although I do admit saying "the opposite" in my original message makes it sound like eth is the better choice. I regret saying that now.
0
Fair comparison but you need to break it down for me further...Btc also has transaction fees (and block rewards) which pays miners for their hash rate (processing power) with a robust monetary policy (immutable). ..Ethereum has transaction fees, block rewards and MEV, yes. However, the monetary policy is a bit more flexible. 40%+ of validators are OFAC compliant and censorship attack vector is much higher than any other network atm. The ETH community will do anything to appeal to institutional buyers...The criminal shmuck used btc because there is no way in theory that the assets can get frozen. This is not the case with any other L1 or L2, given the will and push is strong enough to enforce an Improvement Proposal (a bit more difficult with btc)...Currently, at this point in time, btc is the clear objectively better asset. But we do not know what will happen in 100 years.
2
The transaction fees in BTC don't go to BTC holders, they go to a different group, miners, who have to spent most of them on electricity bills. Regardless of whether you think that's a good system, the fees aren't revenue for BTC holders...Ethereum is like a toll road where people are driving on the road to get places for various purposes and the tolls go to the shareholders. Bitcoin is like a toll road where all the fees are collected by the toll booth operators and none go the the investors. In addition new shares are constantly issued to pay toll booth operators. And since it failed to scale for payments, the only people using the road and paying the tolls are investors...
2
With btc you get a free censorship resistant digital bank account for eternity. Yes, you don't get any more perks, that's it...With eth, you get a smart digital payment system which rewards you if you lock up your eth. And you get fees after the validators take their cut. But are validators really better than miners? Let's discuss:.Btc miner:.- plug in any hamster pc with a CPU and internet connection and the best hashrate relative to energy consumption works ..Eth validator:.- rent a high performance CPU+RAM+99,9% uptime, ideally in a data center from AWS/Google cloud/Hetzner etc or buy your own node for 2k. ..Imagine what will happen when those big 3 data centers say that all nodes have to comply with KYC of validator businesses. Do you think validators will say no because the user's right to an open financial network is not a compromise?
1
What you're talking about now is unrelated to whether the average investor will lose money but:..> Btc miner: - plug in any hamster pc with a CPU and internet connection and the best hashrate relative to energy consumption works ..This will definitely lose you money. To mine profitably you need an ASIC...> Eth validator: - rent a high performance CPU+RAM+99,9% uptime, ideally in a data center from AWS/Google cloud/Hetzner etc or buy your own node for 2k. ..I run a validator, it's just a normal low-cost PC sitting on a shelf with a big SSD drive plugged in. You don't need 99.9% uptime or anything like that, whoever has been telling you all this shit you should stop listening to them.

It could eat up gas intentionally, and there are libs to help limit that. It could renter your contract (so all the risks there). It can take msg.value without delivering.

That depends on many things, what contract is called? What is in payload? Etc. show code snippet if you want more help

If the called contract is malicious or faulty, it could potentially drain your contract’s funds, execute unwanted code, or cause other issues. lways ensure you’re interacting with trusted contracts and consider adding checks or safety measures to mitigate potential risks.

Poorly configured..HTTPS works... https://weth.io/
2
Didn’t realise they had a website but does it matter?..The weth contract is an immutable token contract with really simple code. Deposit eth, mint weth; call withdraw, burn weth, return eth...Its sole purpose is to enable smart contract interactions for eth for defi...It’ll never depeg and is in fact over-collateralised now since people have accidentally sent weth to the contract itself… which are unretrievable due to its immutability and the lack of any such functions.
2
Can you explain why we need a wrapped Version of eth?
2
> is in fact over-collateralised now since people have accidentally sent weth to the contract itself… which are unretrievable...So is it really over-collateralized, since these "surplus" are lost forever?.I'm just being picky ^^ it's 100% collateralized, that's all we need.
1
ETH is the native token of the Ethereum Blockchain. ...Other tokens circulating on Ethereum are ERC-20 tokens, a specific standard made to create fongible tokens....Technically speaking, ETH and other tokens on ethereum (ERC-20) are completely different. DeFi mostly uses ERC-20 tokens and ETH is not natively compatible with it, because of its very different nature*....So in order to "manipulate" ETH in DeFi (for example in a liquidity pool), DeFi protocols need an ERC-20 token. wETH is just an ERC-20 token that is pegged 1:1 with ETH........\* to be more specific: all tokens you see on Ethereum (excluding ETH, which I would rather call a "coin" or a "native token") are just smart contracts. For each token, a smart contract keeps a record of all transactions and holder balances.
3
A big use case for it is that you can bid on NFTs with it, that’s why many people I know use it
1
A lot of smart contract functionality can't work without ERC-20 or some other programatic token. The "wrapped" paradigm was used because it was supposed to make it more intuitive for end users, but i've always felt that there were better analogies they could have used.
1
Yeah, they’re lost forever.
2
To add on, it’s not exactly a peg in the traditional sense. It’s a programme on the blockchain where anyone can call it and it gives you the exact amount of WETH for any amount of ETH you deposit. It also works vice-versa. There’s no owner, no admin, no way to censor or modify or block it unless the entire chain crashes. ..It’s slightly different to wBTC and other “pegged” token as it’s not dependable on any centralised authority. In fact, WETH is quite unique in this design. This design is also shared with other gas tokens like WMATIC.

Title: Are L2s parasitic?
8
L1 has its limit. It is not computational limit like Bons thinks. Almost all ETH node/validator can handle many times the current throughput without any problem. It is a data growth rate limit, to maintain a reasonable cost to run a full history node, and for light nodes to keep a long enough history to prevent long range attack...Ethereum at maximum capacity grows about 500GB per year. You can argue we should increase it to 1TB, but that is only a 2x. You can also argue 500GB is already too much. Regardless of 500GB/yr is reasonable or not, the point is L1 has a limit, caused by storage, so those computational tricks like sharding, parallel computing won't solve it. Therefore L2 is the only way. It is not that we like L2, we don't have other choice. And the fragmenting problem is solvable. I'm pretty sure it is one of the top priority on the current roadmap...Solana at maximum capacity requires 4PB per year. A 2TB SSD cost $100-150. If Solana is running at maximum capacity, to run a full history node, you need to spend at least $200k on storage every year. Of course they don't run it at maximum capacity. So every blockchain has this same problem. If you want to store transaction on L1, it's gonna take space. We either restrict L1 data growth, which makes L2 the only solution, or we ask full nodes to spend hundred thousands on SSD.
36
Its just a narrative spun by VCs. The most profitable thing for them historically was to invest in new L1s...The new L1s dont have a path to real scaling. They pump up hardware requirements to look like they scale right now but its clear that that wont suffice in the long term...But the VCs dont care about the long term. They want to sell you their tokens right now. And the pitch is that their beefed up chains are better because they are composable fast and cheap. ..L2s are also fast and cheap. But not yet composable. Composability isnt a huge issue currently (alt L1s also dont compose) and there are multiple ways to address this...Once the fragmentation is solved VCs will move the goalpost again. Just as they have done multiple times in the past...Investing in a new L1 can bring in massive amounts of money, 10s of billions. That makes it worth spending massive amounts on marketing and misinformation. You really need to dig deep and understand the fundamentals nowadays.
21
The fragmentation of the ecosystem should mostly be a temporary phenomenon. Because all rollups finalize based on the same L1, it should be possible to bridge very efficiently, and if you know that a transaction has gone through on Chain X, you should also be able to know that it's gone through on Chain Y. This is different to what happens across L1s, because there's always the possibility that one of the L1s will reorg while the other won't and what you thought would happen on one of the chains would turn out not to happen, so transactions across L1s will always involve friction...There are some changes necessary to make this happen smoothly: We need bridges like LXLY that the Polygon zkEVM team are working on, and changes to addresses and wallets so that you can send from an address on one L2 to another (or to the L1) almost as simply as you can on the same L1. But this stuff is happening, it's a matter of getting it done and adopted rather than a fundamental unsolved technical problem...The other thing they talk about is the collapse in L1 fee revenue, but this is just another way of saying that we've created loads of spare capacity, which is what we want. The experience of blockchains to date is that when something has a decent network effect the market will fill up as much capacity as we can provide, so I wouldn't worry that we'll run out of scaling problems and the L1 fees will stay crazy low. It's much better to scale with huge capacity and low fees (high volume, low unit cost) than the opposite: Firstly because there's the risk that someone else will out-compete you, and secondly because the point of the exercise is to create freedom for people, and the more transactions we have the more freedom we're creating.
10
1/ correct, but processing a transaction only needs to know if you can afford it or not, like when you use your credit card… it does not need to access the entire bank server to see what you did or owned 30 years ago to see if you can buy 1L of milk right now...Thereby you can prune the data and have light nodes or “smaller nodes”..When using the book terminology the Ethereum node tells the story page by page and no chopping up a book would not make sense if you want to read the story page by page, block by block...But if you want to access all data about 1 character quickly… it makes a lot of sense to store all pages or notes about every character in the same box. ..The archive nodes store ALL data.
2
For every L2 transaction there is a L1 Ethereum fee paid...That fee burns to keep the supply which is paid for staker nodes. The supply and demand between the two determine inflation rate...Every L2 transaction burns L1 ether supply. It scales...Bons is a Bitcoin and Ethereum hater in favour of his own invested VC funded public chains.
2
It's just another problem that has to be solved eventually - like through zk-sync elastic chain systwm or aoutomated bridging in wallet software
1
When you transfer tokens through L2 like OPchain,  gas fees are still paid in ETH rather than its own L2 token (OP). Which maintains compatibility with the Eth net and ensures consistent security. Same as Arbitrum, also require ETH for gas fees
1
No they are not. Fee revenue is not where the value comes from of having L2s but L2s using Eth as a source of liquidity and as payment method it locks up Eth. Eth being money on L2s is what ultimately makes L2s non parasitic. There is 10s of millions of Eth on L2s. The more people use the ecosystem and use Eth for liquidity the better for Eth.
1
Ask yourself.. parasitic to whom?  The great thing about l2 is it gives people who haven’t lived and breathed crypto for the past 15 years  fair opportunity and entry price of a newer asset.  Just my 2c.  Perhaps the long term BTC and ETH holders who expect everyone to line up to pump their bags are the true parasites.
1
I think there will be a coalescing around a singular l2 in a handful of years. ..If someone wants to start a competing platform it’s better for everyone if it’s a l2 instead of a whole new blockchain.
0
What happens when everything moves to Bitcoin via Taproot Assets on the Lightning Network?
0
They are bandaids for an L1 that is inherently flawed
-4
There is no counter argument, they are.
-7
An effective network should have the ability for nodes to validate transactions without storing the entire ledger. XRP (no real smart contracts) can do so through a pruned ledger which has just each address' final transaction. I'm not sure if any EVMs have managed it.
2
This is not a binary choice, you could increase capacity at the speed of storage getting cheaper and larger, and possibly storage technology growth is faster. Hardware is never a problem when there is motivation, as you can see in crazy upgrading of bitcoin ASIC mining chips. ..Now that each staking validator value is getting close to 100K USD, their owner will never mind adding a few TB per year
1
Just to remind that working on L2 shall not prevent improving L1 incrementally. It’s like running a business, short term revenue is needed to keep business running. 2X is still significant to keep competitors at bay
1
And no l2s are not parasitic. They scale ethereum and strengthen ETH as dominant currency of the onchain economy.
11
L1 can not scale directly to 1000x, but they don't need to either, they just need to keep up with the growth of storage tech, which is already quite fast anyway, almost double each year. On the other hand, L2 is a short sighted choice, created to just cope with today's hardware, do not consider the growth in hardware tech..The fragmentation problem also exists in bitcoin's L2, so called routing, and after 10 years it still has no solution, that is why lightning network still get very few real users. I just wonder how ethereum could solve this fundamental problem
-1
Yes the bridging part is the key reason for fragmentation. How is it going to be solved? Bitcoin's LN has tried this for 10 years but still a failure, does ethereum have something better? ..Another concern mentioned by the article is the risk of split. I remember that many coins today are started as ERC20 tokens, running on ETH mainnet and they pay ETH fees. But when their community and usage has gotten large enough, they break from ethereum and make their own blockchain, became a competing chain. What will prevent L2s going the same route?
1
Different L2s will be created to target different usecases and feature sets.
3
If a single L2 can handle everything then why can't an L1, and then why do you need L2s?
1
Just like L2s, it's trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It will offer more features, but a platform like Ethereum will definitely be much better b/c it was built for such features.
2
The thing you end up needing there is the state database. If all your chain does is payments then the state database consists of balances for each account. If it does arbitrary storage like Ethereum then it also includes the storage of each contract...Ethereum clients absolutely can prune the data they store down to the state database and not much else. But this part is the thing that's preventing us from scaling Ethereum faster. They also usually store the blockchain of transactions, which they could throw that away but it can live on cheap slow storage so it's not really worth getting rid of.
7
Hardware isn't a problem for stakers, although the network speed might be if they want to stake at home as there's often a limit to how fast a connection you can buy. It's a problem for people who want to run their own validating nodes, who aren't usually stakers...The counter-argument is that it seems like hardly anybody actually wants to do that even if you can make the hardware requirements really low. And if we move everybody's data to L2s then even fewer people will want to run L1 nodes; The main reason to run an L1 node is to get RPC access, but there's no point in having RPC access to a chain you never directly use.
1
In Ethereum we believe that demand for blockspace will be so large that a single computer can not handle it. Therefore there is no other way than L2...But lets say youre right and there will be so little demand that we just need to wait for hardware to get cheap enough. Guess what Ethereum also scales with hardware getting better. So that isn't really an argument...Fragmentation on Bitcoin lightning is completely different. Every single user is its own L2 and needs to make L1 tx to open and settle channels. On Ethereum you never need to touch L1 as a user. Routing problem doesn't exist on Ethereum L2s.
5
> Bitcoin's LN has tried this for 10 years but still a failure, does ethereum have something better?..Everything about Bitcoin's LN is a failure. For Ethereum bridging designs, for example see https://polygon.technology/agglayer..> I remember that many coins today are started as ERC20 tokens, running on ETH mainnet and they pay ETH fees. But when their community and usage has gotten large enough, they break from ethereum and make their own blockchain, became a competing chain...Which coins? There were projects that were always intended to be their own chains and did their initial ICO on Ethereum but I can't think of a lot of examples of a regular token that moved onto its own chain. Generally if your chain is handling assets that are bridged trustlessly across L1 and lots of different L2s you're not going to want to give that up unless the L1 fees get really bananas, and the whole substance of the rest of this criticism is that L1 fees will be tiny. Bridging between L1s doesn't work like L1-L2 or L2-(same L1)-L2 does, for the reasons I've given.
2
I think there are good reasons, but Other chains have l2 functionality baked in.

It just feels like sometimes the conversation in here chases it's own tail. Like, I'm trying to follow what you're saying, and am, but it seemingly either leads into itself or into oblivion. ..Correct, please, if misinterpreted:..1/ It's a record, right? That's it, data, stored to look at later? That's all this is at the end point conceptual level. So, I'm not seeing how you can ever have a book longer than the book is...2/ If you chop the book up, it's still there.This is actually worse usually, because now you need overhead to reassemble it, and to store the chunks, now that they're out of the book. That was the entire point of the book, to have it unchopped, together, a record, not parts of...3/ If you copy the book, so you don't have to go get the one copy everytime, you're going to desync as soon as you stop writing and take the book to the new location. Again, #2 can occur here, with the same non-effect entropic loss...4/ If you make the book into a series of many books, not only do you still have #3, but this is more like #2 on steroids...you chop up the idea of a book, and only print a chapter into a single book. Ooof, systemically, totally, again, no gain, much entropy. But worse, now that you've weakened the original concept here, it no longer even achieves it's primary goal: keeping the whole record! Thus, someone can just say "this is the book" or "this is a series of books", and it's more effort than we had back in #1!..If we know the rules of books, conceptually, then no matter how long you talk, or what electricity beams around where (also not free energy from the aether), or what combination of those two: If you want a record, you have to keep it. If you want to prove to someone that you haven't altered it, you need another copy somewhere else that you can prove you can't have altered, (a negative, oof, tough) or prove is unalterable at all, an impossibility. ...Note: A lot of this is bulk trust in security of computers, literal rocks that do exactly what they are told without any ability to discern if it's good or bad. This is the least secure process in the Universe, ahem.

Same here, network speed is also improving for everyone year over year. Staking nodes network throughput is currently running around 5Mbps, 50Mbps when a block is arriving. Most of the residence fiberlan infrastructure is around 1Gbps even 10 years ago, and business network is already going at 10Gbps fiber lan
1
It is very similar for bitcoin's LN since the beginning: A bunch of LN operators were like today's different L2s for ETH. They were typically exchanges/wallets, struggling to onboard users to their platform, even today, they are still trying..L2s in essential is a prepaid card. You charge the card and use the card in a specific area, when you finished, you get your money back..This clearing model from bank has been existing for decades and you can see the same practice applied in food court / transport and even telecom since the beginning of this century. But today, you barely see this anymore, there is a reason to it: The fragmentation in user experience and management eventually caused many project to drop this model
1
We have done extensive research 10 years ago about L2 and think that is a dead end, that is why we went to ETH who promised L1 scaling with sharding. But now ETH also turns to this route and so far I have not seen convincing evidence that ETH L2s are any better fundamentally..Any kinds of L2 is essentially a prepaid card. You charge the card and use the card with a specific merchant, when you are done, you withdraw your money back..This clearing model existed for decades and are applied in food court / transport and even telecom since the beginning of this century. But they mostly get abandoned later on, due to bad user experience and complex in management..So I'm curious, what makes ETH L2s think they would be any different in avoiding this sure way to failure? There could be new technology breakthroughs, but first they have to solve this bad user experience and complex management problem..Let's talk a very simple usecase: I want to send 1 ETH to coinbase and exchange it for BTC, how could their L2 base chain handle this?
1
If you have multiple books and one of them just has short summaries/readers digest versions of the other books, that main book is much shorter. And different people can be responsible for storing/editing the specialized books..Any reader potentially is only interested in a specialized book or the main book plus one or two of the others.
4
> 2/ If you chop the book up, it's still there.This is actually worse usually, because now you need overhead to reassemble it, and to store the chunks, now that they're out of the book. That was the entire point of the book, to have it unchopped, together, a record, not parts of...Think about what all these different people want to keep their own copies of this data for. The goal of each node keeping their own record is that they can:.. * Check that transactions they care about are valid, eg if you send me ETH I want to know that I really got them. * Check that all the transactions on the chains I care about are valid. This is necessary for the previous point, because if there's an invalid transaction in the chain then that version of the whole chain is invalid. * Be able to read the state of any chain with transactions I care about so I don't have to rely on somebody else's RPC node which might lie to me when I'm trying to transact..The great thing about zk-rollups is that you don't need the whole zk-rollup to know that the transactions on it are valid. This is proved by the much smaller amount of data that's posted to L1. So to get all the guarantees I mentioned, I need to run an L1 node, and a node of each L2 I care about (for the RPC endpoint) and none of the other hundreds of L2s that I don't care about. This is potentially a massive difference, because people want to do things like gaming chains that will create massive amounts of data that most people won't care about unless they're sent an asset from that chain, which they can see and check without running the chain...If you're prepared to weaken the third requirement and say that somebody else can send you the data for the L2s instead of you needing to run your own RPC node, provided that you can verify that the data they send you is correct, that reduces your need even further to just the L1 block headers and state plus a little bit of extra software.
2
> Let's talk a very simple usecase: I want to send 1 ETH to coinbase and exchange it for BTC, how could their L2 base chain handle this?..Sorry, I don't understand why BTC is involved? Doing anything across chains involving BTC will be ugly because BTC isn't an L2 of Ethereum, it's a different L1. ..Is the question for these purposes just that you want to send 1 ETH to Coinbase? Your 1 ETH will start on some L2 of Ethereum. If Coinbase supports deposits on this chain then you'll just send it to them on the chain it's on. If Coinbase doesn't support deposits on the chain you're starting on then you'll need to bridge it across to a chain that they support. What should happen in The Future is that they'll give you a deposit address that includes the ID of the chain you're sending to, you'll send it, and it'll be confirmed as of the next L1 block, or the next-but-one L1 block.

"If you have multiple books and one of them just has short summaries/readers digest versions of the other books, that main book is much shorter."..**This is #4, yes.** The spot where you're making an error/magic is happening is "summaries". This doesn't make sense, unfortunately. I don't know what exact assumptions you have, but maybe its that if you had information recorded in the book that you can "summarize" then that information was useless in the first place, i.e. you're pretending to optimize the process by creating the waste in the first place. The data in the record is either needed or it isn't, "summarizing" is "removing unneeded data". This is what I meant by it not mattering how long you can talk, there are rules here that cannot be broken as they are defined as such, so to break them you must be ignorant. In this case, ignoring that "summaries" is a euphemism for "I removed the unneeded data". This is especially clear in the context here, in that there isn't ever any point where any data is unneeded, the whole thing is to write it down and keep it..."And different people"..**This is #2, yes.** Note the immediate overhead multiplication. More people/nodes/instances are great, if the system is net-positive/working, but we are explicitly talking about how it isn't, you see?.."can be responsible for storing/editing the specialized books."..**This is a continuation of the magic of "summarize", with "specialized".** This specialized way of storing data without storing all the data is really only described by a single concept: cryptography, or more layperson in this case as "compression algorithms". These are not magic, and have rules, just like books, not coincidentally as they operate on such exclusively. You can't compress a human being, for example, or a plant. Well, wordgames, but you can't get the information back out, and thats the whole point: to store information in the smallest possible way. The book already helps with that (before you ripped it up into this, which again, note the selfdefeating loop) so we're losing and not gaining. And the gain can't be more than the loss, because we were creating the loss in the first place by storing the data uncompressed at all. There is no escape. If you can compress data, it must not have been at its minimally readable volume. The "trilemma", I think people call it, an illusion whereby you can constantly gain ground and thus appear to be moving closer towards an eventual goal, but the ground crumbles behind you with each step..."Any reader potentially is only interested in a specialized book or the main book plus one or two of the others."..**This is #4, the full circle destruction of the book: it doesn't even exist, only these little parts. If you say "no wait, it does still", then we've looped back to #2, with all the same problems, and now** ***more*** **records to keep around!**
0
All them words are doing nothing though. It's just data. Recorded in a book. There's no way around it. You're creating less efficient processes and then solving them and thinking the relative gain something something now you're more efficient than the ***limit***. It's just not possible. If you don't understand what you just said, no worries, but it's just not really relevant to the point at hand. If someone tells you they have a machine that can work perpetually, you **know** they are confused...Edit: Like, I'm **already talking about the base minimal data case and accounting for perfect duplication and reproduction**. This isn't about that.

Of course I'm depositing from mainnet, where most of the existing ETH holders have their cold storage. You can replace BTC with Solana, Sui, Ton or FET, some of the hot coins this year..My understanding is that for most of the practical uses, L2 does not help. It was the same for bitcoin's LN, those LN operators (exchanges and wallets) were hoping that they could rent-seeking in their own platform, but time has proven that the most common use case is cross-chain exchange or L1 transfer, which LN does not help but just bring more complexity..Yes, like that polygon's solution, I can imagine a future that all ETH transactions are first sent to a contract address, where the contract handle the bridging, but that would break many of today's applications, almost like starting a new chain. There is a risk that new people just skip ETH and goes to another fresh new chain like Solana/Sui etc... because this universal contract and its added complexity (coordinating many different L2s simultaneously) make things look less clear and easy to get security problem
1
I disagree. If we stretch the analogy, there are two key differences:.a) people trust the ETH book to be correct, but not the other books..b) the summaries do not contain the full information, only enough that the editors of the other books cannot forge entries in the specialized books without generating detectable inconsistencies...Result: you have many more books you can trust and thus more space for text without the need to handle one unreasonably big book.
6
> Edit: Like, I'm already talking about the base minimal data case and accounting for perfect duplication and reproduction. This isn't about that...You seem to be assuming that the goal here is for lots of people to keep the complete record of all the data in the system. That's not the goal, nobody is trying to do that. Everybody keeping all the data in the system was the simplest implementation to get the goals we actually wanted, but it doesn't scale.

> Of course I'm depositing from mainnet, where most of the existing ETH holders have their cold storage...I don't think that's an "of course". Generally people are holding their assets wherever they get them...> My understanding is that for most of the practical uses, L2 does not help. It was the same for bitcoin's LN, those LN operators (exchanges and wallets) were hoping that they could rent-seeking in their own platform, but time has proven that the most common use case is cross-chain exchange or L1 transfer, which LN does not help but just bring more complexity..Do you ever actually use Ethereum? Ethereum is not Bitcoin. It's mostly not used for hoarding coins then sending them to a centralized exchange. The proof of this is that after blobs shipped and people were able to use L2, volume on L2s soared, and competition for space on L1 dropped enough that gas fees became really low for a while...> I can imagine a future that all ETH transactions are first sent to a contract address, where the contract handle the bridging, but that would break many of today's applications, almost like starting a new chain...The main issue is that we need a new address standard. But even that is something you can work around; For example, if you want to do "send coins to address X from chain Y to chain Z", you can make a contract on chain Y that will accept the coins and do the rest of the stuff for you, so for the user it still just looks like "send to an address on the chain you're on"...You really can't conclude that this stuff doesn't work just because Bitcoin couldn't make it work. Bitcoin scripting is really primitive. It was Satoshi's first attempt, then a load of stuff got ripped out because it turned out to have security holes. L2 systems are smart contract systems, and Bitcoin support for smart contracts is just not very good. You can't make them work on Bitcoin without making a lot of changes to Bitcoin, and Bitcoin developers don't want to make a lot of changes, this is why Ethereum was created in the first place.
2
To be clear though, the "book" isn't exactly an analogy. If a "digital book" is equivalent to a real book for our purposes, which I was so equating, then it isn't an analogy at all, note...A. That's not "the ETH book" they "trust" over "other books", or rather the data/book itself is not what's being "trusted"...it's just a book. You only know it's "the ETH book" and not "the other" because something you trust ("ETH") ***outside of the book*** tells you so. This doesn't have anything to do with books, and is thus **a additional problem to solve besides having the book**, you must now have "ETH" entities to trust, and their additional books...B. This is again, though, the talking in loops, escaping via layers and losing the start. If you understand how the "summaries" reduce the amount of **meaningful recorded data** then explain it. Otherwise it's false on its face: you can't remove data without removing data. 1000 * 1 is the same as 2 * 500. If it isn't, you lost data. If you use external systems to store that data, you can't pretend they don't exist. If there is one invincible book and only one person can write in it and you trust them then that's the absolute best we got. That's the limit. There is nothing superior to this, eh? ..Result: If the book is "unreasonable" then you made it so, or ETH did, or there isn't any one person to trust. Any other configuration is less efficient, de facto. So "having more space" or "editors" or "more copies of the book" or "copies of parts of the book" can appear to have some kind of illusory benefit, but in reality, man it's just ignoring all this and handwaving of jargon that represent impossible material concepts, such as parts being more than the whole. This exists in the conceptual world, not the physical one, where data lives. Blurring the two is what causes the impossible loop.
-1
Nope. I'm not assuming anything..."Everybody..." is not the "simplest implementation" of keeping data, its having multiple copies of the data, that's more complex already than just having one "book". Things "scale" how they are. If something is X then scaling it is going to be X \* the scaling, unless you have bad data for X already. This is incompetence, not an inefficiency gain, just pointing out the phenomenon.
1
To be clear: not all meaningful data is getting to L1. So yes, you are correct, data would be lost if you remove a L2. But for some things you do not need the full data...The original idea of the blockchain was that you can always download the chain, recalculate all transactions and operations and thereby prove that the chain and all balances are correct...If you can prove that everything is correct without having all the transactions in between, then you get the correct balances, but you don't know anymore who did what to get there. That is meaningful information, but maybe not of interest for your application.
3
I am indeed correct.

No, absolutely no need to buy an Intel NUC. Also if you're not staking then the CPU isn't very important, you can keep up with the chain with a really shitty CPU...The main issue is that wouldn't be satisfied by basically any normal computer you might buy is that you need your SSD drive to be big enough and fast enough. You can get by with 2TB but for future-proofing it's probably better to get 4TB at this point...This page has a good list of SSDs that are known to work well..https://gist.github.com/yorickdowne/f3a3e79a573bf35767cd002cc977b038

Have you guys never heard of nostr?
4
The constant attempts of crypto  bag holders to link their favorite coin to the latest buzz is incredibly predictable and sad. Yesterday it was AI and today it’s Telegram?  ..Constant bandwagon chasing is  not what successful and viable platforms do — the useful ones gain  use cases and adoption organically while the pretenders chase trends and seek to create fake or thin associations to make their own thin look better
5
What? Any sources to back up this claim? And why change to a L2 when they have control over their own network now?
2
There are already a bunch of messaging apps out there. And there were messaging apps before Telegram
1
Will get some hate for this, but there already is an alternative, completely on the block chain. OpenChat..I thought I would hate it, but it's pretty neat..https://oc.app/?ref=clbp2-sqaaa-aaaar-ahheq-cai.. https://x.com/OpenChat?t=bM8ObI70-zy1XE_gXgfhHw&s=09
1
Please, tell.
2
You’re unintelligent to put AI and telegram in the same sentence as if they are equivalent buzzwords
1
Pavel Durov (the founder) was arrested. It's obvious to me by now that messenging/ communication is not safe to be created in plain sight and so we will need a way to safely communicate with each other without fear of imprisonment. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when and how. I personally believe it makes the most sense for a L2 on ETH for this purpose for reasons described ad nauseum.
2
What is Nostr? Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.
3
Why does this need to be onchain? Signal works great. ..For decentralisation there is matrix/element, and xmpp which do not rely on crypto. I think these have metadata leakage however, so Signal or Session provides the most privacy...For built on crypto, there is Session (started as a fork of signal, and is built on crypto, using PoS)
5
Sounds like everything else. What makes this special? Does it do chat like telegram?

Hopefully, you have pulled those off RH and have put your 32ETH into cold storage.  Maybe look into liquidity pools.  No chance of liquidation...can withdraw at any time...collect fees from the pool based on volume and percentage rate...usually better rates than just staking...Keep in mind of impermanent loss, **current value of assets in a liquidity pool is less than their value at the time of deposit**.
10
Lido or Rocket Pool
9
take baby steps to get there:..1) Get a cold storage setup (hardware wallet).2) Learn how to safely store your hardware wallet and seed phrase .3) Transfer funds to your new cold storage setup.4) Swap some of your eth for liquid staking tokens (There are bunch of them, do some research here).5) Congrats you’re now staking and earning yield..6) Now you can start down the solo staking path for more yield: First step is to get a machine running a full eth node (without a validator).7) Once you’re comfortable running this full node, you can deposit 32eth and now you’re securing the network while earning yield 🫡.8) (bonus) Add MEV boost to your node so you can get a larger payout in the event that you get to propose a block

[effacé]

Essentially you can become a chain validator
2
Why u posting how much eth u have 😭
2
You'll need quite a few hours to set up your own node (even when using Stereum and a cloud server), so if you want a quick and easy solution, you can buy a liquid staking token. Mind that this carries some risk, and that it triggers a taxable event when you buy them (and sell again)...Honestly there's no simple solution to safe quickly and safely. Lido is likely your best bet, so you can look into that and see if that fits your profile
1
Thoughts on SSV.Network?
1
Just buy rETH (RocketPool ETH)....It's a decentralized staking protocol. The value of rETH against ETH will go up over time as the Rocket Pool community stakes ETH and earna revenue....Do not trust me, check their website. It's pretty well documented.

What do you mean no chance of liquidation?

Thanks for the advice.  I suppose it goes without saying if I'm asking a "how to stake" question

Sorry, not intended to boast - just hit the key figure of 32 and just want to navigate the safest path to staking!  Took patience and timing to get there!

This is obviously a scam. Don't send them any more money...Your comment was removed by the automod and I'll leave it removed as we prefer not to link to scams, even to say they're scams.

What I mean is if you are out of range, you just won't earn fees during that time.   Compared to doing futures, if you fall out of a certain range (higher or lower the entry price, depending on short or long) your investment into the position can be wiped out entirely.

Moreover with the recent dencun upgrade has made the fees drop [significantly ](https://l2fees.info/)
4
You use Ether (ETH) to pay for transaction fees on all networks. So buy a bit of Eth and send it to your wallet. You can then bridge Eth to the Layer-2 networks to pay for fees on those networks as well...A transaction on Ethereum mainnet cost about a dollar to send, to bridge to layer 2 cost perhaps 5 dollars...A transaction on L2 is 0.01 Usd, and bridge from L2 to another L2 is 0.1 or something.

Literally all you have to do is google crypto developer activity.....I like https://www.developerreport.com..Edit: also, I think the problem with some crypto spectators is they view ethereum in a silo, when they should really be looking at the development surrounding the entire EVM (ethereum virtual machine).

How strong dose of ETH hopium you need?
6
and let's not forget eth/btc ratio has been going down, steadily, for more than 2 years. One delivers a whole ecosystem (granted - still to be properly seized), and the other is barely a currency.or store of value. Maybe it's just Solana being hyped, but I wish I had a clear explanation. Sometimes it crosses my mind that crypto is not very rational...
4
Short term price hopium: It has been about a month since the ETFs went live. When BTC ETFs went live, the BTC price dipped, recovered a month after launch, then went up 61% the next month.
5
"Tanking" lol. You could not *possibly* have held for a whole year yet.
4
Applications like Farcaster are built on Ethereum and do not require any technical knowledge
3
It’s up over 12% YTD. Past 4 months is a very short time window as an investor. You should be looking at a multiple years long span, unless you’re just gambling.
3
Lmao, don't worry etherium isn't going anywhere. Eventually it will be upgraded anyways, eth is huge. Buy more.
3
Fwiw, I was talking to a contractor who specializes in blockchain recently and he was telling me that the prices can often move in four year cycles. So, there was a major bull run with crypto in 2013, 2017, 2021, and 2021+4 = 2025 -- you get the picture. I'm setting aside a bit of money every week to buy Ethereum. Not so much that it will ruin me if i lose that money, but enough to where I stand to see a substantial gain in the next bull run. The way I see it, Ethereum is on sale right now, and it's especially undervalued compared to Bitcoin (which is a lot closer to its ATH than Ethereum is, percentage wise)
3
It’s not “tanking” it’s correcting
4
Fomo in when btc hit all time high huh?
2
ETH is up like nearly 50% still, was over 100%. You are just buying when there is hype, opposite of what you need to do. If you have conviction in crypto technology, you should be buying when you can. If you're a short term trader, you have a 1% chance of making money
2
The longer the accumulation, HIGHER the slingshot up
2
The only chart you need to understand what’s going on is ETHBTC.
2
well here is a bit of my own "Hopium", The next major upgrade for Ethereum is called *Pectra*. It should speed up transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain Layer 1 and make it even more cheaper operated on.
2
Patience
2
I personally didn’t invest in eth but i read that eth has the potential to hit 10,000 in the future. The coins i have invested in, states that it won’t hit even the dollar! So you are in better shape than i am
2
The price can be up and down, but the number of developers and projects building on Ethereum is a great sign of its long-term potential

I think there are some serious concerns among investors, L2s might totally destory ETH. Just have a look at the following article and see if you agree with those concerns:.https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-dying-l2-dance-on-grave-ceo/..Previously, many coins are started as ERC20 token, but when they get mature and robust, they typically took the community away and issue their own coin on their own blockchain. L2 is actually another blockchain, only slightly commited to L1, this makes such switch even easier
1
Eth is in a load zone. BTC almost always dips around august/september after a halving and doesn’t gain momentum until closer to a US election. Eth follows btc price wise. If BTC dumps past like 40k then maybe things change
1
No, ethereum is dog shit. You're going to get rugged by vitalik and his cronies.

Thanks for your replies guys (some were helpful, some were not)...It's great to see that still Ethereum has the most amount of developers building applications on the Ethereum Blockchain more than other Blockchain out there. ..However, to be honested I couldn't name a single one of these applications that are being built or what their use cases will actually bring to the table. ..This is my concern with Ethereum, it's all well and good being an open-source decentralized platform, "BUT" who and what is actually being built on the Ethereum Blockchain??? ..Trading CryptoKittens and NFT's isn't exactly solving real-world problems...When are we going to see the every day public using applications running on the Ethereum Blockchain?? ..Thanks.

It's over. Swap to Bitcoin.

ETH ain't going nowhere and I hold tiny amount of eth for L2 airdrops and meme coins. Hope is terrible place to be for investor, don't over analyse shit it's crypto, sentiment and narratives derive price action, follow narratives and be fast jumping on/off the train as it slows down. There's alot of competition in L1 space atm and ETH foundation chose their path and gas fees is indication of what users think. CHART has all the data you could ever ask and more, everything else is noise and bs
1
I’ll put it this way. Tell me one good use case or an app which is running on ethereum beyond USDT (stablecoins). Which are basically digital USD...Ethereum doesn’t solve anything, and even the stablecoins make no sense becuase they are still a fist currency and fintechs can do the same...The inly use case is specualation on eth and shit tokens on it. In the ling run everything gets correctly priced. In this case ETH to low 3 digit number, if even that.

Ethereum is gonna dip a lot more. 1,750ish. Buy and hold and wait for the rebound. The more it crashes the more u buy.

Bro, I hate to break it to you but things aren't getting better...The Ethereum subreddit has over 3.2M "readers" but half the front page are single-digit numbers of upvotes.  How sad is that?..Blockchain has had 15 years to come up with a use-case where it's uniquely good, and has failed miserably.  All the tech people compare blockchain to, never had that problem.  AI immediately provides material utility better than existing tech solutions in many industries.  Blockchain has tried and failed in everything from NFTs and art to authenticity/supply chain tracking/etc.  It doesn't do anything better.  It's slow.  It's inefficient.  It introduces a ton of additional problems and liabilities existing centralized tech doesn't have to deal with...It was a nice concept to dream about, but at the end of the day, there's nothing there...Even attempts to make crypto legal tender, like in El Salvador, have failed...Even attempts to hook blockchain into traditional finance via ETFs has failed...Get out while you can.  It was always a sinking ship.  Does it have to totally sink before you get it?   Downvoting me isn't going to change this.

Can only speak for myself but I cannot stand ether. It's too expensive to operate on and I'm not really Keen of having to have eth as gas needed to move any erc20 token. But mainly I avoid this coin like the plague because it's too expensive of an ecosystem to be in. Seems like it's for the elite. The chart is no good especially the BTC pair it's horrific. Some say it's at the bottom but it's so weak you're only going to get a relief rally at best my guess. All that ether to 10K from last Bull run they got it wrong. I would not hold for these reasons

Ethereum is NOT and investment. ..Again, ethereum is NOT an investment. ..This was made very clear in the last few years as it has changed. It has an intentional devaluation mechanism to keep it from growing in value per coin, unlike Bitcoin. ..Stop using ethereum to make money.

Sell if you feel like it, you shouldn’t need “hopium”. If you do, you clearly lack a fundamental understanding of what’s being built, at which point I wonder why you bought in the first place...Most Ethereum holders aren’t interested in convincing anyone to buy. Just do whatever you want. If you want desperate hopium, go hop on the Solana “crypto bro” meme train.
81
I hope you're right...The tech has potential but here's what I think.. too many people burnt by especially scams, malware, etc because they don't know any better (and I don't really blame them), the tech is also just far too technical and confusing to use for the average layperson. I mean like you have to have a background in finance, economics, accounting to understand aspects of it, and at the same time tech savvy enough to not get scammed or tricked into leaking phrases or just in general thinking it's not important and losing access to your wallet...I've been dabbling in this and yet I still don't understand what was posted on here like 90% of the time ..The hype has died down but I hope this gives way to actual uses without all the hoopla and noise. Might translate to a lower but more stable price (? I have no idea what I'm talking about)
12
For sure, im definalty in ETH for tyhe long term, however Ethereum L2 just take the work load off of the main Ethereum Blockchain. Thats about all i know about them.
3
The dirty secret is the vast majority of those new Base wallets are bots. They're funded with less than $<0.01 and do a bunch of very very tiny transactions, because Dexscreener's trending algorithm uses number of unique addresses. You don't have to take my word for it, just open the block explorer and find the first swap you can and almost certainly you'll see a bot. Here's an example..https://basescan.org/address/0xaeddf57e7a7e782270d1a67aa38f38695808f324

Yes, but like I'm saying to everyone, can you please name me a single application/project that is currently being built on the Ethereum Blockchain that is acutally going to have real world implications and use cases...Just trading pics of cats and NFTs is not achieving anything.

So why didn't he "Rug" pull us all years ago when the price was much much higher????

As long as people keep making money in crypto, it's going to stick around.

Ethereum is 9 years old.  ...World Wide Web is also 9 years old when Paul Krugman wrote "By 2005, it would become clear that the Internet's effect on the economy is no greater than the fax machine's."..I think we have time. But I think things need a shake up to where people stop giving the hype and saying it will make them rich and start seeing it as the infrastructure of the future.  ...>Blockchain has had 15 years to come up with a use-case where it's uniquely good, and has failed miserably. All the tech people compare blockchain to, never had that problem. AI immediately provides material utility better than existing tech solutions in many industries. Blockchain has tried and failed in everything from NFTs and art to authenticity/supply chain tracking/etc. It doesn't do anything better. It's slow. It's inefficient. It introduces a ton of additional problems and liabilities existing centralized tech doesn't have to deal with...AI is a different area of tech, there is no reason why the two would not compliment one another. Centralized tech has its own set of problems.

Now I start dreaming what Sony could do with a very cheap blockchain that they control with their vast product portfolio...They have game development and a game platform (playstation). They might use this to trade in game items. In game currencies...They have camera hardware, maybe they could build something for copyright handling or a way to sell a picture (a la NFT) or time stamping or some kind of authenticity proof...I’m sure there are tons of opportunities.

I love how “ETH price action” seems to measure the success of the project in most people’s minds. Last time I checked ETH is a GAS TOKEN...Your biggest position on ETH could be wBTC and you can still get all the DeFi benefits of Ethereum with minimal exposure to ETH.
1
Does it use eth or native token?
1
Tbh, I'm a software engineer and still confused how much GAS to put when I sent some tokens. I still don't know how to calculate
3
The price isn't dropping because of scams, malware etc. That makes up a very low % of cases which you see in the headlines. The real reason is that the EF keeps dumping on us, ICO's dump on us and so forth.

Which could be called scailing/capacity since usage is also at ATH  but L2s work.
3
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHBTC..It's been better I guess, ATH was end of 2021, it's now around mid-2021 levels which were an ATH at that point...So yeah, if you bought May 2021-June 2023, you're better off if you'd have bought BTC. Hindsight is always 20/20 in crypto, but I also don't think that means it won't have another big jump against BTC like it did in 2021.
6
That's literally just how the cycle works. Money always flows back into bitcoin when the market is going sideways or down.

At this point in both of the previous 2 cycles, Eth/BTC was substantially lower.

Im not trying to troll im just being honest. I hit a nerve, and I get it. It's ok to feel unsure about what you're holding. The facts still remain. ..Take a second to think. ETH still is a 💩coin (in the nicest way possible). How many have survived against Bitcoin over the past 15 years?? They come and go. The entire market still moves when Bitcoin does. ..Even down to the ETF, are retail really going to invest in ETH? Retail hardly knows what Bitcoin is. Try explaining ETH to your Mum. 😅..What im saying is ETH is still here, but how long for? Could you of been stacking Bitcoin this whole time? ..It's a gamble at this point. I hope to see you all here in 10 years.

No that doesn't matter at all because when I need to sell for profit there's a frenzy going on and gas is ridiculous. So yeah it's a very bad chart and the fees should be low accordingly. But if it ever were to Moon the network is congested and the fees are ridiculous and that's when we need it the most

The testnet just went live the other day...The ones you mentioned are so called “launch partners”, listed at the bottom of the page. But at the very top, it clearly states: “Ethereum layer 2” (without mentioning those other “launch partners”). ..It’s one of the first things you see once you land on the website. Aside from that, I've become kinda numb to the term "partnership" in this space, it's a marketing term more than anything. "Ethereum layer 2" on the other hand, that's the real deal.

No.  The reason is all of crypto is falling, more or less in line.  If ETH has slightly underperformed, it's because few people understand its value.  It's complex and doesn't fit into a simple narrative, which still drives crypto valuations...The EF "dumping" is irrelevant.
9
The Ethereum Foundation owns 0.2% of the total supply of ETH. Their "dumping" is not moving the price...https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae..If you want to create some FUD, be more creative.

You are misunderstanding I think. The ETH supply is deflationary. The exchange rate of a deflationary currency should increase relative to the stable currency it is exchanged for, in a vacuum at least.

Metaphorically, think of Ethereum as the microsoft windows of decentralized finance because it is. You might think windows is a pos (which it is not with win 11). Eth is the go to blockchain for this use case and speaks to its financial potential. Besides when you explain Ethereum this way - an "operating system" -offering essential services upon which defi apps sit they start to understand it conceptually.
5
Of course, but I just meant the top of what has taken place so far. I'm not saying eth has already got to its highest point ever, and will never return there. I don't believe that.
1
That's great, but you shouldn't have had to try very hard in your search, it should have been at the very top of the Google search. ..I'm sorry but these are not good signs, the average person by now should also be talking about Ethereum or have half of an idea of what it is and what it offers. ..Unfortunately some big is going to have to occur, whether that be a major war or a major economic crash in order to get people to start investing into different assets.

Yeah I’m amazed at how people who have no understanding of things on this sub feel the need to so brazenly post about things and expose their complete misunderstanding of basic financial concepts…haters gonna hate I guess
2
That's it's an Ethereum layer 2, full stop. Anything else is just air. Maybe not LINK, since it's a powerful Oracle, and will most likely be deployed on Soneium...The term "partner" is a marketing term more than anything in this space.
6
Yeah, my explaination to people who wanted to know is something like that. It's like an OS, but not really, it's like a database, but not really, it's like money, but not really... (etc etc) so it's still a bit overly complex, plus that would be putting it like a centralized system...To the best of my own understanding I usually explain it like a constantly evolving, self-healing, database / monetary system running over the internet that everyone can access into and develop their own financial and systems out of.
2
I agree with you. In my other post, I wrote about this. The whole thing feels very technical and is out of the understanding of most people, and those who do want to talk to me about it just end up with more questions than they began with...The upside of this is that this is exactly the same with the Internet when it started out. I have been through the whole process - getting a internet connection, setting it up (and not understanding it), going through the pains of dial up and getting disconnected everytime someone picks up the phone, slow download speeds, high bandwidth usage costs, weird 'dot com' businesses and money making plans (who remembers the pixel advertising and other forms of weird and wonderful - mostly werid - way to try to monetize the internet), and of course the dot com bubbles. So the people who look into to try to understand it or get it working now, are the people who will having a much better understanding of it tomorrow, while the people who pish posh it are like the very people who feel left behind and unable to understand the internet today.

Let's hope so. ..For example, it's still amazing that people leave their Crypto on a centralized exchange...After what happened to FTX, Celsius, BlockFi in 2022. ..People still don't learn? They still just can't keep a bit of paper with their seed words written down in a safe place. ..I'm still long term bullish on Ethereum simply because they were first to market, they successfully executed many upgrades and they have the most amount of developers. ..But man, these developers have really go to come out with something really big on the Ethereum Blockchain soon.
1
Unsender, let me ask you a 2 questions and please answer them without looking anything up...If a currency is reducing over time in the amount available, is that currency inflationary or deflationary?..Based on your answer to the first question, does the currency increase in value over time or decrease in value over time (assuming no other factors at play)?
1
I don't own any LINK, and don't plan on buying any. But I certainly understand its usefulness.
4
I've tried that - not convincing, given it's volatility, it gives them more questions / cynicisms.
1
"They still just can't keep a bit of paper with their seed words written down in a safe place."..For most people, this is a scary thought. They can't trust themselves to do anything let alone keep their fortunes on a piece of paper that they will readily forget and throw away. It's like putting your hard earned money in the pillows and the thought of one day it being eaten by termites or something...I think they have had "OK" experience with the usual centralized services to keep their valuables safe (ie banks). It's not great but it works for the most part (until it doesn't work)...Self custoridal is a great concept, but I think there is room for improvement to make it more foolproof.
1
>If a currency is reducing over time in the amount available, is that currency inflationary or deflationary?..It's not that simple. Cryptocurrency isn't the same as currency issued by a state, aka Fiat currency. ..>Based on your answer to the first question, does the currency increase in value over time or decrease in value over time (assuming no other factors at play)?..Not that simple. Never was. ..This set of "gotcha" questions is a wonderful example of how foolish cryptocurrency fanatics can be. ..Ethereum is a currency, not an investment. If you think you invest now, "hold on for dear life" and wait as supply shrinks and therefore value increases, you are dead wrong.

1
LUSD seems solid. Decentralized and can't be frozen. Not sure about the others, but freeze resistance is key.
3
The team behind LUSD is also about to roll out another stable coin this year BOLD, which looks to solve the issues LUSD is dealing with now - like extremely high collateral ratios to mint..but LUSD is an immutable and decentralized as it gets, no freezing, no governance changes, no contract upgrades, no single front end dependency
2
If you want max decentralization, go for the immutable LUSD. crvUSD, GHO, USDx is decentralized enough. USDT and USDC are not prone to freezing as long as you're not holding millions.
2
To add to the other comment, DAI is basically "complete". It isn't going to lose its relevance any time soon because it functions autonomously and MakerDAO doesn't need to do any hands-on governing.
2
USD+ seems legit
1
> Dai is over..I don't think this is accurate. It is true that MakerDAO plans to make a different stablecoin, that, yes, can be frozen. But as I understand, nothing right now is planned on "ending" dai. It'll just be deprioritized when it comes to new development. Of course, you may still prefer to switch stablecoins, but I just wanted to add a bit more nuance to the topic.
1
What?!
0
can u explain the diff mechanics of them?
1
All of them are similar CDP-based stablecoin with different liquidation mechanism and collateral. LUSD is special because it's exclusively backed by ETH and immutable. crvUSD, GHO, and USDx controlled by DAOs and backed by many type of tokens.

It's in the hands of the THOR Chain Router, It's just a matter of waiting. Here's some light reading while you wait....There are four phases of a transaction sent to THORChain each taking time to complete...L1 Inbound Confirmation - assuming the inbound Tx will be confirmed in the next block, it is the source blockchain block time...Observation Counting - time for 67% THOR Chain Nodes to observe and agree on the inbound Tx...Confirmation Counting - for non-instant finality blockchains, the amount of time THOR Chain will wait before processing to protect against double spends and re-org attacks...Outbound Delay - dependent on size and network traffic. Large outbounds will be delayed...L1 Outbound Confirmation - Outbound blockchain block time...Wait times can be between a few seconds up to an hour. ..The assets being swapped, the size of the swap and the current network traffic within THOR Chain will determine the wait time...If a transaction fails it is refunded, thus it will pay the Outbound fee for the Source Chain not the Destination Chain.

you dont take it out, you wait until it reaches a new ATH, which it will, in time
32
You lost nothing. You have exactly the same amount of ETH as you had 3 years ago..Calm down and wait.
12
you're not down bad on 1 ETH.
15
For what it's worth.  I would take advantage of the current low ETH price and continue to add.  I don't know your financial situation, but if you add a little each paycheck, you can bring down your average significantly. ETH will most certainly rebound.  When, nobody knows, but it will.
3
You should continue to buy and stake ETH, and then wait 10 years...Also, learn to self-custody.  Coinbase is one of the better CEXs, but please learn how to manage crypto yourself, without 3rd parties. No rush, however.
3
Lend it out on aave as collateral and then you can get a loan to yield farm an extra 1% or buy something else. I would recommend swapping to cbETH btw, it's the liquid staking token.
3
Dont sell. Hold tight.
1
be patient my fren, and do literally nothing
1
You’re only down bad if you sell it. If you buy now you lower your average cost. The only solution is to buy more but don’t be spending money you need to live.
1
But the dip, swap for a liquid staking derivative like rETH to get some yield in the meantime and wait.
1
How is it losing value? If you bought 1.043 ETH you still have 1.043 ETH.
1
You can also stake on Lantern Finance. Coinbase staking fees are too high
1
You do not sound very crypto savvy, otherwise I would have suggested using your ETH on a couple of new protocols that allow you to farm their tokens. As it stands, you're better off leaving your ETH as it is. It will definitely get back to ATH and you can use it as you desire.
1
My advice is to cash out and put your value into actual investments that create value, like dividend producing stocks and ETFs.  You'll hear other bagholders here tell you to "HODL" because that's what everybody must do in order to allow early adopters to cash out big.  You are not early.  You're way late.  Every moment you wait, is a moment someone who came in earlier than you, is extracting value from the market -- value that may or may not ever return...Also, read the ToS of these staking systems, it's pretty scary the liabilities you expose yourself to staking.
-5
Why are you keeping crypto on centralised exchanges? I suggest you do some research on what cryptocurrency is and a high level of how it works before you dump thousands of dollars into something you don't understand.
-5
If you aren't going to take it out and stake it somewhere else, you might as well just "stake" it on Coinbase.

This is almost comedic. The New York stock exchange has been around for hundreds of years, so he'd definitely be way later entering the stock market then entering the crypto market. The crypto market is still in its infancy. Patience is a virtue. Time in the market far outweighs timing the market and that goes for both crypto and stocks.

Don’t plan on taking it out per say. When I break even I want to convert that to bitcoin. And the one I got in coinbase imma keep and never take out.

Yea true, and once you realize how powerful the platform is, it's really eye opening.

It’s great advice because OP gets to tax loss harvest. Side note why buy at ATH, hold past the lows, then consider selling here? Market isn’t great right now.

Its not work less... its worth 1.043 ETH...Stop thinking in terms of fiat money.
1
> This is almost comedic. ..What's comedic is you guys' constant desire to pretend crypto is just like the stock market...>The New York stock exchange has been around for hundreds of years, so he'd definitely be way later entering the stock market then entering the crypto market...This is true, but "being early" in stocks doesn't matter as much as being early in the crypto market, due to the fact that *stocks create value in fiat, through the sale of products and services*.  ..I know you guys love to compare crypto to stocks, but they're fundamentally different instruments. ..The *only* way you can extract value out of crypto is through liquidation, aka DIvesting your holdings.  As such, the return model on crypto is more like a Ponzi Scheme, than an investment scheme.  The same cannot be said for stocks in the traditional sense (that pay dividends -- Note that it was illegal until the 1980s for companies to be able to buy back stock shares - so treating stocks like speculative commodities is more of a new invention than traditional)...So in crypto, getting in early is everything...In stocks, you don't have to get in early.  You just have to pick a stock that creates value and has a good business model...Crypto's only business model is "find a greater fool to buy my bags at a higher price."
-2
Yeah aave is amazing love DeFi..Also ur name is funny as hell bro haha

I would actually rather not compare crypto to stocks, but it seems to be what most people understand. Most people can't grasp the concept of crypto because they don't see an inherent value. The value of anything is based on what people will pay for it. Since crypto is becoming more popular and more useful, people are willing to pay more for it. Getting out of crypto now would be like getting out of Apple stock shortly after its IPO. Crypto's business model is actually to decentralize finance so people can control their own money instead of the banks. It's also to create smart contracts and integrate secure blockchain, amongst many other uses. ..The only way to extract value is not through liquidation. Crypto can be used for purchases. When was the last time you used a stock to buy tickets to a sporting event or a new vehicle? ..All I'm saying is that you might want to reserve your advice to OP for something you know a little bit more about. You might understand the stock market, but you're steering this person in the wrong direction with crypto

> Most people can't grasp the concept of crypto because they don't see an inherent value...That we can agree on...>The value of anything is based on what people will pay for it...Again, this is true, **but** how people "value" things is a very important metric you're ignoring...For example, I value fresh water, not simply because it's popular, but *because I need it to survive.*   ..This is called, "intrinsic value."  It means whether or not I personally like or enjoy or am excited about water, I still need it...Crypto has no such attributes.  All of it's value is what is called "extrinsic."   It's value is a function of popularity, not material utility.  And this is a very important factor to take into consideration when you evaluate whether or not an asset has the ability to maintain long term value.  There's insufficient evidence crypto tokens can do so...>Since crypto is becoming more popular and more useful, people are willing to pay more for it. ..I would say this is begging the question.  I think it's arguable that crypto is becoming more popular and useful...We're 15 years into this, and still nobody as answered [the ultimate crypto question](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/), citing a specific real-world, non-criminal use case, for which blockchain tech is the best solution.  All disruptive technology that has stood the test of time has answered that question.  Crypto continues to evade it by suggesting, "It's still early."..>Getting out of crypto now would be like getting out of Apple stock shortly after its IPO. ..Again, another completely absurd comparison.   Apple creates products and services that are objectively useful, and in some cases superior to any existing technology.   The iPhone definitely is one of the best communication devices in the industry.  You can't say  the same about crypto.  As I mentioned before, you guys are still struggling to find something crypto is uniquely good at, and have failed so far...And this is why people like myself take offense to your statements...You are free to believe whatever you want to believe about crypto.  But when you make material claims like crypto is like early Apple stock, that can be examined and proven to be completely false.  And it's not nice to spread misinformation...>Crypto can be used for purchases. When was the last time you used a stock to buy tickets to a sporting event or a new vehicle? ..Again, you keep doing the thing you said you'd rather not do.   Don't you see how hypocritical you are?..Since it's been so long, almost FOUR SENTENCES AGO you said:..>I would actually rather not compare crypto to stocks..For this argument, you're flip-flopping between two separate concepts: crypto as a currency verses crypto as an investment.  You have to pick a lane bro...>All I'm saying is that you might want to reserve your advice to OP for something you know a little bit more about. ..Again, instead of debunking my claims, you move the goalpost, change the subject, and engage in personal attacks, suggesting I don't know what I'm talking about...People (who are truly objective) can read this and see for themselves, who is being evasive and who is stating the truth...If you want to change the subject, we can: As a currency, crypto fails miserably as well.  It's too slow, not scalable, wastes too many resources, requires much more elaborate software and setups than traditional payment systems.  It also involves mysterious transaction fees that randomly fluctuate based on other factors.  Using crypto as a payment medium really doesn't work.  It also opens people up to money laundering and sanctions violating liabilties, which is why it's basically not used for payments anywhere...The exception doesn't prove the rule.  Just because you can buy some fentanyl or a Russian VPN or a coffee using crypto, doesn't mean it's very useful for payments...Again, let me reiterate, you are free to believe what you want.  But it's inappropriate to spread false information.  That's fraud.  I wish you guys could promote your schemes without telling lies about the technology.  That's all I ask. Stop telling lies.

I think we've strayed too far away from the OP's original question which is how to grow his/her portfolio. That answer is simple: leave the existing Ethereum alone and add to it. The history of crypto market cycles heavily suggest that there will be a significant run-up in the very near future. If you believe crypto has little worth and will soon disappear, then I totally understand your argument. However, most crypto investors don't believe that. I'm not promoting any schemes or lies about technology. My business actually accepts crypto payments and I think it's going to be a huge part of our financial future. I'm simply someone who has been following and investing in crypto since 2016. I am also of the opinion that I would rather control my money than have predatory banks controlling it. I mean, the 08/09 crash was largely due to the greed of US financial institutions. I'm not sure why anyone would want to keep supporting them unless they absolutely have to.

> I think we've strayed too far away from the OP's original question which is how to grow his/her portfolio...Translation: Let's change the subject *again* because I can't argue against your responses...>That answer is simple: leave the existing Ethereum alone and add to it. The history of crypto market cycles heavily suggest that there will be a significant run-up in the very near future...Seriously... don't you guys know anything about the fundamentals of investing?  One of the most basic principals is this: **Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.**..> I mean, the 08/09 crash was largely due to the greed of US financial institutions. ..ROFL... riiight.. and good thing people in the crypto industry aren't greedy..  lololol..Greed was not the causal factor.  Again, you should do proper [research](http://bsalert.com/news/2416/What_Caused_The_Second_Depression_In-A-Nutshell.html).  The 2008 financial mess was directly caused by *de-regulation*.  The default credit swaps and securitized mortgages used to pump up the housing market were **illegal** for 70+ years until in 2000, three republicans (Gramm, Leach, Bliley) introduced deregulation into the Financial Services Modernization Act of 2000, which made those schemes legal again.  That's what caused the problem: taking central authorities out of the mix when they were keeping banks under control.  And you think replacing that with an even less regulated free-for-all in the crypto industry is an improvement?  That's absurd.
1
Hey, you do you. I'm quite happy with my crypto returns that have well outperformed my stock investments. Nobody said that past performance is a guarantee, but crypto market cycles have so far been much more repetitive than anything else. .. You don't get it. That's fine. I just don't think you should be spreading ignorance and fear to those looking for solid advice on Eth. .. You stick to stocks, we'll stick to crypto. Maybe check out r/stocks to find some more like-minded individuals. New tech is scary for some.

Nah dude you don't actually get it when you believe that the crush was about greed and whatnot when, as the guy so accurately put it, it was the deregulation...Gambling is fine if you don't get addicted and you just gamble.

If the token serves a real purpose this developer commission burn is neither here nor there. Unfortunately these tokenomics are just part of the memecoin / scamcoin MO.

I might be slow, but I can't grasp what "neither here nor there" means haha. It means it has no effect on future price?
1
If you imagine MAKER or another token with actual utility had a small trading commission it wouldn't affect the mechanics of DAI and its stability mechanism. It might have a lower price to reflect less demand. What its long term effect on price is anyone's guess.

Check out Etherscan or BSCScan, depending on the chain. Most tokens have a "Holders" tab there. If it's not showing up, might be a newer or less tracked token. Just a heads up though, some projects get sneaky with multiple wallets. Still, it's a good start for DYOR.

Quite fitting, I had an ad for a Starknet game directly next to the article.....www.influenceth.io..Yet, way to go for targetted marketing since I already knew the project...
3
I've been playing Influence which runs on Starknet and it has been very enjoyable so far. The ETH conversion from L1 to L2 was pretty easy to use.
2
Blimey! You mean to say asides from the fact that starknet got pretty much the hate, more developers are opting to learn cairo? What am I missing?
2
Their strong community engagement and solid technical foundation seem to be big factors. It’s clear their focus on developer support and innovation is paying off.
1
Do you really need an analysis for that? Scamnet is hated because people know they have given majority of the airdrops to developers.

Nope. Ignore them. Will save you your portfolio and some
5
Send the token CAs and I’ll check them out, but generally no I wouldn’t. No one is giving away free money, so unless there’s a reason you have then I wouldn’t.
7
Typically it’s the approval transaction that will screw you when trying to sell these so you can try sending the tokens to an EOA and selling from there- but honestly you should be incredibly cautious dealing w any tokens you’re unfamiliar with cause they’re constantly cooking new ways to fuck us
2
Better check if those tokens are on sushiswap or uniswap first.
1
As long as you can try to sell them on whatever DEX you normally use, you're fine.  The scam is usually they make some token with a URL in the name and it can't be transferred.  If you try to sell it, it'll fail and if you go to Etherscan there will be an error code saying like, "Trade on bullshitswap.io" or something.  If you go there you're dead.
1
Safe to sell if you can sell them yes, if you cant sell them. They are scam tokens.. but the air drops are a way of new upcoming memecoins to create exposure for themselves...if you catch the airdrop soon enough. You can get it before others start noticing
1
I'll just hold and see what happens next
1
You may have been targeted for a dusting attack. Meaning, somebody wants to know who you are. If that somebody is a criminal, you may be targeted IRL eventually...More here: [https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin#section-costs-associated-with-dusting](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin#section-costs-associated-with-dusting)..But yes, if you don't have much money, and aren't running from the government or other organisations, it's safe to dump your airdropped dust on trusted DEXes like sushiswap and uniswap.
1
Selling them on a dex isn't an issue. Usually scam tokens don't let you sell on a dex and give you some error message that might refer to a scam site...The actual scam is getting you on that scam site to sign a malicious transaction.
11
I read the article and it never makes it clear. How is receiving some dust is going to deanonymize you?
6
Dusting can be used to identify other addresses that also belong to a set of keys on chains that use UTXO, like Bitcoin. Etheruem doesn't use UTXO, so this isn't relevant at all to the OPs situation.
3
Does not deanonymize you. More likely they're just hoping you accidentally transfer funds to their address by making and copy paste error...it has happened...Sometimes the address sending you dust is custom made to slightly resemble your address in order to trick you into making a mistake.

It’s like swapping tokens, your swapping into rETH which gains interest over time, tax free until sold for most areas but I’m not at tax professional. Same would be with lido you’d be swapping ETH into stETH. But that one I think is taxable interest. Liquid staking tokens!

I do. My whole savings are in it. Quite up I must say.
36
There is a whole ecosystem of people building software around smart contracts targeting the EVM. Then there is an ecosystem of builders working to scale Ethereum so it can support future demand. These folks are Ethereum maxis. It’s not so much about the price of Ethereum, but that does matter to incentivize validators.
14
I love ETH and all of its technology.
3
Plenty of us, but we're not religious nut-jobs like the Bitcoin maxis..I don't think there's anything wrong with other assets, I don't think there's anything wrong with other chains (I use Solana and Cosmos too). I just prefer the Ethereum ecosystem.
7
Depends on how you define maxi...If you mean people who say it is the best but can't explain why, or can only explain in a circular logic (there is no second best, so it is the best), ethereum has much less that kind of maxis than bitcoin...If you mean people who understand every technology details behind blockchain, and can explain why their favorite project is designed the way it is, ethereum has much more that kind of maxis...If you mean people who allocate most of their life savings into it, ethereum actually has more that kind of maxis too. When you understand what you are investing, and what unreplaceable use cases it provides, there is much less fear.  Most bitcoin maxis pretend they believe in bitcoin, deep down, they know security budget problem is real, they know can't run programs on chain makes no sense, even if they don't fully understand, they can sense something is wrong. So their allocation is at most 10%-20%.
3
They do exist (I think Sassal and the bankless guys jump to mind but they may have changed tune lately), but Ethereum saw maximalism eat BTC and I think most of us don't want to fall into the same trap. I see more aggression from Solana (I think because Toly shits on ETH constantly) towards ETH than vice-versa but ultimately it doesn't matter. Competition is healthy and ethereum is FAR from perfect.
3
yes but they don't have enough karma to comment here
2
There is a dutch guy Didi Taihuttu. He sold everything he had. His house, his car, even his daughters toys and barbies. Sold it all for Bitcoin. And now living and preaching Bitcoin. Never heard anyone go monkey mode all in to Ethereum.
2
Yes but we are open minded so could move partly to other chains if it makes sense. Bitcoin maxipads are closed minded and would not consider using other things.

It seems that Maxi-ism requires an existential threat....Maxis need forks and alt coins to contend with otherwise there's really no point in being so die-hard about the One True Way to (Not) Use The One True Coin.

Yet...Decades ago the internet did nothing better than BBSes that were subscribed to various nets(message nets, or file nets.)...Now, no one knows what a BBS was, or is(still exist though many are accessible only via Telnet rather than direct connection via a modem.)..Even the early days of the internet offered very little compared to using mail to send, and receiving small bits of information, and it was far worse than mail for sending, and receiving vast quantities of information, and to a point it still is for yet larger quantities of information....Today, 67.1% of the world uses the internet. In 2018, only 53% of the world used it but, I’d imagine everyone in 2018 felt the vast majority of the world was online...The fact there isn’t a “single function better in blockchain compared to a non-blockchain equivalent technology” is evidence we’re early, not that it’s useless...Decades ago the internet provided very little value, and everyone in the media decried it as being useless, and politicians stated it was a waste of funds yet in retrospect it was clearly a good decision to continue forward with it...Blockchain technologies will one day provide an invaluable service even if we are as of yet unaware of what it could be. Personally, I think it’ll be more valuable as a way to ensure online users are real as we face the bot invasion, and AI issues that are becoming more prevalent with each passing day. Everyone is trying to use it for finance which, in my opinion, is a mistake even if it’s useful as a use-case to ensure the other necessary technologies for a better future are built upon it, and around it.

Of course I've heard of them.  This is just leveraged gambling within the crypto ecosystem.  It has no value outside of it...Staking is just a scheme to keep people from cashing out in order to avoid the impending liquidity crisis...DeFi is a scheme where people can engage in even more highly risky, highly-leveraged bets in the crypto ecosystem.  ..Again, all of that could disappear tomorrow and have zero effect on any systems in the real world.

> Yet...lol... it didn't take 15 years for any of the tech you cited to prove it could do something better and useful...>Decades ago the internet did nothing better than BBSes that were subscribed to various nets(message nets, or file nets.)...Sorry, you are incorrect.  I was an early pioneer in this industry.  I even wrote my own BBS software so I know what I'm talking about...What made the Internet special was the Internet was a larger computer network that was managed by the US Government, thus it wasn't owned by any particular private corporation.  This meant that any other computer system could "peer" with the Internet and exchange data like e-mail -- without any single corporation metering the traffic and activity.  This was groundbreaking from day one.  The Internet clearly demonstrated being better than existing networks (such as AOL, The Source, Compuserve, etc. all of which were walled corporate gardens that were more expensive)...While it took many more years for the Internet to become ubiquitous, the value the technology brought *was evident from day one*.  Making it more affordable to connect simply added even more value to a technology that was already an improvement over what we were using...http protocol was pretty groundbreaking and innovative, as was ftp and other services that the Internet introduced.  All of this tech did things better than what we already had.  Same thing with POP3 e-mail services.  It was a universal standard that wasn't proprietary to any corporation.  ..You could argue blockchain is similar in that it isn't owned by any corporation, but blockchain doesn't do anything better than what we already have.  The tech [is inferior by every measurable metric to modern database/ledgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA).  So its decentralized nature doesn't matter when it offers no real utility - and you yourself admit that...So your argument there fails...And cherry picking the occasional pundit who erroneously said they didn't think the Internet had potential, is just a distraction....>Blockchain technologies will one day provide an invaluable service even if we are as of yet unaware of what it could be...No.  Sorry.  There's no indication that blockchain will improve upon anything we already have.   There was evidence the moment the Internet came out, that it would...Bad argument.  Bad analogy.

>All your public actions will be made on a blockchain in the future : Voting and Polling, purchasing real estate, your marriage certificate, your education diplomas…..Yea, that's not going to happen.   Rather than write and explain why that won't happen, in this case, I've produced a video that clearly demonstrates [how and why blockchain is incapable of verifying the authenticity of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2108s) - it pretty much decimates your claim with real world examples that you guys yourself will often use.  But once you produce a real-world application and look at what blockchain does, your claims fall apart.  Watch the video and learn...EDIT: coward /u/oxAERG..responded and then blocked me so I couldn't reply...He's 100% wrong, so wrong, he doesn't want me to reply to him to prove it.

> Which non-blockchain is better at providing a standard API to interact with a non-temperable, unhackable universal DB?...>Which non-blockchain tech can suppress identity theft risks and hold your digital credentials than you can use across various platforms across the web and the physical world alike?...ANY database that uses similar cryptographic hashing to verify the integrity of records on file...You guys act like you invented cryptography.  You didn't.  It's widely in use *everywhere* and the relational database systems that use it, can do the exact same things blockchain does, but cheaper, faster, can scale more, and use less resources and have the added benefit of not promoting everything from cyber terrorism to human trafficking...EDIT: coward /u/oxAERG responded and then blocked me so I couldn't reply...He's 100% wrong, so wrong, he doesn't want me to reply to him to prove it...>The difference that you forget in your equation is decentralization, which removes the need to trust a central authority...I didn't forget it.  I even have a [crypto talking point debunking it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/wiki/talkingpoints#wiki_stupid_crypto_talking_point_.231_.28decentralized.29) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s) as well...But you blocked me so you could get the last word.

>Credentials, IDs, official records, public personal data, all of this will be on a blockchain and is already in some countries like Estonia and in some extent Argentina and Brazil...>Europe as a whole is going there as well (see eIDAS)..Ahh yea, ye 'ol "Blockchain has potential" argument, and claiming it's being endorsed by x or y...I have two things I've written which debunk those claims:...#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #15 (potential).."**It's still early!**" / **"Blockchain technology has potential"** , **"Let's call it 'DLT' Distributed Ledger Technology this month and pretend it's different."** / **"Crypto is like the Internet!"**..1.  We are 15 (FIFTEEN) YEARS into this so-called "technology" and to date, [there's not been a single thing blockchain tech does better than existing non-blockchain tech](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).2.  Truly disruptive technology is obvious from the beginning - sometimes there's hurdles to adoption (usually costs and certain prerequisites, but none of that applies to blockchain - anybody who has internet access can utilize the tech).  It didn't take 15 years for people to realize the Internet was useful - what held it up were access to computers and networks. There's nothing stopping blockchain IF it offered any really useful service - it doesn't..3.  Just because someone says they're "looking into" something, doesn't mean it will ever manifest into an actual workable system.  Every time we've seen major institutions claim they were "developing blockchain systems", they've almost always failed.  From [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-blockchain-platform-software-reaches-end-support-april-30-2023) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/) to [Maersk](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/30/ibm_and_maersk_tradelens_shutdown/) to [Foreign Countries](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/) - the vast majority of these projects are eventually abandoned because they aren't economically or technologically viable..4. The **default position** is to be skeptical blockchain has any potential until it is demonstrated.  And most common responses to this question are the other "[stupid crypto talking points.](https://ioradio.org/i/crypto-talking-points/)"  Additional references: [1](https://youtu.be/dAVfcCkFYqE)..And then there's the endorsement argument - most of which are false anyway......#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #8 (endorsements?).."**[Big Company/Banana Republic/Politician] is exploring/using bitcoin/blockchain!  Now will you admit you were wrong?**" / "**Crypto has 'UsE cAs3S!'**" / "**EEE TEE EFFs!!one**".. 1.  The original claim was that crypto was "disruptive technology" and was going to "replace the banking/finance system".  There were all these claims suggesting blockchain has tremendous "potential".  Now with [the truth slowly surfacing regarding blockchain's inability to be particularly good at anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA), crypto people have backpedaled to instead suggest, "Hey it has 'use-cases'!"   .. Congrats!  You found somebody willing to use crypto/blockchain technology.  That still is not an endorsement of crypto or blockchain.  I can choose to use a pair of scissors to cut my grass.  This doesn't mean scissors are "the future of lawn care technology."  It just means I'm an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available.  .. The operative issue isn't whether crypto & blockchain can be "used" here-or-there.  The issue is: *Is there a good reason?  Does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using?*  And the answer to that is, [No.](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/).. 2.  Most of the time, [adoption claims are outright wrong](https://mashable.com/article/helium-removes-lime-and-salesforce-logos). Just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government, corporation or other entity is embracing crypto.  It usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said, "We'll look into it" and that got interpreted as "adoption imminent!". 3.  In cases where companies did launch crypto/blockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories:.  * Some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some "crypto project" involving a well known entity that never got off the ground, or was tried and failed miserably (such as [IBM/Maersk's Tradelens](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens), [Australia's stock exchange](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/), etc.).  * Companies (like VISA, Fidelity or Robin Hood) **are not embracing crypto directly**.  Instead they are *partnering with a crypto exchange* (such as BitPay) that will either handle all the crypto transactions and they're merely licensing their network, or they're a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat.  There's no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto, or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto.  It's a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws..  . 4.  Sometimes, politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve -- [this almost always fails](https://truthout.org/articles/miamis-mayor-went-all-in-on-cryptocurrency-his-constituents-suffered/), but again, crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal, while ignoring any follow-up materials that say such a proposal was rejected... 5.  Just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesn't mean, "It's the future."..  McDonald's bundled [Beanie Babies](https://i.imgur.com/McdwlxA.jpg) with their Happy Meals for a time, when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme.  Corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money, and the moment these fads fade, they drop any association and pretend it never happened.  This has already occurred with many tech companies from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/).  Even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago, proponents still hype the projects as if they're still active... 6. Crypto ETFs are not an endorsement of crypto.  They're simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts.  These entities do not care at all about the future of crypto.  It's just a way for them to make more money with fees, and just like in #4, the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme, they'll drop it.  It's simply businesses taking advantage of a fad.  Crypto ETFs though are actually worse, because they're a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market -- if crypto was a viable *alternative* to TradFi, then these gimmicky things wouldn't be desirable... 7. Countries like El Salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really haven't in any meaningful way.  El Salvador's endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own non-transparent software, "Chivo" that is not on bitcoin's main blockchain - and as such isn't really bitcoin adoption as much as it's bitcoin exploitation.  Plus, USD is the real legal tender in El Salvador and since BTC's adoption, use of crypto has stagnated.  In two years, the country's investment in BTC has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account.  Also note [Venezuela has now scrapped its state-sanctioned cryptocurrency](https://www.foreignbrief.com/venezuela-to-scrap-state-cryptocurrency/)..So, whenever you hear "so-and-so company is using crypto" always be suspect.  What you'll find is either that's not totally true, or if they are, they're partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association, not unlike an advertiser/licensing relationship.   **Not** adoption.  Exploitation.   And temporary at that...We've seen absolutely no increase in crypto adoption - in fact quite the contrary.  More and more people in every industry from [gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust) to [banking](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-federal-reserve-rejects-crypto-focused-banks-application-be-supervised-by-2023-01-27/), are rejecting deals with crypto companies....Note that these are not someone else's cut-and-paste.  This is my own personal research and citations...EDIT: coward /u/oxAERG..responded and then blocked me so I couldn't reply...He's 100% wrong, so wrong, he doesn't want me to reply to him to prove it.

The ability to make crypto payments is not in any way comparable or competitive to existing online payment systems...In fact, it's absurd you'd even use such an obviously failed argument...Maybe you're too  young to remember when Steam used to accept Bitcoin?  That failed miserably because bitcoin transactions were slow AF and the price was so unstable that it was a liability to use it as a payment medium.  The same holds true today.

> i can get a loan at around a TVL of 80% instantly any where in the world without a credit check or third party...LOL.  No you can't.  Are you saying you can put up 100 Eth and get a loan of 80% of the market value of that Eth?   "anywhere in the world?"   Yea, I guess if you count scammers who will take your Eth and disappear you can...I'm wondering if you're talking about flash loans?  Those are even more absurd.  That's not really a loan.  It's highly leveraged gambling.  ..>People who don’t interact with Dapps sure have a lot to say about their utility..And people who speak in vague generalities love to make claims for which there is insufficient evidence they're true...Even if you could do something like that, it really doesn't make much sense. You're only getting a loan in crypto for crypto.  It's not fiat.  You'd still lose more value converting into fiat, IF you could - you don't know if the crypto you get in return was used in dark transactions and would get your accounts frozen.  Plus, even the legit ones (if there are any, which I doubt) would  have some predatory margin call parameters...That whole scheme is *nothing* like TradFi.  If I take a loan out from the bank, and use property as collateral, and property prices change, that's the bank's problem, not mine.  My loan isn't cancelled if the value of the collateral changes.  But in the world of crypto, you can do nothing wrong, and have you loan collapse at any time.  It's crazy.  It's nothing like traditional lending.  You guys should come up with your own word for schemes like that to differentiate the highly dangerous,  highly-risky world of DeFi from the traditional world of lending.

> Bitcoin is the only place you can realistically protect yourself against inflation...There's no actual evidence bitcoin is a hedge against inflation. In reality, the price of BTC (as well as other cryptos) clearly correlates with standard ebb in flow of other markets like the stock market, in response to inflation and other factors...>Bitcoin is the only currency you can buy that cannot be debased by a central authority manipulating the supply. ..This is also patently false.  There's more than a$160B of unsured, unaudited stablecoins who are being freely wash-traded in the market against BTC and other cryptos.  Tether has never been formally audited and nobody knows where the liquidity backing up those tokens exists.  So that fake money has absolutely inflated the value of crypto...>Name one currency or commodity you can buy, that is accessible to almost anybody, even at poverty level..That's not bitcoin.  The vast majority of "un-banked" around the world have no need for bitcoin because they have no disposable income.  Nor do they have access to the Internet or smart phones...Again, your statement is categorically false.  *Any* poverty level?  You're delusional...>where you can guarantee the supply will never change...Another false statement.  There are multiple versions of the bitcoin blockchain alone, each with 21M tokens allocated.   Plus, any version of bitcoin could be easily modified with a change to a few lines of code to increase the amount of tokens in circulation.  You cannot guarantee in the future this won't be done...Every single claim you made is totally false...I also debunk your claims in the following crypto talking point rebuttals that I myself wrote.  The links below provide detailed, credible citations to back up each one of my counter arguments:...* [Debunking crypto as an inflation hedge](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/wiki/talkingpoints#wiki_stupid_crypto_talking_point_.233_.28inflation.29).* [Debunking the 21M/scarcity claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/wiki/talkingpoints#wiki_stupid_crypto_talking_point_.234_.28scarcity.29).* [Debunking the notion that crypto is immune from central influences](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/wiki/talkingpoints#wiki_stupid_crypto_talking_point_.231_.28decentralized.29).* [Debunking the claim that crypto helps "bank the un-banked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/wiki/talkingpoints#wiki_stupid_crypto_talking_point_.237_.28remittances.29)

And, then I sold a car for Bitcoin, use that as collateral for a USDT loan, used that to buy a new computer, used that to start software consulting and your argument falls apart...Money is money. Fiat is one way to get there. But, it’s not a necessary or sufficient property of sound money. Finance is finance. Peer to peer finance is the old way brought back with new efficiency.

!remindme 1 year..Yea, let's do this...Today's Eth price: 2769.14  (based on crooked exchanges - nobody really knows the true organic price of any crypto given all the monopoly money stablecoins that have inflated the market)..I'm not saying I guarantee the price of Eth will be zero or at any particular value in the future.  That's not because I believe it has any legitimate value.  It's because I acknowledge this market is so unregulated and manipulated, it would be foolish to make predictions.  There's a saying: *The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent* and that applies here. ..But what I can say is, at some point, it all will crash.  The writing is on the wall.  I just can't say when that will happen, and how many more pump-and-dumps will happen before then.

I guess you're mistaken. As this clearly was one of the reasons eth was declared not a security.  .It's sufficient decentralized.

It’s already there dude.

The difference that you forget in your equation is decentralization, which removes the need to trust a central authority...As for human trafficking and cybercriminality, most blockchains operate with a public record, and regulation is coming to ban anonymity enforcing chains such as Monero, so this has nothing to do with Blockchain’s design.

>The ability to make crypto payments is not in any way comparable or competitive to existing online payment systems...Existing online payment systems aren't open to everyone.  With crypto any developer anywhere in the world can add payments to their software.  No gatekeepers.  Pretty amazing.

yes i can lmao. i’ve done it. look into the AAVE protocol. i can get a crypto — crypto loan. stable coin —— crypto. crypto —— stable coin. ..I’ve got six figures of LINK locked up in the protocol. i’ve borrowed USDC, ETH, WBTC.

First off, I doubt you're telling the truth, but even if you were, the exception doesn't prove the rule.  99.99999% of most places will not accept bitcoin as a payment medium...>Peer to peer finance is the old way brought back with new efficiency...You guys don't even know what P2P means...Crypto is not peer-to-peer...When you send crypto to another "peer" you never interact with them directly.  Instead it's peer-to-middlemen and peer-to-middlemen - the node operators who maintain the .centralized ledger that you voluntarily agree means something (while the rest of the world doesn't).  It's not P2P.  Sorry.  Without those middlemen, node operators, you couldn't do jack squat.

>Do you not see the clear parallel here? ..No not at all...>Try to send cash to China or Venezuela or Russia or Iran without their governments knowing about it. I know how I'd do it.....First off, crypto is not "cash."  Don't compare it to cash. It's not money.  It's just a digital token that 0.000001% of the population thinks has value.  Nobody else gives a shit.   Cash is much more ubiquitous.  You guys continue to make misrepresentations...Plus, even if crypto were "cash", it would be stupid to use blockchain since it keeps a permanent record of the transaction.
-1
You have my condolences...In all likelihood, you are laundering stablecoins for human trafficking and other criminal enterprises...Like I said before, it's still sketchy AF.    Are you providing KYC info when engaging in this activity?  Are borrowers?  If not, then it's most likely illegal in many jurisdictions and it's just a matter of time before it gets shut down like Tornado Cash...Also, there are tremendous liabilities and virtually no consumer protections.  You don't know if there are flaws in the protocols. There's no deposit insurance.  There's no guarantee of liquidity, etc...If you want to gamble, you can, but you're also likely engaging in/facilitating illegal activity.

> In America, Bitcoin is easier to use than Euros...ROFL... That's a lie.   ..Aside from the fact that it makes no sense to try and use Euro in American when it's not legal tender, I guarantee you more people attribute value to Euros than do Bitcoin...>If that’s the best you’ve got, you’ve run out of arguments. Have a nice day. ..I notice how you failed to refute my argument.  You just arbitrarily dismiss it.  That's what you guys do.  You just pretend you weren't bested when you were...This is why I contend: **There are no good actors in crypto.  Just varying degrees of bad actors** including people like yourself that just call people names when they can't argue rationally...>Hope currency debasement doesn’t eat the entirety of your retirement plans...Another ignorant, childish talking point:...#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #3 (inflation)..**"InFl4ti0n!!!"** / **"The dollar will eventually become worthless"** / **"The dollar has lost 104% of its value since 1900!"** / **"The government prints money out of thin air"**..1. The government does **not** "print money indefinitely"... all money in circulation is [tightly regulated and regularly audited and publicly transparent](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm).  The organization that manages the money in circulation is the Federal Reserve and contrary to what crypto bros claim, they're not a private cabal - they [are overseen and regulated by Congress](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm).  And any attempt to put more money in circulation [requires an Act of Congress to increase the debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) - it's neither arbitrary, nor easy to do...2. [Currency is meant to be *spent*, not hoarded](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/money-is-meant-to-be-spent-not-saved-9618edec676f).  A dollar today will buy what it buys. If you hold a dollar for 90 years, of course it won't buy the same thing decades later (although it might actually be worth significantly more as antique money).  You people don't seem to understand the first thing about how currency works - it's NOT an "investment!"  You **spend** it, *not* hoard it!..3.  If you are looking to "invest" you don't keep your value in cash/currency/fiat. You put it into something that can *create value* like stocks that pay dividends, real estate, etc.  Crypto creates no value and makes a lousy "investment."  It also hasn't proven to be a hedge against anything, least of all monetary inflation...4. Over time more money is put in circulation - you pretend like this is a bad thing, but it's not done in a vacuum.  The average annual wage in 1900 was less than $4000.  In 2023 [it's more than $70,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/)!  There's more people out there and the monetary supply grows appropriately, as does wages.  You can't take one element of the monetary system completely out of context and ignore everything else...5. The causes of inflation are **many**, and the amount of money in circulation is one of the least significant factors in causing the prices of things to rise.  More prominent inflationary causes are things like: [fuel prices](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-inflation-high-causes-gas-price-outlook-forecast-2022-7), [supply chain issues](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/supply-chain-issues-contribution-to-inflation.html), [war](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-effect-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-global-activity-and-inflation-20220527.html), environmental disasters, pandemics, and even [car dealerships](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-dealer-markups-helped-drive-inflation-study-finds-7c1d5a2d). ..6.  Sure there may be some nations that have caused out of control inflation as a result of their monetary policy (such as Zimbabwe) but comparing modern nations to third-world dictatorships is beyond absurd...7.  It is true that the US (and many other countries) ran up the deficit in 2020-2022 and put an unprecedented amount of capital into the market, but this was not a typical scenario.  It was a necessary move to address a **worldwide health pandemic** that forced billions out of work and crippled our supply chain and other areas of the economy. Inflationary spending is one of the tools governments use in times of crisis to maintain stability of society.  And this worked beautifully.  The end result, unfortunately, is increased debt, but this can and should be paid down in the future with responsible leadership.  That's how things go.  Crypto bros pretend the Covid pandemic was just another day and that the same type of inflation can happen again and again.  It was clearly a 100+ year event. Bitcoin could not have made the situation better - a deflationary currency would have created massive social and economic collapse, like what America had in the 1800s, that we learned we could stop by using inflation as a tool and managing it...8.  If bitcoin and crypto was an actually disruptive, stable, useful technology, you wouldn't need to promote lies and scare people over the existing system. The *real* reason you do this is [because nobody can find any legitimate reason to use crypto in the first place](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/)...9.  Crypto ironically has more inflation in its ecosystem that is even more out of control, than in any traditional fiat system.  At least with the US Dollar, money is accounted for and fully audited and it takes an Act of Congress to increase the debt.  In crypto, all it takes is a dude printing USDT, USDC, BUSD or any of the other unsecured stablecoins to just print more out of thin air, and crypto-morons assume they're worth $1 of value.

It's hilarious you guys seem to think the only way to get rich is by playing the crypto ponzi scheme.  I really feel sorry for you.

> Lol okay, 40% of Americans now own crypto..No they don't.  Where's the evidence of this?
0
I have not moved any goalposts.   You didn't argue against any of my arguments against AAVE.  You instead resorted to personal insults...AAVE is highly leveraged gambling - and it's likely illegal in many jurisdictions.  Where's your arguments against that?  Oh never mind just make jokes about my mom instead.
1
Shaky I guess https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/..Other surveys found anywhere between 9% to 20% so somewhere in there is probably more correct...Still a far cry from the 0.00001% or whatever you posited.
2
LOL... by your own admission you know that metric is bullshit...How are they determining individual Americans that own bitcoin?  I can't find any detailed methodology in that link.  How do you translate anonymous wallets to actual people, much less Americans?..There's no way that claim is true...A more realistic metric is Coinbase's claim that they have 8 million active accounts.   If that's true (and there's also reason to believe they're fudging what they mean by "active") then that's 8/333 = 2.4%...I bet even that figure is probably too high.  The problem is, when you factor people who might have dabbled with crypto but realized it didn't make sense and abandoned it, then it shouldn't be included...One of the main ways people try to answer this question is by looking at the number of crypto wallets created and using that to extrapolate people, but that's not a reliable metric because most crypto people have tons of different wallets -- especially across different chains...Also, we know from examining actual crypto wallets, 80+% of all BTC is  held in 0.1% of the wallets.  So this notion t hat there's 100 Million people with crypto, if that were true, they'd each probably have about twelve cents worth of BTC...A more interesting metric that you could actually dig up is this:..* How many wallets hold ANY BTC?..That's a number you could derive from the blockchain...According to [this](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) site (which parses the actual blockchain), there's 46,378,815 addresses that hold at least $1 of BTC...Here's how off your claims are... according to the actual blockchain, if every one of those 47 Million wallets with bitcoin were distinct Americans, that would only equal ~13% of all Americans...So yea... the actual math and data does not in any way back up your claims.
2
I don't hold any Bitcoin, been a crypto user for over a decade.
1
All crypto shares 99% of the same DNA.  You can pretend one is different from the other, but fundamentally they're not.
1
Even if that was true that has nothing to do with the point I'm making which is that I haven't touched my coinbase account in ages, I don't hold any bitcoin, and by your metrics you're not counting me as a crypto user. ..Also, plenty of the people that do own bitcoin use an exchange, and all their coins are in exchange wallets. ..But all of this ignores my point that the world's few central clearing houses are direct analogues to "AOL, The Source, Compuserve, etc. all of which were walled corporate gardens that were more expensive". ..We now have a financial world outside of those walled gardens, the same way the internet became an information world outside of those walled gardens.
1
What "financial world" do you have?  You guys love to hide behind vague generalities.  The reason for this, is because the moment you become specific enough to qualify what you mean as a "financial world" we find out it's a ineffective, poor copy of a third-rate, obsolete system that was abandoned decades, if not centuries ago...Stop making vague claims!..The "crypto financial world" has yet to prove it can do anything better than existing financial services we've been using for decades.  Either cite a specific example - SPECIFIC, or admit it's all just a scam...btw, I notice how you just ignored my argument destroying your claim that "40% of americans use crypto" - you think the vast majority of those people are holding ETH and CUMROCKET as opposed to BTC?  Really?..That's what you guys do.  You're so dishonest and disingenuous.  You make a claim. When your claim is proven to not hold water, do you admit you were wrong?  Nope.  You just change the subject and keep repeating the same debunked talking points over and over....'B..b..BUT CRYPTO CREATES A NEW FINANCIAL WORLD!" ....whatever tf that means.... /yawn.
1
I gave specific examples earlier, anonymous cross border remittances, and you instead dodged the point and disputed my use of the word "cash". ..I get that you're butthurt that the crypto ship sailed without you, despite your insistence and clear expertise being ignored. You just know it's going to sink any day now, and meanwhile the millions of users have all been on a global pleasure cruise. ..When that day comes I hope you feel some happiness. Surely any day now the otherwise smart people who have been duped by this vaporware will realize that they weren't as smart as you, AmericanScream. Cheers.

Just a smart contract that has limits. So like can only pull $100 vs all assets..A Vault is a secure smart contract that allows users to deposit tokens and NFTs, set limits, whitelist addresses, and require multiple signers for transactions. It is designed to enhance the security and management of digital assets...Vault Name..The unique name for your vault on this specific chain. It will be associated with a .vault.pay.eth domain if one is free but should not be relied on...Recovery Address..An address used for recovering access to the vault. It should be a secure, cold wallet address...Whitelist Addresses..Addresses that are allowed to interact with the vault as signers. These confirm transactions using your chosen threshold. Separate multiple addresses with commas...Safety Delay..A delay period in days to provide an extra layer of security for transactions that are not simple limit withdrawals. After the delay you can self approve txs without signers. Leave at 0 to require signers...Threshold..The number of signers required to confirm a transaction...Daily Limit..The maximum percentage of an asset that can be withdrawn from the vault daily...Freeze..The vault can be frozen to stop all withdrawals and transactions, the vault allows the vault owner, recovery address, or whitelisted addresses to freeze the vault on demand. Only the recovery address can unfreeze the vault.

They already have it - Thorswap.  Its a bit janky though I'd rather just trade via a CEX or WBTC

Other assets live on different blockchains so you'd need a fully decentralised bridge between the bitcoin chain and say Ethereum chain. Is that technically possible? (Genuine question btw, I'm not trying to be a dick or anything lol)

A decentralized Bitcoin Exchange would need to be build on Bitcoin protocol (if that's possible i don't know), but no Bitcoiner would use any other (less secure) protocol for this.  .Because here's the thing, since only Bitcoin is decentralized, you can't build a decentralized platform on anything else, it's like using sand instead of concrete for the foundation :)

That won’t be soon. It’s still very much the Wild West out there, and the level of technical knowledge to use defi is a huge barrier. ..We need an unbroken period of at least 10 years where a major protocol suffers no major issues. We need idiot-proof ways of transacting which means massive improvements to interfaces including devices. We need much, much better explanations of defi that anyone can grasp just as easily as they grasp tradfi. ..There are tons of shady exchanges, bridges and other tools out there. It’s hard to trust almost *any* of them...Aave is making traction and gaining trust. It has a good record. 5 years, no major hacks. Properly audited. Also Lido. But it’s going to take much longer. One major hack and all trust is lost...But that’s what gives this space insane upside still. Especially the likes of Ethereum… provided your risk appetite is there.

Umm, don’t Bitcoiners use Lightning ? ..And many use LSP’s. .And are encouraged to do so. ..Watched Saylor interviewing a LSP. .Watched Cathie Wood & Bitcoin Park enthusiastically recommend LSP’s. ..Endless vids & adverts for Strike, CashApp. .And promotions/ adverts on W BTC Did - for several custodians. Lending & such.

Lightning is non-custodial tho and uses native "currency", not a token.

16 years is new? lol ok. I’ve yet to see anyone outside of crypto echo chambers express any interest in using it for actual daily transactions. Even El Salvador tried and it failed miserably. If anything public sentiment toward crypto has plummeted in recent years and chances people will “wake up” as you say are pretty much as low as they have ever been.
1
 I’m not going to bother because clearly you’re incapable of understanding timelines. 16 years is VERY much new . You cannot revolutionise a whole financial ecosystem defined over thousands of years with a digital version of it but even then in those 16 years it had progressed to levels that people like you said at its start would never even reach ( me included ) ...You can stay ignorant that’s fine by me but don’t act like your shit don’t stink just because you’re a negative Nancy ..Also El Salvador never flopped idk what ur talking about

16 years is nothing when you’re talking about changing the global financial paradigm...Same with statecraft. You can’t just flip a switch and turn El Salvador into a G20 nation, even good ideas take time

Reality my friend. You’re the delusional one. No one wants crypto. It’s just a speculative asset not a useful tech. Have you seen how badly it failed in El Salvador even with government pushing it? It’s failed. I never say anything is certain but crypto replacing fiat currency is about as close to certainly not happening as it gets...Edit: haha bro blocked me cuz he’s so delusional he can’t even have a discussion or rationally respond to my points.

This is a great example of how and why blockchain and smart contracts are useless...What will settle this bet is based on who wins the 2024 election.  The blockchain won't know that information.  It has to be input by an "oracle."  Therefore whoever the "oracle" is, is the entity upon which the bet (and any trust anybody has) is vetted.  Blockchain and smart contracts have nothing to do with the process other than as an automated script to make a settlment.  You might as well just paypal the trusted third party who will serve as the Oracle to pay off the bet.  Plus you don't have to worry about all the liabilities of crypto...To learn more on why this is [see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2108s).

1
> Then have multiple oracles from different entities determine who the winner is. If they're all in agreement, then that person wins the money. ..It doesn't matter whether you have 1 or 1000 oracles.  It's an off-chain "trust" that determines the outcome of the transaction.  It has *nothing* to do with blockchain, and blockchain provides no guarantee of authenticity whatsoever.
1
In that case, you really, *really* should start considering asking modern AI, here is its reply, full of resources and examples. It'll be able to help you every step of your learning journey. No matter what language and skill/knowledge level you're at...To start learning Ethereum and writing a smart contract for handling a bet, especially with your background in JavaScript and Kotlin, you'll find it relatively easy to pick up Solidity, the primary language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. Here's a step-by-step guide and some resources to help you get started:..### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Ethereum and Smart Contracts.1. **Ethereum Basics**: Learn how Ethereum works, including concepts like gas, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and decentralized applications (dApps)..   - **Resource**: [Ethereum.org Introduction to Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/)..2. **Smart Contracts**: Understand what smart contracts are and how they are used in Ethereum..   - **Resource**: [Ethereum.org Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/)..### Step 2: Learn Solidity.Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Since you have experience in JavaScript, you might find Solidity's syntax somewhat familiar...1. **Solidity Documentation**: Start with the official documentation to understand the language's syntax and features..   - **Resource**: [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/)..2. **Solidity by Example**: This is a great resource that provides examples of simple contracts, which is a good starting point..   - **Resource**: [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)..### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment.You'll need a few tools to start writing and testing your smart contracts...1. **Remix IDE**: An online tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. It's great for beginners..   - **Resource**: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)..2. **Truffle Suite**: A popular development framework for Ethereum that includes tools for writing and testing smart contracts..   - **Resource**: [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)..3. **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests..   - **Resource**: [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)..4. **MetaMask**: A browser extension that acts as a wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It's useful for deploying contracts and interacting with dApps..   - **Resource**: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)..### Step 4: Write and Deploy the Betting Smart Contract.Now that you have your tools set up, you can write your smart contract. Here's a very simple outline of what your betting contract might look like:...```.contract ElectionBet {.    address payable public friend;.    address payable public me;.    bool public betResolved = false;.    address public winner;..    constructor(address payable _friend) payable {.        me = payable(msg.sender);.        friend = _friend;.    }..    function resolveBet(address _winner) public {.        require(msg.sender == me || msg.sender == friend, "Only participants can resolve the bet");.        require(!betResolved, "Bet already resolved");.        require(_winner == me || _winner == friend, "Winner must be a participant");..        winner = _winner;.        betResolved = true;..        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);.    }..    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {.        return address(this).balance;.    }.}..```..### Step 5: Test and Deploy the Contract.Use Remix or Truffle with Ganache to test your contract. Deploy it on a testnet (like Rinkeby or Goerli) before deploying on the mainnet...### Step 6: Learn More and Iterate.After your first smart contract, you might want to explore more advanced topics like contract security, gas optimization, and integrating smart contracts with frontend applications (using web3.js or ethers.js)...### Additional Learning Resources.1. **CryptoZombies**: An interactive Solidity tutorial where you build a game to learn Solidity step by step..   - **Resource**: [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)..2. **Ethernaut**: A series of Solidity security challenges that will help you learn more about writing secure contracts..   - **Resource**: [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)..By following these steps and using these resources, you'll be well on your way to writing your first Ethereum smart contract for handling a bet.

Why?   Code can be verified.
1
Yep, those certainly are words.
2
What do you think nodes are
1
Chatty hasn't learned that Truffle and also ganache was sunset. Use Hardhat. Also Remix is IMO a "demo tool" and not a great dev tool. I consider a SW dev productive with THEIR tool (Vs Code, IntelliJ, Vim, etc..) and to apply that tool to a wide variety of languages, including Solidity.
6
Lol hopefully the friend doesn't call `resolveBet()` as soon as the contract is launched
2
It often writes shitty code which can lead to lost funds
1
It depends on the context.  Nodes can be different things...On the Eth network, nodes manage the blockchain database.  But they aren't capable of processing any info that originates outside of their specific ecosystem, so when they need to act on something off-chain, they depend upon third parties to provide that data.  They have no capability to determine the truthfulness of any real world data, so there's inherent "trust" in whatever party interacts with them.  ..There's a false sense of security with all blockchain apps.  Blockchain pretends to be able to verify authenticity, and while blockchain is a scheme where you can't modify the database after it's been codified, it doesn't guarantee the validity of the actual data, just that when an Oracle provided it, it wasn't changed.  So with all blockchain applications, the integrity of the data is exclusively a function of the Oracles -- the non-blockchain people and other systems that feed data to the nodes.  The nodes are just robot scripts that store data.  They're like an incredibly inefficient hard drive, and little more.  If you put garbage on them (like NFTs of pixelated cats smoking cigarettes) then they store garbage.  G.I.G.O...It's not really anything to get excited about.  There are many more efficient database designs...If you'd like to learn more, just let me know.
1
It's not perfect, it makes mistakes, it sometimes references out data, nothing new, no tool is perfect, point is that it's a great guide whenever you're delving into something :)

It'll be a learning experience :)

I thought “Mastering Ethereum” was a good starting point. and it’s free on github. [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)..slightly dated (i.e. references defunct test nets) but that can be easily worked around.
12
Bitcoin hasn't done anything more or less in 7 years. I highly recommend the book 'Hijacking Bitcoin' written by Roger Ver (aka Bitcoin Jesus) that covers the history from before that time leading up to the fork to increase blocksize according to Satoshi's own specifications (hint: the Bitcoin blocksize was not increased). Very good info to get you caught up if you weren't around back then, or paying attention...'Mastering Bitcoin' is very good. Should be mandatory reading for every crypto investor, we'd be a lot better off. :P..Every book about Ethereum is dated the minute it's finished since it's always evolving, and it seems to happen at a faster pace with time. I'd love to read a book about its most recent roadmap: A Rollup Centric Ethereum, but one hasn't been written yet--by then Rollup's will be old news and I'll need a book about ZKEVMs....You can find a ton of writing on Vitalik's blog as he tries to condense the major points of what everyone's been doing.

It's what set the current state of Ethereum's evolution into motion. Not a book of course, but you'll have to find most info online anyway in posts like that if you want to get caught up...If you're starting out from no understanding you should read through the EthereumOrg/learn website.

If you want to learn how blockchain works with objective facts, this also covers Ethereum, watch this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA)...One problem is most of the "educational" material on crypto is very one-sided.  You should learn all sides of the issue.  Is Ethereum really de-centralized?  Is blockchain really capable of being a good way to verify authenticity?  The above link covers all that and more, and nobody has found any factual errors in it in the 3 years it's been out.

I've never understood how anyone prefers to learn using books. Actually just use the technology. Spend a day and try optimism, try sending and receiving to different addresses. Look at top dapps. Watch some youtube vids on architecture and consensus mechanism. Read about how people code different dapps or tools on Ethereum. if interested, try doing so yourself. Look at top GitHub repos Etc

Weird flex to say you don't read books...*Why* Ethereum is as important as *how to* Ethereum. You won't learn why from a shilly YouTube channel or from using it. Or you'll end up buying into some centralized scam chain's marketing and be none the wiser...Cryptography and cryptocurrency, smart contracts, economic sustainability, decentralization, cryptographic proofs, are all ludicrously heavy topics that require much more than a YouTube video or Git repo to properly explain. You can dumb anything down so a 5 year old could understand it by removing 99% of the details, but how well do you understand it at the end really?..Everything shorthand that you learn and find interesting is reason to find it thoroughly explained and fact-checked in a book...Books, long form reading generally, are absolutely fundamental to understanding this space clearly--at all levels. I never understood how anyone prefers to be told what a book says rather than reading the same book. Especially in crypto, where we of all people should be weary of any middleman's financial incentive or otherwise.

Because rewards follow a Power Law distribution. MOST blocks have pretty shitty rewards, so if you get a limited amount of blocks, you are likely to be closer to the median than the average. If you had infinite time and blocks, of course you'd be average, because EVENTUALLY you'd get a lottery block. But with a finite timeline and 2/3 blocks per year, you are better off socializing these rewards so you can have more access to lottery blocks...It's a bit better explained here: [https://twitter.com/Pol\_Lanski/status/1815311054731399478](https://twitter.com/Pol_Lanski/status/1815311054731399478)

Why do you get downvoted for this? It's my experience too, and of MOST participants. Of course if you get a lottery block you will socialize it and hence your ROI of the pool will be inferior at yours, but there's no way to know if you are going to be one of these very few that get lottery blocks.

What does staking mean?
0
Staking Ethereum means locking up your ETH to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return, you earn rewards in the form of more ETH. You need at least 32 ETH to run your own validator, but you can also join a staking pool (on Coinbase or sumn) if you have less. It’s a way to earn passive income while supporting the Ethereum blockchain...mostly from chatgpt

More ETH emitted than was burned.
74
Isn't this because 1) level two is taking off which 2) reduces on-chain transactions which 3) ultimately destroys less ETH causing it to become inflationary?..As I understand it, as long as adoption of level 2 continues like it is now, ETH will remain inflationary. Nice because it takes less gas to get something done on-chain, but sucks if you are using ETH as a speculative financial instrument.
15
ETH has this very elegant system built in where if it's not being used a lot, and just being staked/HOLDED, less will be burned (more inflation), making it more attractive to spend, whereas if a lot is being used, more will be burnt, to make it more attractive to HODL.. It's amazing.. It's almost as beautiful as BTC's balance of mining difficulty and hash rate to balance mining.
186
Scaling of L2 data availability has reduced fees, so temporarily the fee burn is less than issuance. This won't remain the case as L2 activity is growing fast. ...Even though the current inflation is "high" by post-merge Ethereum standards, it still remains lower than the current inflation rate of Bitcoin, gold (due to new mining), or any fiat currency.
8
Still ultra low inflation.
25
Ethereum is inflationary by design. New ETH must be created to pay validators...This wasn't an issue since the Merge, because the more activity there is, the more ETH are burnt (from gas fees being paid)...But since EIP-4844, the fees have greatly diminished. The activity has moved from L1 to L2s.  .But L2 fees, post EIP-4844 are super low, so you need A LOT MORE activity to compensate for the fact that gas is now much cheaper for users...
6
The EIP for blobs (4844, I think)
10
Not gonna lie, that site looks sexy, props to whoever coded it.
5
bc currently due to network activity being low, less being burned and as of the last few months it's been in a steady incline on being more inflationary ..but when network activity picks up, the rate of burn is usually faster than the rate of emissions so it offsets this
3
This is a great visual explaining the issuance and burn mechanisms https://ultrasound.money/..Since the merge, total burn is still greater than issuance
3
They have made it too cheap to use ETH. The fees should be somewhat similar to the inflation to make it a self sustaining network and not a Ponzi scheme.
2
because thats how ethereum works
2
To put this to into perspective: that's an increase of about 0.05% of the total supply.

7
The Nash equilibrium, this is what makes these systems so beautiful.
45
Thing is, do we ever really WANT it to be less attractive to use?..On the other hand, do ETH holder actually want there to be inflation?..Equilibrium is cool and all, but why not just use a cheap inflated L1 for applications and then hodl a coin without inflation like BTC?..These are genuine questions.
14
I really enjoy velocity models and The mathematics showing the curvature behind them. It is always pretty to look at...Eg. Hbar's price curve for its utility based velocity model showing token demand and increasing price based on its network useage in a fixed rate ecosystem... instead of traditional retail investors being the only source of network price action. Which feels more pyramid scheme than a practical investment. ..I always feel the creation of value > store of value. I think it might be a few years, but the world will agree in the end. ..Because a creation of value tokenmic can be a store of value, however a store of value tokenomic can never be a creation of a value ecosystem.
7
Yeah, ETH's got a pretty slick system. Self-balancing like that is pretty smart. Keeps things interesting for both users and hodlers. Crypto's come a long way with this kind of tech.
2
I'm curious; can it be circumvented big holders making transactions to themselves?

It is NOTHING like the difficulty adjustment. ..You're comparing a Nobel Prize worthy economic breakthrough to bog standard fiat-style manipulation tactic, lol.

Who cares if it’s currently just a tad below bitcoin. Bitcoin will have much lower inflation in the future. And how will increased activity on L2s increase Ethereum usage as all the activity is on the L2 and not Ethereum. I’ve never felt so disappointed in Ethereum in my life. Fees need to match inflation so it can be a sort of self sustaining network and not a Ponzi scheme
2
Can you explain a little more about why "This won't remain the case as L2 activity is growing fast"? I've been assuming that any time we see L2 activity, it's because someone replaced their corresponding L1 activity. Are you talking about a predictable increase of applications that use L2 on day zero?

2
Exactly. It surprises me how little people seem to know of the importance of creating a nash equilibrium if you want a stable organic system
12
No, it needs to be maximally attractive to use. And it is with the rollup centric roadmap. Use Base or Arbitrum or Optimism for cent fees...We want issuance to keep the chain secure forever. If the burn can’t keep up with issuance then yes, we want inflation...Bitcoin currently has more inflation than Ethereum...You don’t want to hold Bitcoin because that chain cannot stay secure when the block reward goes to zero.
3
Buterin has said that ETH grew too fast and so yes its possible that too many uses of the ETH system could degrade it to the point that everyone hates to use it or it gets too expensive to do anything on it. I still have game pieces of games that were fun to play on ETH but now it would cost thousands in fees to play them, for example. Many other things could just vanish if fees went infinite.

plleeeeease look into ethereum a little more
1
I mean L2 activity is growing fast - [https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity](https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity)..[The major L2s are more than 90% filling their purchased data blobs at present.](https://postimg.cc/mt8D8szh)..As L2 growth continues, L1 fees will have to increase again as the L2s compete with each other for data availability...As L1 fees rise, burn increases again...Low L1 fees and a paltry amount of inflation (still less than the inflation rate of BTC or gold) is the temporary "price" of further network scaling and usage expansion.
2
We had only 0.61% inflation in the last 30 days, and it is still "incredibly low" for a network as big as Ethereum. .Some of you guys literally only talk nonsense to spread FUD
26
Bitcoin inflation is ~0.85% per year currently...Emissions occur every block. Burning occurs every block. The balance between these two fluctuates with network usage...Bitcoin and Etheruem both need to pay for network security somehow and creating new BTC/ETH is how that's done.
9
Not even 1%. Also it goes to stakers. The staking yield is 3.5%, so as long as you’re staked, the inflation isn’t really harming you.
1
Im sure it was expected to some extent. Blobs are meant to decrease the L1 fees for L2 Rollups transactions. ..Lower fees = less burn, so I’m sure it was expected to some extent. I’m not sure if the change has been more or less than what was expected by the devs
4
Yeah but chain improvements made that so that the lower use means less gas, less gas means currency inflation. L2s working *too good?* lol
-5
Since blob update the burn was reduced. .The hope is that more demand comes since fees were cheaper so in total there will be net burn again eventually. No one knows but for L2s the blobs made their business more profitable so far.
8
The same reason it is still lower than Bitcoin's current inflation and having been quite deflationary for a good amount of time since the merge.
1
oh I thought that came from gas fees, makes sense.
5
Seems like it’s just make up whatever you want… isn’t this just like the us monetary system ?
2
Is it true that the maximum inflation rate for ETH is 0.77%?
2
🤣 Buterin… 😑

Right, they would be burning more than they'd save. Nevermind then.
3
Your coin has no value, lol
2
He thinks people who were more competent about storing their BTC a long time a doesn't count as a premine just because you had to either buy mining hardware or have lots of money and the initiaive to have stored it all this time.
4
So some guys make ethereum and pre mine alot of tokens for zero cost. They have gpu mining so all future eth has a cost to produce so if they would like more on top of their pre mined zero cost stash they would have to invest in energy rigs land. Instead they made the chain proof of stake killing the miners. Now they have the option to stake the eth and earn yield on their pre mine. They can also dump onto the market because alot of eth that people mined or paid fiat for is tied up earning eth that costs nothing to produce. Now I could go on the fact it's centralised and a select few can change the protocol. Or how proof of stake will always fail in the end and basically operates like fiat.
-4
Solana dex volume recently surpassed Eth. The price also reflects what the market thinks of Eth.
-6
You're not entirely wrong. There is a tip that is paid to validators as a part of the txn fee, but the gas fee itself is burned and a small amount of ETH is created and paid to the validators.
5
Might want to know how Eth works.  There is no hard cap for Eth. Infinite is printed. Eth gets burned every transaction. Hope more gets burnt than minted.
7
That is semi-correct. Its good to ask questions.
2
No, because it’s programmatic and changes to supply are controlled by the protocol.
1
It's not quite that simple, if there are more validators on the network then issuance is increased ever so slightly. But it's very little, 0.77% is the current maximum inflation rate with the current amount of eth staked...In general Ethereum is aiming for "minimal viable issuance" so it might be lowered in the future. It seems to be consensus that Ethereum generally does not need any more validators on the network as we already have enough economic security so the curve might eventually be changed to not incentivize more stake...ofc you have the burn to offset issuance so over the past two years total inflation has been -0.079%..the exact formula is here: [https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/)
2
It's not Buterin, it's Margarine! It's good for you, it's made.
1
Then why can I sell it? Why do I use it so much? Why do so many people take it as payment on their digital assets? Why is it the most used asset in DeFi?..If it really has no value, what does that say about *your* coin with its higher level of inflation, lower cost to attack, reliance on centralized Chinese manufacturing, no DeFi, no programmability, one solitary client implementation, that was abandoned by its founder?
1
How is the ratio determined?
1
There is a catch tho, fees are measured in real-world value, emission is a constant. So fee goes higher with inflation will eventually catch up with emission. So there is actually an invisible cap.
5
There is a hard cap. At zero transactions, we have maximum inflation. This is still lower than BTC’s current inflation rate.
1
Argue with time, nigga lol. 💁‍♂️
1
The issuance rate and the burn rate are independent. You can calculate the ratio, but the ratio isn't directly determined by any one thing...The ETH issuance rate is directly tied to the number of validators. The total ETH issuance is proportional to the number of validators. As the number of validators increases, the total reward pool also increases. However, the individual reward per validator decreases because the rewards are spread across a larger number of participants...When there are more validators, the total ETH issuance is higher because more validators are being paid. However, each validator earns less on average because the rewards are divided among more participants...Conversely, if there are fewer validators, the total ETH issuance is lower, but each validator earns more ETH individually because the rewards are divided among fewer participants...The Ethereum protocol adjusts rewards over time to ensure the network remains secure. If the number of validators drops too low, the issuance rate may increase to incentivize more validators to join, and vice versa...The burn rate of ETH is primarily influenced by the demand for block space, which is directly related to the activity on the Ethereum network...EIP-1559 introduced a base fee for transactions, which is burned (destroyed) rather than given to miners or validators. This means that a portion of the ETH used to pay transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation...The base fee is dynamically adjusted based on the demand for block space. When there is high demand (i.e., when more transactions are trying to be included in blocks), the base fee increases. Conversely, when demand is low, the base fee decreases...When network activity is high (e.g., during a surge in DeFi, NFT activity, or other on-chain events), more transactions are processed, and the base fee rises. As a result, more ETH is burned, increasing the burn rate...During periods of low activity, the base fee decreases, leading to a lower burn rate as fewer transactions are processed and less ETH is burned.
7
If you meant the ratio of the tip to the base fee, it's up to the user. If they want their txn included fast then they might tip a lot. If they aren't in a rush they might only tip a little.
1
Good point, but that assumes $/ETH keeps up with inflation. Hopefully it does…
-1
Time, eh? Let’s see the value of BTC over time, measured in ETH:.https://x.com/drmemebrain/status/1823717280687001869?s=46&t=m1Jlf0dojyC4eiPyQZXD5g..Maybe don’t look actually 🫣
1
You must misunderstood something...If ETH price go lower with inflation, tx fee goes higher in terms of ETH, burn goes higher...If ETH price go higher with inflation, well, then we don't have a problem...So this invisible cap works no matter what the market direction is.
1
I look at charts, not tweets, so I'm well aware that ETH hasn't printed a high against BTC since 2017, but unfortunately most ETH holders are too stupid to realize they're getting slow-rugged, lol...Congratulations, you played yourself.

BTC is more scarce..4. BTC is more decentralized..5. BTC hasn't changed monetary policy..6. BTC is more anti-fragile..7. BTC is more censorship-resistant..8. BTC has had more upside (and will continue to)..9. BTC has a higher market cap (because it's literally worth more)..10. BTC is accelerating the adoption of sustainable/renewable energy...BTC is superior in hundreds of other quantifiable metrics, but you (as an imbecile) will probably never have the mental bandwidth to comprehend a fraction of what makes it superior...Enjoy the poverty. 💁‍♂️
2
You’ve got me on 5 and 9. 10 is debatable. The rest are simply wrong...1. Ethereum is better money. It costs less to use L1, has working and widely adopted layer2s, and can natively do DeFi which means you can actually do something with your money, unlike BTC which relies on centralized services to do any basic money function besides “send” (loan, lend, swap, LP, etc)..2. Ethereum costs more to attack, and doesn’t have a looming supply crisis like BTC does. 51% attacks under PoW are *much* harder to recover from...3. Ethereum literally has a lower inflation rate than BTC...4. By node count, barely. By EVERY other decentralization metric, no. ETH has more core devs, more client implementations for resilience against bugs (BTC has had two critical inflation bugs!), wider coin distribution, no reliance on Chinese hardware manufacturers...5. Yet. It will have to one day though...6. See 4. BTC has got a lower uptime % than Ethereum that should say it all...7. They are equal, both need 100% censoring nodes to censor. But if you measure “avg delay time”, BTC is much more vulnerable...8. Why, its total addressable market is SO much smaller?..9. For now. The market can remain irrational as long as it likes...10. I actually agree with this to a degree, but idk if the balance overall will be negative due to mountains of junk ASICs...And what you don’t know is that I have been following Bitcoin since 2011, mined it in 2014, own Bitcoin myself with my own keys, relentlessly defend Bitcoin against the nonsense of nocoiners, and understand Bitcoin and its history better than 99.5% of Bitcoiners. It’s just not as holy as y’all make it out to be...Edit: and by the charts, BTC hasn’t posted a high against Ethereum since Ethereum’s launch. That’s what the tweet was pointing out. Thought you read charts, but maybe yours don’t go back that far?
1
1. Fiat gimmicks..2. PoS costs less to attack than PoW..3. Fiat gimmick..4. More devs because more to fix..5. False..6. ETH outage/bug frequency is higher..7. ETH @ the mercy of very few PoS validators..8. Total addressable market is higher (all store of value assets)..9. Forever..10. Recycling exists...Be prepared to watch the ETH component of your portfolio hemorrhage compared to your BTC holdings forever. At least you have made some better decisions than most in this sub.
1
DeFi is exactly the opposite of fiat gimmicks. Satoshi himself was working on an escrow function for Bitcoin in 2010, even before multisig support and other obvious features. You can read his emails, he knew how important DeFi would be, and would lament its absence today were he alive...Ethereum has thousands of validators (majority on residential ISPs), and decentralized staking pools w/ features Bitcoiners could only dream of for their mining pools...Ethereum has 100% uptime. It has never gone down. Bitcoin can’t say that...Store of value use case < all finance, plus all digital assets, plus all online accounts, all domain name systems, and all the other things you can program it to do like zk proofs to verify authenticity of photos and log the hash in realtime to avoid AI deepfakes, or decentralized identity, or decentralized social media…
1
I've read all Satoshi docs...Escrow is a legitimate payment mechanism...Staking, yield, interest loans, etc. are fiat gimmicks...ETH had 2 outages in 24 hrs just last year, so 100% uptime is false & a bug knocked out 8% of validators THIS year; it is not flawless...BTC will consume most real-world value & most of the other use cases you listed. ETH simply isn't that important, as evidenced by recent usage stats.
1
Ethereum has had numerous outages, stop lying. Nobody takes DeFi (staking, etc.) seriously. It's all talk and essentially a ponzi.
0
Name one outage. Show me the gap in block timestamps. I’ll wait...And I take DeFi seriously, it’s how I do ~80% of my banking now. Loans, savings, paying bills, you name it.
1
So I suppose that you don't consider not finalizing blocks an outage? Just a temporary hiccup?
1
Correct. Users wouldn’t even know it’s happening, and other blockchains like Bitcoin never even finalize at all.

Warpcast/Farcaster is a quality dapp. Kind of like Twitter, but less bots and more intelligent people. There are lots of different clients to choose from, each has totally different UX but renders the same content. Only dApp I would consider tackles 'real issues' considering how full of bots and censorship Twitter has gotten lately...OpCraft (Autonomous Worlds) was a proof of concept that replaced the Ethereum virtual machine with the game engine to Minecraft. That's turned into the Redstone protocol and there've been several more games deployed using it. If that's your thing, it's an interesting frontier to explore.

My top pick is DCA.Monster. It's an AMM that lets you stream swap, offering the best and most affordable DCA on-chain. It’s all about optimizing yields with non-liquidatable synthetic tokens, plus it has some other cool features! Powered by Cartesi’s Application Specific Rollup, it's also really close to its mainnet launch. Definitely worth a look...Another close favorite is BugBuster, a trustless bug bounty platform also powered by Cartesi rollups that just launched on the Optimism mainnet. It cuts out the middleman, making the process of validating exploits more decentralized. The first bounty focuses on the Solidity compiler v0.8.26, with a 4,000 CTSI reward to get things started.

You can use Coinbase if your in the USA to buy weekly, daily, monthly etc

Fill up an ethereum wallet with dai, write a script to buy eth on a dex and add a cronjob which fits your needs. if you want you can deposit the eth into maker and borrow some more dai to buy even more eth. but watch your liquidation threshold! eth can go with some dumps for sure down to 1,5k.

Balmy ( [balmy.xyz](http://balmy.xyz) ) is a good defi tool that allows you to DCA on-chain

Try to check out services like Gemini or Coinbase. They both offer recurring buy options for ETH.

Bitwage. Send your direct deposit paycheck to them and they will convert it into crypto for you. Non custodial, though, so you must provide a deposit address. I DCAed my smaller check into BTC and ETH for years.

summer.fi can do it for you on chain

You can do it entirely onchain with Definitive.fi. Get some USDC and deposit it onto your vault, then TWAP. You'll probably get better fees, and conversion compared to CEX.

I don’t think there’s an option to DCA with Advanced Trading, so you’ll be paying the higher fees. If you’ve got any programming experience, you can write your own program to do it with the advanced trading APi. I put $1000 per paycheck in to USD and my program breaks it up into buys every 12 hours until my next deposit.

Why coinbase one over kraken?  I am Us based
1
i’ve only had coinbase and i just stuck with it. i do stake with everstake on trezor though.
2
I’ve never used Kraken. Been with Coinbase since they opened up just about. Came from LocalBitcoins to Coinbase and just been using it ever since. I feel like Coinbase is the stronger platform just because that’s where most of the ETF funds are placed if I’m not mistaken.
2
Why did you choose everstake vs rocket pool and lido
1
“not your keys, not your coins” - both trezor and everstake are noncustodial and open-sourced (unlike ledger). i simply use trezor for cold storage and they partnered with everstake a few months ago and i decided to move everything off-chain and stake with trezor and everstake for convenience and security. before i was staking with coinbase but their apr was lower. iirc 2.6% on coinbase vs 3.7% on everstake, which is like $1000 annual difference. i DCA using coinbase one (fixed at $30 a month) and then, at the end of the month, transfer to trezor to stake with everstake. ..honestly i’m not the most well-versed in crypto and staking so take what i did with a grain of salt. if there is a more automated and secure way of buying and staking while keeping control of my keys, i’m open to it.
2
also wanted to add that i can’t stake more in coinbase since i’m in CA but Trezor and Everstake allows me to

I do felt though that the focus is a bit too centered on the price and the flippening etc. All the information is laid out around the price chart. I know that the price is definitely more central to the bitcoin community culture, but was not so for the core advocates and developers of the cypherpunk culture and the builders of the technology, and also for a lot of the ethereum community. The price is a result of speculative trading, and does not necessarily reflect an accurate measure of the value of the technology being created. I think a visualization such as yours that goes into all the information, would be served better if it went beyond focusing on the asset price as the central element.

It's a waste of your time AND money...If it was so fast and cheap to generate private keys that contain funds, they would not be selling the service. I know I would not. And I am a charitable person.
33
Sites that encourage you to look up a private key may be taking that key and stealing your coins. Other than that I think they are kind of interesting...Note that these sites are not what they appear to be. They appear to have a list of all addresses and their private keys, but they do not. It is trivial to lookup the addresses associated with a page full of private keys, but to store the addresses for all 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 private keys is not currently possible.
11
If you generate your keys online you’re going to get hacked. Whoever generates that seed for you can keep it and monitor its addresses with full access. Keys are ideally generated offline, thus tools like Trezor and Ledger.
8
If you find a Bitcoin wallet address with BTC inside, may as well go for it...If you find a Ethereum wallet address with anything inside, 99.999999999%+ odds it's a honeypot. These are designed to automatically siphon your ETH out once you deposit enough gas to afford the blockspace to empty it....I like showing people keys.lol whenever they believe crypto keys are easy to crack. It's an educational tool, nothing more. However, you may have noticed the first few pages (or pages like 696969, 123456, etc.) do show activity or a wallet balance, just so you know those are the honey pots I'm referring to...You can generate keys blazingly fast with any modern PC offline in a secure environment. But the odds of you finding one that's ever been in use during the next trillion years is zilch. You have better odds at winning the Powerball 6 times in a row than picking $5 out of any crypto wallet. (Caveat - any crypto wallet that's been generated properly using sufficiently random seeds; if a user manually selects 1 3 5 7 9 as their private key it's on them when it gets found by others)...Anyone selling a service offering to use their resources for an impossible task is guaranteed to be a scam. It wouldn't shock me to find out they hardcoded a method of detecting and emptying any wallet they did find with a balance while showing you $0, seeing as they're clearly ethically bankrupt already, even considering how unlikely that feat is to occur between now and the heat death of the universe..

>claim to generate ..sure. that's trivial..>or find Ethereum private keys..scam.

Yes, there exists websites where you can find every private key. But good luck finding one with a balance, lol.

Yes, but probability low

The actual number of all potential private keys is incomprehensible to type in decimal...If the number he gave was the actual number they'd all be cracked in no time :p

It’s not a database of all possible keys. Only an idiot who doesn’t understand math thinks that’s possible. Even Google can’t store every key. It generates for you based on the page you go to. You’ll never guess a single key. You can waste months trying (and many have) only to generate nothing. As a bonus, the service that’s checking the keys, will likely dump any key it really finds before you can try.

It’s not a database. You can just sort it for addresses with activity if it was a database. It’s generated when you hit the page.

That is the full actual number of valid Bitcoin private keys..10^78..There are 10^82 atoms in the visible universe for reference...A few orders of magnitude less than the total quantity of atoms is still a *very large number* and physically impossible to crack or brute force. Using traditional computing (ie non quantum), even using stars as fuel for billions of years you would not make it one thousandth the way through...You can calculate the circumference of the visible universe to the accuracy of less than the width of a hydrogen a atom with 38 digits of pi. Why have people calculated pi to over 31 trillion digits?? For the same reason people have typed out numbers over 82 in length on their keyboard, why you have personally seen numbers go into thousands in length. It's not at all because it's useful.
1
That number is 2^(256), but the actual number of private keys is slightly less because a very small fraction of 256-bits numbers (including 0) are not valid private keys.

Sounds like a scam in the making
15
Hi, follow these steps and you’ll be good ..1. **Use an Exchange:** Sign up on a trusted crypto exchange like Coinbase or Kraken...2. **Receive USDT:** Get your USDT deposit address from the exchange and share it with your friend...3. **Convert to USD:** After receiving USDT, trade it for USD on the exchange...4. **Withdraw to Bank:** Transfer the USD to your linked bank account...No need to worry about IRS stuff in this case!
11
In the US you have to claim any crypto gift you receive. The person gifting it doesn’t have to report any thing under $17k.
1
Best to ask your bank if they have a option to transfer crypto to cash
1
To actually answer you question with specifics, if you have Coinbase you can do the following entirely without any fees: Receive USDT -> convert to USDC -> withdraw to bank.
1
So to avoid currency conversion and transfer fees he wants to pay gas fees and then have you pay the fee to convert the USDT to fiat.  Sounds efficing stupid.
-2
Worth noting that there is no evidence anyone has successfully redeemed USDT for USD. The barriers put in place by Tether are insurmountable. ..You'll need to find someone on an exchange who will swap USD with you instead.
-6
It’s a trusted friend so I know it’s not a scam, but if you wouldn’t mind elaborating, how would this be a scam? Im only receiving money, not providing any of my own money
3
You must report it to the IRS. I would save some of it for tax season. Luckily exchanges make it easy to submit tax info

1
Just don’t use any site they may send you. Your own eth address or exchange you already use will work. There is a common scam like this where they bait people into signing up to a scam exchange. One there you need to pay a fee to get the money etc
11
A trusted friend as in a friend you know in person for at least a couple of years and he told you in person that he wants to gift you a few thousands of USDT?..**Assuming that all these check out and it is legit**, just create a new wallet in metamask, add polygon network (or any L2s) and ask him to send you on the network of your choice. If need be, ask him to bridge it over...Then send the received USDT to the off-ramp platform (usually CEX) and cash out as needed...With Travel Rule regulations for most legit CEX, you need to own the wallet from which you are receiving crypto to avoid complications...Don't use any platform your "friend" as you to use and you should be safe...Stay safe.
2
For gifts from foreign persons, you only have to report if it's over $100,000. See: irs.gov/businesses/gifts-from-foreign-person..In general, you don't pay tax on gifts received. The person giving the gift is responsible for paying the tax if it's over a certain threshold.
5
Oh yeah, $100k minimum is claimed. And a whole lot of other admin hoops to jump through...No one's ever provided proof they've done it though...(Some make the claim but can't prove it.)..It's wild.
-1
Yeah known the friend for more than 10 years. He said just needs anything I have that can receive through TRC20 or ERC20.
1
I understand I don’t have to report the “gifting” part, but what about the “selling” part when I trade USDT for USD?
2
Is there really a tax on foreign person even if the gift is exceedingly large, say 1 million? If I understand correctly IRS cannot tax the foreign person and OP would only need to report the transaction and not necessarily pay tax for it. ..I am curious how they distinguish a legit gift vs compensation from a secret job (eg sugar baby)
1
Ok, then for safety sake, just use erc20 token...For the amt you are receiving, the gas fee is miniscule in comparison. Or if you are not in a rush, send it to your cex account during the weekends when gas is lower. It's pretty low these days anyway...Again, stay safe. :)
1
The cost basis would be what your friend paid for the USDT (presumably $1/USDT), so you'll have 0 gain or loss when you sell for USD, so no capital gains to report.
1
I'm not really sure. You'd think there would be serious scrutiny of large foreign gifts for various reasons, but I have no clue what that scrutiny would look like.

Ethereum has 1/6 the inflation of BTC and is both more secure and affordable. How sound does it really need to be, if as a consequence it becomes unusable to all but the uber wealthy?..Once there are more Rollup's, the fee market for Blobspace will pick up and the burn will increase...Alternatively, there's lots of serious talks about reducing staking yields which would reduce the amount of issuance across the board. Ethereum's whole schtick is 'minimum viable issuance' and there's good reason to believe the network is overpaying for security now. Such as the $$ amount to attack the network is far greater than Bitcoin currently, also just the % of ETH being staked (which could otherwise be used for more productive uses, like providing liquidity in dApps)...We had what, 5000 L1's emerge last bull cycle? All relied on unsustainable inflation to prop up their network. Most were 1:1 forks of Ethereum using its EVM only with an increased blocksize. ~99% failed once new supply outpaced buyers leading to insecure networks, and a tremendous loss of user funds...This is what makes crypto shit, what people hate about it. Because most people aren't privvy enough to tell what's actually sustainable or just BS marketing before the worst happens to them, leaving a sour taste in their mouth forever. Same thing when people got into Ethereum then were hit with a $200 gas fee to withdraw $180 from their wallet. ..Eventually those 5000 new chains will all be L2's. They will cost less to maintain therefore be more sustainable and profitable to manage (meaning the market incentive today is to launch as an Ethereum L2 rather than a new L1), and in the worst case if or when they fail user funds will not be lost due to the nature of Rollup's (user assets always persist on Ethereum). That is the future with 4844, not 5000 competing chains but 5000 symbiotic chains ideally with cross-chain bridges abstracted in the background...Besides, Ethereum is POS. Much of its ~0.5% inflation is likely going back into staking and not entering circulation as sell pressure. It's a different formula than POW anyway, which requires market selling to be sustainable.
58
The root cause is not EIP-4844, it is L2 operators don't burn transaction fees overpaid by the users...L2 pay fees to blobs, but it is not the exact same amount L2 users paid to L2 operators. L2 provides a limited TPS just like L1. Users bid gas price to get their transaction included. However, there is no reason for the accepted bid to be equivalent or close to the fees L2 pays to blobs, meaning the difference between these two fees become profit for L2 operators. L2 operators actually make more money by providing less TPS to increase the difference...Assume the fee L2 pays for blob is A (per transaction). The fee users paid to L2 is B. The profit (per second) L2 operators get is:..(B-A)\*TPS..B decreases when TPS increases, because higher TPS means cheaper transactions. But in a normal market, B\*TPS always increases when TPS increases (It is impossible that you make too many products and tank the price to a point that your revenue decreases). That incentivizes the operator to make TPS as high as possible...However, in L2, the equation has this -A term, everything changed. First thing we noticed is, TPS can never increase to a point where B = A, because that means no profit or even negative profit. Second, there is a TPS that has the highest profit, L2 operators have no reason to run at a TPS higher than that...For example: B = 1/√TPS, A = 0.1..The profit become (1/√TPS-0.1)\*TPS..The TPS that maximizes this equation is 25, so there is no reason for L2 to run higher than 25 TPS in this model...This leads to L2 operators intentionally limit TPS and therefore use less blob space, burn less blob fees (even when demands are high)...**Possible Solution**..The solution I'm thinking is to limit how much fee L2 operators can keep based on the fees they paid to blobs. For example, L2 operators can only keep 1.5x the fees paid to blobs. If a transaction's blob fee is $0.001, but the user paid $0.01, L2 operators can only keep $0.0015 (so profit is $0.0005), and burn $0.0085...Under this settings, L2 operators are incentivized to increase TPS to a point where tx fee = 1.5\*blob fee...The parameter 1.5x should be dynamic and let the market decide. L2 that keeps less fees will consequently have higher TPS (because of the math explained above), therefore cheaper fees for users. So market will naturally lean towards L2 that uses more blobs, and increase the burn.
15
In 2 years we will have 10x more l2 on Ethereum. Imagine that now every block we have 1-2 blobs. Then it will need 10-20 blobs per block. Max blobs per block is 6, so the fee market will be competitive.

It's barely less inflation than BTC now. :(..I feel like being ultrasound money and low inflation or even deflationary was one good thing we could hang our hat on going into the bull market.  And it was something normal people could understand.  Blobs took that away and all of the value accrual is going to a universe of L2s...March 13, 2024 was when EIP-4844 launched and things haven't been the same since.  Yes, fees are a little lower but that is useless if no one is using Ethereum at all and using other chains.  It's no secret that in crypto the value of your token matters.  There are tons of crypto tokens that work great but no one uses them because the value of the coin torpedoed.  I don't want ETH to see that fate.
-20
BTC inflation is solved by halvings.
2
I recently read another doubt: If one L2 become successful, they will no longer be loyal to ETH, why should all L2 operators working for L1, instead of running their own ecosystem?..In a central bank and commercial banks based setup, there is centralized governance, but on blockchain there is none
2
>Ethereum has 1/6 the inflation of BTC and is both more secure and affordable...Have you checked ultrasound money lately?  I included the link in the title....Supply..ETH 0.713%/year..BTC 0.833%/year..ETH POW 4%/year..Honestly the responses I got to my question really scare me, no one had any good ideas and just want to hand wave it all away as "everything is fine."  I see why Ethereum has been underperforming so much this cycle with visionaries like these on board.  I don't hate ETH, I love ETH and I hate seeing it not becoming what we had hoped.  I, and many others signed up for on-chain sharding.  That was the way forward.  I have no idea why that was ever removed other than that they didn't know how to implement it.  L2s are not working for anyone except the owners of L2 chain parasites.  It's a user experience nightmare and besides that it is annihilating the ultrasound money aspects of Ethereum.
1
Reducing TPS is a way to make more money, and a way to get out performed by other L2s. I am not sure it is a problem in the current highly competitive L2 market. It might become one though if/when the market setles to a single L2
2
If you limit in on L2 the same shit will happen again on L3...Shouldn't it be generic?

with PoW we spent way too much on security and had way less of it, plus no finality.

Can you give a few examples of this marketing? ..Miners provide sell pressure, why would they increase the price?

I guess I’m confused, you mention all the L2s but then say nobody is using ETH. How can both those things be true? It’s usage, I guess just not directly on chain usage like you want?
11
You're gonna love the next halving then, where Bitcoin inflation falls below ETH again. ETH will never win. Just dump it.
1
The security budget is what's getting halved on Bitcoin though, exponentially at that. Its inflation is ~99% the incentive for people to expend costly energy doing POW...Halvings are mathematically not sustainable esp with the still handicapped small blocksize. Chances are the chain is forked in some years without the 21M max supply using more inflation to maintain security, fees maintain $1000+ pricing anyone who's not uber wealthy out of the network or self custody, or it forks as proof of stake, or all BTC will become insecure and worthless...>The BTC security budget is solved by halvings..This is not exactly a solution. It's merely kicking the can down the road to someone else...Exponential: every 10 halvings reduces Bitcoin's security budget by 99.9% or 9999/10,000. If the budget is $25M today it will be $2,500 in 35 years. Or else each one BTC has to be worth 10,000x more to offset the reduced security budget and maintain POW incentives, but by then the $25M budget would be used to secure a ~$200 quadrillion dollar market cap which then necessarily has to become worth ~$400 quadrillion just a few years later all to maintain $25M in POW.
2
Xmr already had to drop the halving concept because it’s not sustainable
2
That line of thinking doesn't seem very obvious to me. Why not be loyal to ETH?..It will likely always be cheaper to pay for ETH blockspace and have its millions of decentralized nodes securing your network than to pay for millions of nodes on your own. Lower cost means L2 operators can pocket the difference directly as profit. It would be a bad business move to step away from this seemingly to no benefit...Sort of the whole point of L2's is they can run on dozens of centralized nodes, offering the benefit of centralized scaling, while inheriting the decentralization of the base layer. Those dozens of nodes alone could not be trusted themselves. With any more nodes plus scaling in place costs go up dramatically, typically in the form of inflationary incentives which depresses the coin's price typically into a death spiral...It would take 1 bridge hack or 1 L1 exploit to tell the market not to value a forked-into-L1 network as much as an L2. An L2 to me means consumer protection exists, some central governance abstracted in the form of fraud proofs designed to be executed by trustless L1 validators...For that to succeed it would have to be a better 'money' than ETH itself.. Which will be difficult to do with high inflation. I'd rather hold ETH long term above all others so I'm a lot more comfortable depositing it into apps and offering liquidity which fuels the ecosystem. Liquidity begets more liquidity and that's a difficult thing for new coins to overcome, seen in all the other L1's like ADA or DOT or SOL or whichever that have single percentage points of TVL held compared to ETH or its L2's...I think at first L2's will absorb other L2's. Suppose it costs $5 to buy a blob today, basically any L2 with any basic compression scheme is able to launch and be profitable. Then one day if it costs $500 just the L2s with the most advanced compression and greatest demand can roll up enough transactions to remain both competitive and profitable. The $5 L2 will have to deploy as an L3 part of this more successful L2, something Optimism and Arbitrum seem to have thought of already when building their Superchain/Orbit networks. Beyond this future I still do not see even the most successful L2 launching as an independent L1, considering the cost/security/liquidity/centralization implications I mentioned above. ..Same argument 'why not' could be said about dApps too. Why doesn't Uniswap fork as a competing L1?..But who knows. I wouldn't bet one way or the other today. Crypto is always evolving. Time will tell!
2
1/6 measured in dollars. If you're worried about the dollar price then look at the dollar supply...ETH was never supposed to be deflationary, that was not the purpose of the fee burn. Deflation was always just a side effect of egregiously high fees, and the aim of that is to incentivize less activity. Why disincentivize Ethereum's activity for no reason otherwise?..Why do you think ETH has to be deflationary for it to preform well, considering as you mention inflation was 4% before at the ATH?..You say 0.70% per year but it is actually measured to be -0.05% per year over the last 2 years. As per UltrasoundMoney. No need to use the past 7d to extrapolate a year average rather than simply looking back 1-year with how volitile gas is...There's some 30x the amount of transactions per second taking place on L2's than is possible on L1. How is that not working for anyone? How are these L2's parasites when they're paying for blockspace in ETH and some of the largest burners of ETH?..Optimism is upgrading right now so every L2 part of its Superchain is composable with one another. Zora, Base, Optimism, plus 26 others. Polygon has something like this with their AggLayer too. The UX gets better as time passes. The end stage is every L2 is composable with every other. If you'd prefer to stay on L1 and pay $20-200 for a 'better UX' you're still absolutely free to do so. Bridging across L2's today is miles ahead the UX trying to interact back and fourth from Polkadot and Solana or any two L1's.
2
I don't have the exact number, but from what I heard, the current L2s make at least 10 times the fee they paid to L1. That's why they are not burning ETH. So the competition is definitely not solving the problem...I don't think it is a lack of competition problem, it is just anyone increase TPS will result in everyone lose profit, including themselves, as the equation shows.
2
I don't think L3 is a scaling solution that takes fee away from L2. My guess is it's like an application layer or abstraction layer.
2
But it was worth more for whatever reason.......when it was POW.

But ETH has been deflationary while the price has not recovered as well as Bitcoin.   You can't say that POW has nothing to do with it.

I think you havent thought that through..Being deflationary (as opposed to being inflationary) actually increases the value of ETH because it gets more and more scarce..So:.Price + because ETH is deflationary..Price - because high interest rates and bad macroecomic outlook.

So why is it not keeping pace with BTC?  Bitcoin had a new high a LONG time ago now....The only reason could be that it changed to POS.

> everything has it's own new word and meaning, and it's all purposely done to be as confusing as possible, so you have to spend a ton of time only on their thing..The reason you hear lots of new terminology coming from Ethereum is because it's community are building new tech...There are vastly more developers working in the Ethereum.ecosystem than on any other crypto, so it shouldn't be surprising that they are pushing out a lot of new ideas and features:..https://www.developerreport.com/..In fact, by looking at where new code is first deployed (i.e. novel, not just copy-pasted projects) you can see that 71% of all new developments in the whole of crypto happen first on Ethereum:..https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=71-of-contract-code-is..That is more than twice the innovation that happens on every other ecosystem combined... so yea, of course they will be coming up with new words and meanings!

I don't know much about this particular exchange but perhaps a more pertinent question is why they are not responsive. Personally, I think if you do not have insight into your current position because the exchange is not disclosing whether you are in a staked position or not, then you should consider moving it to an exchange that gives you a clearer picture. Why take extra unnecessary risks?
3
The risk of losing ETH by a slashing event or something is pretty low but not zero. If you're using the software normally it should never happen, but occasionally people have managed to get slashed by getting too clever with failover systems and things...I would be very surprised if the Japanese regulator would allow an exchange to stake your coins without your permission then not reimburse you if it lost them. I expect that SBI would reimburse for their screw-up you even if you'd opted into staking, but I'm not certain...That said if support won't answer your questions I'd use another exchange. Also consider just withdrawing your coins instead of leaving them on an exchange.
2
Don't use exchanges.  Not your keys, not your coins.
2
They staked your funds before you consented, keeping the revenue for themselves. When you opt out, they continue staking, and keep the revenue. They can't unstake yours because it's likely pooled with everyone else's funds...You shouldn't use a third party. Take custody and use a hardware wallet.
1
Thanks. Email and chat failed. I have reserved a phone call with support next week.
1
Thanks. I am a crypto beginner and only intend to invest a tiny part of my overall portfolio. I'm therefore happy to keep my coins on an exchange rather than in a wallet, but I am just frustrated that the SBI VC Trade support seem so incompetent (or obfuscating?) that they won't answer my question. When I take on risk, I want to know a) how great it is, and b) who bears the burden when shxx hits the fan. SBI operates the largest online brokerage in Japan and should be above board.....By "If you're using the software normally it should never happen" do you mean me personally, or the exchange that stakes on my behalf, or the validator that the exchange uses?..I don't do anything fancy. All I do is just buy and hold the Ether for the long term for a bit of asset diversification.

I’ll ask about this. I don’t invest much in crypto but I at least want them to tell me if it’s as you say.

Check out DAI, might be what you want.
30
DAI itself cannot be frozen, but a lot of the collateral which backs it could be frozen or confiscated by authorities, which could cause a loss of peg. Not a perfect solution, but better.
11
Your request seems like a contradiction at its core.  If you want something truly not exposed to censorship as you call it, it’s not a stable coin you are looking for.   You will have to take the price risk of a non stable coin because stable coins themselves are linked to fiat currency and thus are necessarily connected to the system you seem to want to avoid.
4
The people behind USDT have a history of fraudulent behaviour, don't keep your money in it regardless of your censorship risk...If you're likely to be targeted for censorship I'd use DAI or RAI or something instead of one of these though.
4
LUSD, BOLD when v2 is released later this year. Backed by only decentralized assets...DAI used to be a good choice, but long term Maker is moving away from it. Also backed by centralized assets...USDC and USDT both have admin features, so that's a no go.
12
Go with DAI.

this probably isn't the best way to research, looks like a lot of advertising in these comments.

The only fungible crypto tested against censorship is Monero, even if not stablecoin the price is very stable. You can buy in a decentralized way with Haveno, there is a beta of atomic swaps to Ethereum including L2.

Any of them that you have in self custody are the safest. If you hold them on an exchange it's never safe and never going to be...If the stables go to shit you will have more to worry about than your crypto because most likely markets have followed and chaos has ensued.

Many are saying DAI, but due to PSM existing DAI is dependant on USDC and USDT. The two mainsteam truely decentralized stablecoins are LUSD and RAI, but both have huge downsides. Liquity was fucked by Maker DSR and resulted in redemptions happening at like 350% CR, and RAI has shit liquidity. Currently USDC is the most stable stablecoin, at least untill Liquity V2 comes out.
1
You can't freeze DAI itself, but the government could freeze or take away a lot of the security that backs it, which would mean that the peg would be lost. It's not great, but it's better.

Hey feds? Yeah, its this guy right here.

DAI, LUSD, Frax and USDE.....

DAI

If censorship-resistance and untouchable backing are your priorities, then LUSD is the only answer. ..Everything else can be fucked with by the govt.

Rai if you are keeping under $50k as the market cap is lower for Rai. It was supposed to be roughly pegged to pi (3.14)...Use dai if you’re going to hold larger amounts .

Nothing on Ethereum is safe against censorship and fund freezing, especially if you use metamask

Checkout the eUSD RToken from the reserve protocol. Fully backed and insured against depegs

“I’m about to do illegal things which would make the US government take action against me and freeze my assets” dude probably not worth it
-3
MonkeysuffrageCoin is launching soon, it can't be frozen and it's completely decentralized in the sense that it's not backed by *Jack Squat.*
-9
Maker (issuer of DAI) is apparently changing things up and going to offer different versions of DAI, calling one version pureDAI...Anyways, we'll see how that shakes out.
5
To be honest that's a risk inherent to any stable coin. By their nature they have to refer back to tradfi somehow.
3
In theory though, couldn't someone start a protocol designed to report suspicious funds, that can then be sent to other defi protocols in order to block transactions involving those coins? Similar to how casinos share info on banned customers, couldn't a significant number of blue chip defi's start requiring this? Unless a privacy chain like Monero can implement a stable coin, which is not on the table currently, I don't see how it's possible to have a censorship resistant stablecoin, especially on a standard EVM chain...That said, DAI is the answer.
1
RAI is cool. I have doubts that a truly decentralized stablecoin can be pegged to a government currency without collapsing. so RAI isn't really pegged to anything, it just uses a mechanism to have low volatility. it likes to hover in the $2.75 to $3.00 range.
1
LUSD for the win
2
[effacé]
2
Not sure why you're being downvoted. The blockchain is public and transparent. Nothing is stopping well known defi platforms from caving to regulators, or imposing their own censorship (not that they would really care, other than to protect from liability).
3
Why is that? is there a specific explanation for this?
1
How is a wallet software (front-end) has anything to do with censorship or fund freezing?
1
You always have oracle risk, but you only risk the collateral getting rugged if the collateral is centralized. Originally DAI only used ETH which avoids this risk.
1
Some stablecoins are backed by crypto, like ETH.  Pretty hard to confiscate ETH.
1
Looking forward to their v2
2
in which case id just have to split between usdc and tether but i dont think there will be an obvious top to btc from here, 2021/2022 caught everybody out, two distribution tops, i bet this time it'll be vastly more complex, multiple fakeouts..for me btc is a perma hold, never to be traded just shaved off when i need the buy things
1
Maybe maximalism? Who knows... this is true, it is also true that for widespread acceptance or even for you to be able to dump into fiat in peace, there has to be regulation and by definition, AML has to have mechanisms to block or freeze assets, as if people haven't seen stories in the news of crypto assets being frozen and confiscated
1
I don't think you know how DeFi works. Smart contract can't be modified. Admin key can only set value, can't change function. Some contract has blacklist built-in, so they can add user to the blacklist with admin key...If the smart contract doesn't have blacklist to begin with, nothing can be done to censor user. If the admin key is destroyed, same thing, impossible to censor user...Uniswap v2 destroyed admin key, so there is at least 1 example that a defi platform is uncensorable.
1
When the wallet is made by the same company that provides the majority of the RPC endpoints, there is access to all transaction data. When the points are joined, legal enforcement takes care of the rest. I thought you were schooling us all on Defi...
1
How can you peg a coin to USD if you use ETH as collateral though? You still need an oracle to tell you what ETH is worth in USD and your currency can become wildly unbacked if ETH fluctuates in USD value.
2
UST. Never again.
0
Okay, how is legal enforcement gonna do if they wanna censor me, and they have metamask's help, but 51% of the validator, which has nothing to do with metamask don't want to censor me?
1
They can hold all Uniswap developer in hostage. Point a gun on them, "censor him on Uniswap v2 or die". They literally couldn't do anything, they can only choose die.
1
Who said you have to (or even should) make a stablecoin pegged to inflationary fiat?  People need to stop thinking in terms of dollars but that will require a huge paradigm shift or at the very least widespread crypto adoption.
2
You still need an oracle, that's what I said. To use ETH as collateral you require more collateral than the DAI (or whatever) that it backs, then you hope that the ETH price doesn't drop so fast that all the ETH gets liquidated and there still isn't enough to back the DAI. This did actually work with the original DAI through some fairly massive ETH price crashes.
1
UST is an algorithmic stable backed by endogenous collateral...Stablecoins like LUSD is over collateralised and backed by exogenous collateral...Huge difference.
2
Bro, we're not talking about taking over a blockchain. We're talking about freezing the assets in an account, which doesn't require consensus in any way.
1
Yeah, actually that's not the case and they wouldn't point the gun on uniswap genius, they would do it on the custodial platform used to offramp since no one actually uses crypto as a means of exchange... then again you're laughing now but the tornado cash developer is in jail because of the same situation you describe
1
[effacé]
-3
It does require consensus to freeze my fund. I sign a transaction with my private key and send it. The only possibility it can't get through is if 51% of validators are against me. (actually 33% but the idea is the same)
1
And tornado cash contract still working, there is nothing they can do to stop it. We were talking about DeFi, and your argument is custodial platform? How is custodial platform DeFi?
1
No, it's different to Terra because with Terra the collateral was their own token, which is obviously prone to a death-spiral because if Terra is starting to lose its peg then it's clearly a shitty stablecoin so Terra is worthless. This design obviously doesn't work, but that doesn't seem to stop somebody from trying it once every bull market...The original DAI and things like RAI don't have this problem because the value of the collateral is independent of the stablecoin.
2
No, it doesn't. If the source contract makes the token non transferable or the underlying value is gone, then it doesn't matter if you sign the tx or not, you're left with a worthless asset in your wallet and for all intents and purposes, it's as good as gone. .But yes, as far as the textbook is concerned, it can't be transferred unless you sign it.
1
No, we were talking about stablecoin censorship and you had to ackchyually us with your defi knowledge. No one cares about Uniswap and it's not even relevant to the point being made. If you don't believe it has a back door, it's your prerogative.
1
The source contract need to have a function to make the funds non transferable. If it didn't have that function since the beginning, the dev can't add it afterwards. It is forever uncensorable.
1
Oh so "everything on Ethereum" actually means stablecoin only, and apparently DAI doesn't have blacklist, and the dev can't add it afterwards (see? the defi knowledge matters now), your biased take doesn't even apply to all stablecoins.

I didn't realise Coinbase wallet ran their own staking pool. I assumed they acted as a go between for Lido and other pools. None of them are cast iron, but the risks are well documented...Running a validator has its own risks and it's hard to compare the two.
5
There is no such thing as "no risk" anywhere in the world of crypto.
5
Running your own validator comes with the risk of slashing. There's no completely risk free to stake. Frankly Coinbase seems to be the least risky option, so that's where I stake. I use Coinbase advanced instead of the wallet, but I'm not sure if there's any difference though
2
I run my own validator on my windows PC, just added another one and got a 0.08 ETH block 2 days after it's online. First time it's scary, but the actual steps only took around 5 minutes...PS: I already have a synced node, syncing node takes about 1 day, computer work, you don't need to do anything.
2
Just get a mix of liquid staking coins. The value of the stake is priced in and you can hold them in any wallet or quickly sell them on a DEX.
2
Running your own validator is an option, but it’s tricky. For less risk, check out Valinity’s reverse staking—earn rewards while keeping your assets liquid and secure.
1
Solo stake. It is the only "safe" way....You can still screw up and get slashed, but that's on you....Despite being more than sufficiently techy I chose Rocketpool so I could retain custody but leverage a large community to debug platform issues so I don't have to. I have had a good experience so far. ...The trade-off is that the RPL token required for collateral exposes you to some risk.
1
Wait why would coinbase stop supporting coinbase wallet?
1
I use kiln in paris since 1 year. I have 1 validator and some ether left in their pool. no problem.
1
You can run your own node if you have 32 ETH
1
have you tried coinsxyz? I recently tried it and so far having a smooth exp with it
1
why would they stop supporting coinbase wallet? if you are being concerned, maybe try using another platform. coinsxyz is what me and my friends use.
0
With RocketPool software?
2
The value is priced into RocketPool's rETH.  You don't earn a yield from Lido's stETH until you exit the smart contract.  Either way, if either of those platforms goes under so do your rewards & underlying investment.  There is risk in everything.
1
The chance is slim but anything is possible.  A better question is why would you trust your decentralized assets to a greedy corporation in the first place?

all EVM chains have a chain ID already..https://chainlist.org/..this proposal requires literally nothing to change about any EVM network. it only impacts wallets and nothing else.

wallets need more idiot-proofing. in the government currency world it is not possible to send an ACH transaction to a SEPA address nor is it possible to accidentally transfer euros to a person who expects dollars. that's the standard we are being held to and we are beneath that standard right now.
3
oh so your saying only the wallet level.  .  .You can't send funds from 1 network to another one without a bridge.  .So why would a wallet need this? Even if i could identify what chain ID target i want i still need a bridge for it.
1
this is very true, I'm not an expert on the topic but i think in general contracts/signatures are way too confusing and need to be more intelligible eventually if we really want billions of people using crypto

I disagree the entire point in this industry was to be smart, independent, and responsible.  If you can’t be that, then please don’t participate in it.  Thats what banks are for.  Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper.

Yeah… the point is for the wallet to support bridges but OP suggests having a “swift” like protocol that different wallets can support for automation of a multi chain transaction..I think it already exists but companies lack the initiative
2
you can achieve idiot proofing without sacrificing independence and things like self-custody. you're insane if you think wallet UX is in the right place right now and everyone who isn't satisfied with wallet UX should leave.

Yes that exists and it's not implemented in the format of the OP since bridges aren't fully decentralized.

It's trivially easy to recover--literally just add the token to any Ethereum-compatible wallet to interact with it. The problem is you're not in a position to do so since the funds are in Binance's wallet. So the answer is, there's a 100% chance of recovering your funds **but** Binance has to actually take the steps to recover them. I expect they will, and if they drag their feet you should definitely keep bugging them, but the key point is that technical feasibility =!= practical inclination.
17
This kind of mistake isn’t uncommon, and Binance might be able to help since you’ve already submitted an appeal. The $200 fee is a bit steep, but it could be worth it if they can recover your stETH. I hope for a quick resolution!
4
Or you can wait for steth listing on binance
2
i mistakenly transferred wUSDT to Binance once and lost it, around $50. contacted binance support, they said recoverable but processing is complex and might take upto $500 to do it. i let it go and made my peace.
1
it would be easy for wallets to begin baking the network ID and token ID into addresses. the address would tell you "hey, I only take this one currency on this one network, don't send anything else!" and when you paste it into your wallet software it would stop you from doing what you're not supposed to do. the network itself doesn't even to know.
-1
I have this issue with cbet. They never wanted to help me. Is there anyone successfully recovered wrong chain/token from cbet?
0
That’s why people should not use binance: not you wallet, not your tokens.
-2
I actually did this before. I don't remember the currency but it was something Binance could access but support wanted a fee paid in BTC to reverse the transaction. I said fuck it, let it burn.
7
I don't get it. The eth address is linked to a eth wallet. Sending wrong token on that address will just send steth to unknown address then to oblivion. How is it possible to get it back ?
-1
Update they recovered my 1,82 steth. Lucky.
2
You have to go through an exchange to cash out. Use your brain instead of just shouting platitudes...Edit:  I’m an asshole. Sorry. It’s just that the situation is important.
2
it didn't burn, they kept it
12
Any wallet is, essentially, a GUI for (an) address(es). The Ethereum network exists in large part to run smart contracts, many of which we call "tokens". The most common Eth token standard is ERC-20. stETH is an ERC-20 token. In other words, it runs on the Ethereum network and can be held at any Ethereum address--and therefore interacted with via any Ethereum-compatible wallet software...This is the token contract for stETH: [https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)..stETH **should** be sent to an Eth address, because it's an Eth token. However, there are bazillions of different Eth tokens, so most wallets don't display all possible tokens by default, even though the associated address can handle all of them. The token is there at the address, but the wallet doesn't display it by default. So you need to "add the token", which just means "tell your wallet software to pull the relevant info from the blockchain and display it". As soon as you do this, you can interact with the token in question just like any other ERC-20 token (e.g., USDT, USDC...)...So, technically all Binance has to do is load the token contract for stETH and send it back to OP. It's trivially easy, but they have to actually do it (and I think they will; it just might take them awhile to get around to it).

I don't use NFTs so I can't suggest what is a good website etc but I can answer the Ethereum questions...> 1: are there multiple Ethereum-compatible blockchain account or sites? in other words, is this just one wallet or different sources provide this?..There are lots of different Ethereum-compatible blockchains. These are things like Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Polygon. Which one of these you choose will decide where your NFT data lives. To use one, you will need some of the money native to that blockchain, and you'll need the money to be on that chain. On Ethereum and Optimism this is ETH. On Polygon it's called MATIC. ..For the purposes of issuing and selling NFTs I would say that all the main ones are secure enough. The main issue is that you have to pay fees when you mint or sell your NFTs, which can get high on Ethereum mainnet (although they're currently low). If you're minting NFTs you'll want them to be on a blockchain where people want to buy it, so the main consideration will be which one is most popular for NFTs. (Which I don't know, sorry.)..However, these all use the same wallet. A wallet is a piece of software that allows you to interact with the blockchain. A typical wallet would be something like MetaMask or Rabby. A wallet will store what we call your "seed", which is a piece of secret data, then use it to create some addresses. The same addresses will work on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
3
Use MetaMask for now. It’s the most widely used wallet and has terrible UI / UX. There are better wallets, but not integrated as widely
2
There are many wallet softwares, but not every site supports every wallet. Most sites support metamask. They all encrypt your seed phrase before storing it in your computer, so they are all secured unless your computer has virus.
2
You will be able to learn just about anything you’ll need to know on ethereum.org (wallets, accounts, NFT standards, best practices, and much more)
2
If you get into NFTs you'll never have much credibility in the mainstream art world.  Be prepared for that.

Please invest time learning about wallets.  Ethereum is amazing but complex, especially when getting started.  Take the time to learn, there are so many scammers in crypto.  Start small and expand as your get more confidence...Also, a hardware wallet is critical.  Use a Trezor or Ledger.  You can get the cheapest one, you don't need to spend a lot.  But always use a hardware wallet.  ..Finally, ingore anyone DMing you ever on crypto.  They are all scammers.  They prey on people who don't really understand the technology, and pretend to help you secure your assets. All discussions with anyone you don't know personally should be in an open forum, never in DMs.

Coinbase wallet is self custodial. If Coinbase went down all together and for some reason the wallet stopped working, you could import the seed into MetaMask or another wallet. If you are talking about funds on the exchange, if you couldn’t get them out in time, you’d be effed. In a panic, all my link got lost on FTX. I’d transferred out everything else and all my eth and missed keeping some for gas to get the link out.
5
Yes, if you have the seed phrase you can.
3
Unbank asap..Future of finance indeed
-1
fyi I confirmed with Coinbase support that any staked Eth in Coinbase Wallet would be lost if Coinbase went down and the wallet stopped working.  Once you stake it, it turns into a token specific to Coinbase Wallet.  No other wallet would be able to access it.
2
great ty...I guess I can test it out.  Wonder what would happen in Coinbase Wallet if I tried to unstake it using a different wallet.
1
I think you may be mixing up some different options. You can stake on Coinbase or hold cbeth. Coinbase also has a wallet in the exchange. But, they have a self custody standalone “Coinbase wallet” which is on chain and not staked with Coinbase if held on self custody wallet, you’d most likely have selected to use lido, rocket pool or possibly swapped into cbeth as an lst. It’s confusing because they have multiple wallets, so it depends on which you are using. They also now have a smart wallet.
2
Don't know about staking Coinbase Wallet, but if it's on-chain transactions should be possible in every wallet...Are these special Coinbase staking contracts or do you use some third party staking provider with your Coinbase Wallet?..For example. I stake on Kiln, but used Ledger Live for it. So if Ledger Live stops i don't have a problem, but if Kiln would stop i guess i would.
1
I dont see coinbase going bankrupt tho, id be really surprised.. main reason, they have no native token..they got nothing that fluctuates in price. So they have no need to transfer any funds to wallets and dump on their consumers
1
The smart wallet is really just the desktop version that compiles all your wallets together..nothing too special..rabby did it first

2
MetaMask did the same as well with MetaMask portfolio
1
Okay, sounds like BS however. If it's a on-chain token every wallet would be able to access it. However if the contracts to unstake stopped working, yes you would have a problem.
1
Honestly i dont use metamask too much..IK its the #1 wallet out there but imwhen i first started it was just too confusing..mainly because i didnt understand how my wallet was browing the internet web3 lol now i fully understand the wallet and web3 but just never used it enough for it to stick
1
You can look at the staked token (cbwsEth) but support told me the contracts to access that token are proprietary
2
There’s better wallet ui than MetaMask out there. A lot of people seem to like rabby. I still use MetaMask but I barely use anything eth based and haven’t for a year or so.
2
Good reason to get out of it. Even when I don't see Coinbase going bankrupt soon. 
1
good to know, i only play with BASED ETH, call me cheap..but i dont believe in paying for gas that costs more then the "gas" that goes into my car
0
If I do anything in eth these days, it’s base or arbitrum. Ironically, gas on L1 is cheap these days.

I’d get a Dappnode machine or build your own and install Dappnode OS. ..I’d then solo stake everything...If you want the quick and easy way, just swap it for rETH and call it a day by storing it on a ledger or similar hardware wallet.
130
Join the ethstaker community, you'll get a better response there...If you're looking to stake, as some of suggested, look at DappNode...For the actual process, get an offline machine, preferably running Linux and use it to generate the validator keystores, etc. Also you can use the offline machine to generate the offline wallet using something like MyEthereumWallet and sign all transactions offline, transfer the signed transaction to an online machine and broadcast it there. Never expose the private keys for anything on an online machine. Use strong passwords, write everything down on paper as a backup and keep it safe...You can look at coincashew's guide for more info, though that is staking directly using Linux instead of DappNode. You can also look at eth-docker...Hope this helps...If you're not comfortable with anything I wrote above, honestly I would not trust yourself to store $1M for staking. You should have some experience with cyber security hygiene and offline key management - preferably with Linux.
19
Of course it's safe if done safely...There is plenty of people staking 1M+...>Would you stake different coins and through different means?..What? No. You stake ETH...>Is there a coin that is safer to stake than others..Yes, ETH...>So you just pick the ones with the highest APY..What... No, you stake ETH.
38
All on Intel. Make Nana proud!
12
>> Is there a coin that is safer to take than others..Sweet summer child, if you have to ask that, then staking $1M is not safe for you...Don’t go chasing the highest APY.
6
Why would you do that
17
Solo staking ETH on your computer, zero third-party risk because the money never left your wallet (It is locked in a contract that guarantee to return it to your wallet). I staked 416k (5 validators) with my PC.
4
Just as safe as it is to stake $1
6
Uhhh I would not put $1M in staking I would put it in a T-Bill or GIC
49
I wouldn't stake that much money. I have seen enough in crypto to decide against it
3
Allnodes
10
I wouldn't post about staking a million dollars from anything but burner account.  You are just asking for all the scammers trying to contact you.
2
I used to have around $3,000 USD staked and they got stolen with a fake button on top of the staking site (Stakewise) I would never go anywhere any alt coin again...You could sign a fraudulent smart contact without knowing.
2
First off if you're asking this question then no it's probably not safe for YOU. Start with a smaller amount, get a ledger, get a crypto only pc...Do some research, visit https://defillama.com/yields to see returns that can be made. You can also farm as opposed to stake which has different levels of returns/risk involved. Look at TVLs/lockup periods...You are not prepared to stake/farm with 1m, but to answer your question, yes it is possible and safe to do so, the higher your risk tolerance the more you stand to make, but even with a safer strategy you can earn a more than "livable" annual return...Pendle is also a good resource to check, just don't go all-in as a newer user, there are no guardrails in defi, if you get scammed/rugged the money's gone and no one is there to call to refund it. Get familiar with how things work, understand which coins are safer with higher amounts and then deploy your funds accordingly.
2
If you must, invest in BTC and stay away from high apy alt coins that will drop 40% while you earn 20% lol. 😂 I’d invest most in an S & P index fund and perhaps 10% in BTC
2
Coin base has 5.60% just to hold USDC in your wallet before you even have to worry about staking. Solana is one of the highest staking I’ve seen at 6.80%. I only mess with Bitcoin, ETh, and Solona
2
Just use a liquid staking protocol like lido
4
Put all on red.
2
Depends on how big part of your wealth is that 1mil.
2
Robinhood is offering 5% apy on uninvested cash. With $5 month Gold membership
2
would stake ethereum. here’s a list of service providers...https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/..I use stakefish..current APR is around 4%..https://stake.fish/products/classic-staking..biggest risk from the validator is slashing so you want to use a trusted service...biggest risk from choosing the token to stake is token risk - i.e. it goes down and doesn’t recover. it’s important to choose something you have conviction in appreciation over time - like ethereum...unstaking exit queue is current 1hr + sweep delay of 9 days - so it would be ~10 days to access funds in your wallet from choosing to unstake. This changes over time though...https://www.validatorqueue.com/
1
I can't risk it all.
1
On the beaconchain...Are the ppl recommending rETH or stETH okay? OP said a million fucking dollars, not 25k
1
I would sell it, buy a house, and call it a day.
1
I would split it between a few different protocols and practice, practice, practice first with smaller amounts. Hardware wallet, disaster-proof scenario recovery, airgapped cold wallets. ..  .One of the bullets you can just buy rocket ETH ..I would suggest to split a decent amount of it on the eth restaking protocols, slightly higher risk, but if that stuff goes bust then it will completely devastate the ETH ecosystem anyways, and you are missing out on a lot of value there. Some portion needs to be in that imo (I would do half personally, but its high-risk, but ETH is my high-risk coin so would go for maximizing EV)..Consider studying up and running your own full node and hardware and run Linux
1
It is generally quite safe but there are still risks. It is best to spread it out in a few different places to be safe.
1
Solo staking is safest because you're not exposed to smart contract risk as with 3rd party liquid staking, but it also has highest technical-ability requirement.  For ETH staking, that's like 3% APY right now or if you want to increase your risk a little bit you can add mevboost to your validator for optimal block proposals which will bring you to about 4%. ..You could also consider USDC staking with Coinbase, which is 5.5% APY last I checked.  You are protected from market fluctuations in cryptocurrency because it is a stablcoin, but you lose everything if USDC loses its peg (which I don't think will happen, but DYOR).
1
No
1
Run 10 Pos validators.
1
The volatility is way higher than any APY you can get. So the main question is: what crypto do you believe in and want to invest in ? Then if it is stakable, you stake it as a bonus.
1
I dont like to recommend you something, because its always better if you do your own research. Anyway this is something I have good experiences with:..- ethereum offers 3,x% on ETH. you can use a service in case you dont want to upspin your own node, but consider that this behaviour leads to centralization. The biggest service holds currently 28% of all staked ETH..- makerdao offers 7% on DAI (stable coin)..- yearn offers a wide range of vaults with strategies for a lot of different tokens
1
It's safe IMO. If I'm to do it, I will stake it in DripFi's AUKI launch pool for good rewards.
1
Stake on cdc defi
1
[effacé]
1
It depends on where, but certainly if that's all you have, don't invest everything, take half and enjoy life.
1
I’d just send it to me and I’ll double it for you!
1
If i were to do it then i will opt to focus on safety and also focus on a platform where i can stake multiple assets as well this is one of the reason why i am a big fan of Parasail network.
1
Forget the highest APY, you need the most secure spot. That’s Coinbase for me.
1
If you have 100 million and want to diversify then sure.  If this is your entire life savings/retirement and everything you have.. there are far safer ways to live off the interest of a million.
1
Terrible idea
1
Not worth it unless you’re holding anyway. Staking is basically just a bonus at this point. You’d get far better apy in tradfi
1
[supprimé]
1
I would stake on my own node.
1
Not safe.
1
Step 1 trade all eth to Sol.
1
Give me half and I'll send you the rest
1
If you have $1,000,000,000 then yes it is safe. If you have $1,000,000 no it is not safe.
1
Definitely recommend! Smart contacts are always safe, and there are no admin keys to them either. 😅
1
It’s as safe as staking $1
1
No
1
Should stake $2,000,000 if you have. Trust me!
1
Chorus One is a great staking provider
1
Hi, I am a the youngest in a long line of princes from Nigeria. I can turn your paper dollar into real gold bars! No one in my community values gold as much as you do so we can make great deal! Send me 500k first and I'll ship you 400 Troy oz of pure African gold bar. Just send the other 500k after and I'll send 100 more oz gold and 100 oz silva. Consider this opportunity to both invest in gold and save a Nigerian tribe
1
It's never safe to stake. I staked 200k in a coin to earn 10%, by the time my stake period was over the investment was worth 100k. Mind you I started off with 20k investment. I still had a nice hit, but if I had just left the coins in my wallet and waited for it to go up, I would of netted WAY more. Don't be a sucker.
1
I wouldn’t stake 1,000,000 on a coin that has an endless supply! There is no limit as to how many Ethereum coins that can be generated! It’s as bad as keeping it in USD lol
1
I would totally stake HEX....  with that money....  5 Years easy
1
For those recommending Dappnode, it says that Intel is required which i find...odd. I prefer buildling machines running AMD. Will Dappnode not work with AMD builds and if not does anyone know an alternative that will?
1
Hell no! This is crypto for godsake
1
I use kiln through ledger
1
If your goal is consistent yield, maybe farm stablecoins. Do learn what the risks are, as different yield sources have different risks
1
No......You have a million dollars in crypto keep it locked up in your hardware wallet!..Go find another way to make 8%...Some people never learn.... Celsius.
1
I'd just convert it all to bitcoin.
-1
I wouldn't stake that much, if I really wanted to make a positive bet on the future of eth for whatever reason, I'd do grid bots, because they're more stable (half usdc), generally have a higher apy, and are entirely liquid with 0 lockup.
-3
Don't do it! There is about to be a crypto rally more than likely and if that's locked up while that happens you don't get any of the difference with the price going out you only get your percentage on your locked amount
-1
Buy a house and rent it.  Easy staking.
0
a million on ethereum no way
0
You be better off investing that money into NASDAQ. You would get a minimum of 10% return a year, more if it performs better...If we assume a 10% annual return, your investment could generate approximately $100,000 per year. Dividing this by 12 months, you might expect around $8,333 per month
0
Nothing is “safe” on the blockchain. It’s unregulated, and there’s nothing anyone can do “if” something were to happen. I look at crypto like a safe haven for scammers more than an investment place. I’d never trade a million dollars physical cash for something imaginary that I can’t touch or see or have insurance on. I think the bank is safe, because at least your money is insured. All you need is one wrong move, one bad money management mistake and your million could be gone to the blockchain. Cash is king not crypto
-1
:rolleyes:
-1
Take your money to the bank and take advantage of high interest rates.
-2
I would put it in blast
-15
I'm sorry but I really don't understand what's with Dappnode. It's basically buying a really overpriced Intel NUC with a pre-installed open-source OS. They almost do 100% margin on this, at least for Europe's prices. That's crazy for reselling hardware...The second option (building your own) is far better, even for non-tech people imho (and could be a fun way to get more technical if you want to stake yourself). For the price of a Dappnode Home, you could configure something 2 times more performant that could run dozens of applications 🫡
40
Not a good idea to deposit all of one's ETH in a single staking contract.  It would be far better to spread it across 4 to 5 LSTs (Rocket, Lido, Swell, etc.) and or LRTs (EtherFi, KelpDAO, Puffer).  That way, there is no single point of failure.
4
Hey, thanks for the info, I wasn't aware of Dappnode. Is it better than Stereum? https://stereum.net/..I've setup a test node with Sternum and had issues after a while which discouraged me from setting it up on main net. I'd Dappnode is more stable, I'm interested...Edit: the issue I had was a DB corruption which completely stopped the syncing and validation. This then required to re-sync from scratch which takes quite some time. I tried syncing from latest checkpoint but it wasn't doing anything. Another worrying piece was that during syncing, the i7 11th Gen NUC (32 GB fast RAM, 4tb fastest NVMe) was frozen (unusable), CPU at 100% for days whth very limited functionality, couldn't even check the progress... So yeah, this turned me down from setting that up in the end.
2
why are you saying Linux is the way?
1
This guy ETH!
12
I don't know if I would.  That's why I'm asking about it.  But if I would it would be to generate significant annual revenue.  There are probably better options but again just curious
14
Because they think the crypto market will rally for the next year. ..They are spending g time worrying about staking rewards when that 4% won’t even matter in 1 year. ..OP will make or lose so much value based on the price. ..OP, if you want to have more money than from staking, use a 5-10% loan to buy 5-10% more ETH. ..If the price of ETH doubles in 1 year. The extra 10% will double. You can later close the leverage and have more total ETH. ..10% extra carries a ridiculously low risk of liquidation. The price of ETH would have to literally die to liquidate.
1
That's safe, sure but the rates are horrendous.  You can do better in a high yield savings account and not lose points if you withdraw early.
24
If you do that, you won't benefit from ETH's price appreciation. Your suggestion is secure if you only consider staking rewards, but OP might be interested in keeping the underlying ETH for the long term. In that case I'd go for solo staking with dappnode...Edit: if you don't want to run a node on your own, have a look at SSV.
2
I'm guessing he doesn't want to sell his ETH
2
no thanks, not even enough to survive off of and probably won't keep up with inflation...  .To be honest, I am going to be completely surprised if the $USD is not in an almost unrecognizable form within 10 years (CBDC, perhaps nearing breaking-point of the debt situation, all perfectly timed for 2030)
1
My god we are talking about t bills in a cryptocurrency forums . My man you are in the wrong place . Bitcoin has very little to do with earning 5% and much more to do with opting out of the bs fiat monetary system .
-11
If Lido gets exploited, ETH as we know it, is fucked for a long time anyway. ..I’ve been 99% stETH for two years and it has funded irl expenses without having to sell my base asset..Live ya life
2
Yeah I've got a good amount in an index and it's been doing pretty well
1
Yeah Ive been taking advantage of the usdc on coinbase
2
Or Rocketpool
10
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ?!?!?!..All on black is the answer buddy.
1
Best answer tbh
1
But what's the difference between 25k and 1000k with these protocols? Isn't the process still just the same and the risk too?
1
Damn that's a great return.  More than 10% per month.  Kind of ridiculous actually and hard to believe.  No idea what a genesis member is or means but nice. ..I'm going to look into it thanks
1
During the next bull run maybe right now he’s gonna lose a good amount of it to market manipulation on BTC
2
Do you think you should believe 100% in a positive future for a coin to stake it?..You should definitely believe in a positive future of a coin to run a bot with that much money...I'm starting to play with bots some.  I think futures bots are more interesting atm..And what do you mean by "they're more stable (half usdc)"?
2

You can unstake all your ETH in a day, its not locked necessarily.

Buying their hardware is a way to support the project. That's why it's "over priced". I'm glad they have other ways to fund the project but just because something is open source, doesn't mean the development costs are free. If you can afford to support any open source project then you should try to donate to it in some way, especially if you are getting utility out of it.
13
If you're going to put a million on it for an investment, the most expensive Dappnode is 0.2% of the cost. Basically a rounding error to have zero effort. 
44
Dappnode didn’t cost me a dime. Built myself a NUC with a barebones i7 and did an unattended install of the Dappnode OS from Github with a bootable USB.
10
I agree but some people don’t mind burning the money for ease. Better to build your own 10/10 imo
9
what do you make of their OS?
2
Is there any guide on the internet you would recommend ? I'd like to try
1
just buy the NUC by urself and instlal the OS then
0
Because ETH is the only correct answer.

Happy cake day 🍰
2
If you did it could* generate significant annual revenue. The price of ETH could also tank you and you could lose everything.
17
Or you could just lose everything. If you're wanting to engage in risky behavior, make a business deal with Trump.
-1
If the crypto market rallies for the next year..That’s a reason NOT to stake..If you stake you’re committed to that one project, having the flexibility to diversify across several upcoming projects is the best way to maximize your investments
1
SGOV is over 5%, exempt from state tax and an liquid ETF. Better than HYSA.
5
S&P 500 is definitely safer than a cryptocurrency. 500 large US companies. Investing costs are also low if you invest in an low-cost S&P 500 index fund or S&P 500 ETF.
43
t-bills are safer and pay higher rates than high yields. 28 days are paying 5.3%.
17
Current 4-week T-bills are 5.25% and you aren’t subject to state tax at the end of the year just federal. A ladder style of buying $250k a week for four weeks you’ll get around $1k a week if my math is right…
2
$1M at 8% return average yield is more money per annum than 95% of the planet. You’d be a multi millionaire in most other countries with that income.
1
> Bitcoin has very little to do with earning 5% and much more to do with opting out of the bs fiat monetary system ...This isn't a Bitcoin sub
4
If Lido gets exploited ETH will be fine, and Ethereum will be stronger.
5
How much eth do you stake, sorry just curious....
1
If I had 1M and wanted to stake, nowhere in hell I would put double smart contract risk...I'd go and manually set up beaconchain nodes. For that amount of money you want the less risk possible.
1
Yes, especially considering how low apr is for staking compared to the volatility. ..Eth can swing 20-40% in a day, earning less than that in a year is highly regarded unless you're certain it's going up. ..A grid bot will swing in value less than staked coin, because a grid bot is 1/2 stablecoin in most cases, such as usdc. ..So if eth randomly drops from $3200 to $2500, if you single staked you lose about 20%, but if you used a grid you lost less than 10% and are earning extra interest on the volatility.
1
Still takes hours or days, while the crypto market usually crashed with hours. Might be too late to sell.
1
I thought it takes weeks in most cases.  Is it just ethereum that you can unstake quickly?
1
best returns
-1
aren’t there are fee as well when staking with them?
2
Well I agree, but 100% margin to just install an OS (10 seconds) and resell the NUC is really too much to claim that it’s to “support” it.
-5
Imagine trying to figure out staking with $1,000,000 at risk. ..You research for days worth of Time, to avoid the Dappnode cost. ..After many tests, you are ready to stake the $1,000,000..You do it, successfully, it’s staked. ..In 6 months you check and find out 5 months ago something happened. Someone has stolen the ETH, you have no idea how.
14
This is the way
5
True, but hey, "Idle hands are the devil’s workshop"
3
Love it
1
They have tutorials on YouTube
3
How would they "lose everything" if the price of ETH tanked? It would be worth less, sure, but no different than just keeping the same ETH in a wallet. Or do you mean something else?
23
They'd still be pulling in the same amount of eth, and if they could sit on it they could stand to gain more...But. The question was for generating annual income, and for that it'd suck to find out your month income in USD dropped by 20%
1
Yea, lock up staking is terrible. It does actually keep you from selling. The moment you would actually sell, when you can’t, you sometimes end up just holding and forgetting.
1
official figures will say I'm wrong, but real inflationis worse than 5% recently and unlikely to improve
-3
Nobody is here for trad-fi investing advice.
-25
S&P 500 basically just keeps up with inflation / true living expenses throughout time with its 7% or so, crypto will beat it.
-15
Are you kidding or are you serious?
-7
5.3% annualized, to be clear. You won't have 5.3% more money in 28 days.
12
Gotcha so it is just annualized.  Guess it's not a bad idea if something to do with money that's just sitting around.  Probably a better choice than staking something that has the same apy
0
Definitely not. Just look at what happened when FTX went bankrupt. Even though it was just a centralized exchange, the price of crypto assets like BTC went down. So the market is stupid and if Lido goes under, the market will likely also dump ETH (for a certain amount of time).
2
No, the software is free. ..The only fee is if you choose to use their staking pool, which is optional.
5
They're not just installing the OS. They developed the entire thing in the first place. Also, they maintain and update it. ..I'm not saying you should buy their hardware or else you're a bad person. I'm saying if you can afford to buy their hardware, you should consider purchasing it to keep the project going.
6
😆
1
> Someone has stolen the ETH, you have no idea how...Almost definitely because somebody compromised the keys of your withdrawal address. Protecting these is the same problem as protecting normal unstaked ETH.
1
i hope you would, you recommended it...
1
Compared to storing it on a bank account
-19
What the other guy probably meant was that eth could just roll belly up. Then you’d have just bragging rights and a number and no value from those 1 million dollars that can pay bank credit and lunch...Yet some of the people here pretend ut’s okay uf eth pruce tanks because you still have the same amount of eth. Good luck explaining that to the repo man. ..Npbody even asked if the million the OP was asking to invest is his savings, disposable income or is his whole life’s worth and he wants to luve off of it. If it’s the latter it damn well matters if eth tanks into oblivion, it even matter if it tanks significantly for a period of time in that case since staking rewards won’t cover the expenses.
1
Are they not trying to use 1 million dollars as an investment?
2
Correct, you’ll have face value of the bond in 28 days since they’re sold at discount (eg the interest that will have accrued by end of term). But it will be a 5.3% growth rate, eg (.053/365)*28.
1
That's what I was thinking. 5% in a month would be incredible.  Too good to be true

Yeah so basically .4% is what you’ll be cashing in at the end of 4-week cycle. I don’t have much to say about staking because I just keep all my crypto in a cold wallet. And I have a bunch of my ‘emergency’ funds in 4-week t-bills just to make a couple extra bucks. DIVERSIFIEDDDDD. If I die, my wife will not know where any of our money is tucked away 😂

I get the thing, I just think that one HUNDRED percent margin for a hardware product with little value added (compared to the original product) is really too much. Apple or even IBM make 40-60% margin, and they do everything starting from scratch..You really can’t justify to x2 the price of a hardware (you just installed an OS and put a sticker on it) because you’re developing an OS.

Where you loose 7% to 14% to inflation.

Hmmm
1
So with $1m in there, you’ll get $4k a month.  Or do $250k every week for four weeks and you’ll get $1k a week. No state tax either.
3
I was thinking the same as the person above.  That's be too good to be true.  ..So I'm confused, how much are you saying it would generate in interest after a month?
1
That sucks for her well let's hope you don't die lol
1
You missing the point bro
5
What the fuck happened to /r/ethereum hahaha
19
Which is better than potentially losing -80% in some extreme crypto cases. Staking isn’t risk free
-4
Yep, just about $4,065.75/mo if you buy a bond with a face value of $1M. A little bit more if you buy the bond so the discounted cost is $1M (e.g. bond value is $1,004,082.35, but discount cost is $1,000,000. In 28 days you receive $4,082.35.)
1
Bonds are different then other products, but if you take op's $1M example. You'd buy a $1M 28 day note, which would cost $995,934.25. IN 28 days you'd get a $1M back. So roughly $4,065.75 in interest over 28 days, or $53,000 over a year ( e.g 5.3%)...What strikes me is how confused folks are on this. When talking about interest rates, they're always inferred to be annual, unless otherwise noted. When someone says the FED funds rate is 5%, everyone understands that is annualized. When someone says their mortgage is 3.5%, no one asks if that is annualized, etc. So it's interesting that only here, that is being questioned, and is confusing...edit: link to the most recent auction (last week on 8/8/): https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2024/R_20240808_1.pdf
2
We get a lot of anti crypto people here for some reason
6
lol.   Add 14 percent a year up for 6 years.  Tell me how much you’ve lost.  With no possibility of any gains. ..At least with ether you can gain and if you follow market trends you will gain.
2
Meanwhile your deposit will depreciate at the rate of inflation, which is not the rate that is publicized, but is closer to the money supply growth rate...Additionally, the 5% on bills will not last forever...I'm not advocating ETH staking, but thinking bonds are increasing your wealth is not correct.

pretty pathetic

Mhm. It baffles me why they spend so much time here.

thorchain

This is precisely what Thorchain was built for.
6
You need to buy wrapped Bitcoin if you want to easily swap between the 2. Wbtc is legit and not a scam, Coinbase supports it.
10
Thorchain.  Or wrap your BTC into tBTC, then sell for ETH.
7
BTC is intentionally handicapped. It can't really do anything including facilitate a decentralized bridge... It's 2024 but Bitcoin is still living in 2009. People's entire plan for the future is to rely on centralization to facilitate any sort of scaling or features, eg the endgame of lighting is custodial/permissioned channels to reduce user fees, but I digress...Starknet is working something up with zero knowledge proofs that would allow an L2 to persist on ETH and BTC simultaneously. Couldn't guess if it's months or years away though. They were the team who tried creating Bitcoin's first/only L2 but ended up doing it on Ethereum instead due to Bitcoin's super constrained language and throughput. There's been some breakthroughs with Starks since they launched on Ethereum that may work with BTC code, at least in theory. But even then, the BTC fees may be prohibitively expensive without further optimization/breakthroughs unfortunately - at least that was the case last time I did a deep dive into their research maybe a year ago...Atomic swaps work well today for exchanging BTC to ETH or other coins. These are decentralized marketplaces, essentially. A couple wallets have it integrated in their swap feature. Exchange rates can be a bit off, nothing insane, but thus is the cost of P2P...There are other decentralized marketplaces that facilitate crypto swaps such as Bisq. YMMV with fees but may be worth digging through kycnot.me to try and find something suitable for your needs...If you just want exposure to BTC for price stability but want fast access to DeFi, wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) may be a good fit for you. Exchange rates are nearly exactly 1:1. It's not maximally decentralized (compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum), iirc the bridge is controlled by a DAO so it's not something I'd 'hodl' for years in place of BTC. But this enables the use of DeFi or loans on Ethereum using BTC in effect with relatively small fees, and can be swapped from any Ethereum DEX.
2
Thorchain for real BTC. Or swap via. any dex into wBTC (wrapped bitcoin, custodial). Or for more slightly centralized option which is faster, use Changenow. Those are a few options off the top of my head but I'm sure there's many more.
1
Via Monero at trocador.app. It’s not a true decentralised, but truly fast way. Trocador is an aggregator of small centralised exchanges with ratings and current swap time estimations.

Nobody out of a cex stands to profit from exchanging btc for eth except a bridge which would essentially be a cex without fiat or kyc

Find a way to convert BTC to WBTC and you can use DeFi with WBTC. There is always some sort of centralization when you deal with cross-chain, except for L2 to L1. BTC to WBTC is centralized, they can one day stop allowing BTC to WBTC conversion, and they will depeg.
1
1. Get to WBTC first. .2. Bridge to Arbitrum and provide single-sided liquidity on TraderJoe using the WBTC-ETH pool using a single bin..3. Watch as your WBTC converts into ETH without incurring a single penny of swap fee (in fact you will gain trade fees instead)..4. Remove liquidity once entire position converts to ETH.
1
I'm mostly working with wbtc
1
You’d probably be better off keeping your btc and just buying some eth instead of worrying about wrapping btc. There’s some drama right now around wbtc. If you want to start playing with defi, buy some eth and try sending it to an L2 like base or arbitrum to get a feel for it all and testing small amounts while learning. Solana is also good for this with cheap fees to dip your toes in defi.

I suggest to take a deep check on Zyptoapp. Fast, cheap and most important secure way to manage your crypto assets. No need to do it on CEX any more.

UEX.finance

Swaps will intrinsically take time because of the time to finality (TTF) across not one but two different chains.  If you are using a more modern faster network such as a DAG this time can be greatly decreased. I prefer atomic swaps when possible as they are cheap and secure.  However, for your example of decentralized BTC/ETH trades, you can use a DEX or p2p exchange for instant trades.    .  .Ultimately you still have TTF when you are receiving assets, it's just how the blockchain works.  There is good and bad in everything and even CEXs have some benefits.  CEXs are just shuffling money on their own books 99% of the time so you aren't actually using crypto nor interacting with blockchains when you use a CEX so you can benefit from the speed of a centralized system.  Although your money won't be moving very fast or at all if a CEX desires to flag your account or if the CEX goes under.  Personally, I'll take decentralized any day of the week.    .  .Faster networks are required for widespread (real) crypto adoption. It would take over 180 years to onboard every human on the planet as BTC stands today, and even that is only possible if you subtract all the present traffic on the network.  Ethereum isn't much better in this regard.
0
Agreed. Not the cheapest, not the fastest, but if you want native asset swaps for <$5 in fees right now I'm not sure where else you are to look
7
How does it work on Thor chain
1
Be careful, their fee could be as high as several hundred dollars, totally insane, used once, never looked back
1
How do you swap BTC for Eth using thorchain ? I mean BTC lives in his Blockchain and Eth lives in Ethereum
2
WBTC, like any kind of bridging involving BTC, relies on trusted third-parties, which is bad for the OP for the same reason they don't want to use a centralized exchange.
3
No, you don't.   Bridging and wrapping tokens is so you can hold assets on non-native chains for DeFi.  You can trade coins as OP has asked without using a CEX via a DEX, swap, P2P exchanges, and atomic swaps.
5
Do you know anything about Bitcoin bridges. Like swapping 1 BTC for 1 WBTC.
1
tBTC is one way of doing it permissionlessly and rather cheaply. 0% mint fee and 0.2% redemption fee which is accessible to retail and not gated to institutions like WBTC is.
3
TL;DR: TTF is a limiting factor on any blockchain which is why faster and faster networks are being built.  You are going to run into this speed concern anywhere you look, from simple transactions to signing smart contracts for DeFi or otherwise. See: blockchain trilemma.
2
Learn how Thorchain works first to make sure you want to use it, then use Thorswap to do it...And remember - cheapest and fastest will always be CEX. You’re going to pay extra for a decentralized swap.
1
Try it on edge.app. Thorchain is integrated directly

I'd rather use WBTC than trust a bridge. Easiest hack targets in defi. Bridges are a black box.

No, he clearly doesn't know anything.
2
Defi bridges are useful but they are not the optimal solution, do not trust them implicitly. Coinbase the CEX is the same thing as a bridge, just use a CEX.
0
So OP can mint tBTC and sell for ETH.  I would check swap prices for tBTC <> ETH on CowSwap to confirm slippage is low.
1
What do you think WBTC is exactly? You’re contradicting yourself here.
10
You are so ignorant you don't even know what you are saying nor how wrong you are or the fact that you're directly contradicting yourself.  To wrap a token which mints WBTC for example, you ARE USING A BRIDGE.  You know those scary interchain things that have been hacked before and that you won't seem to shut up about.  So you are contradicting yourself because you're scared of bridges and say don't use them but then you want to wrap tokens which are done EXCLUSIVELY by bridges, it's kind of their thing. ..You don't need to wrap a token to trade between tokens.  This is what the aforementioned DEXs, swaps, P2P exchanges, and atomic swaps are for.
6
Thank you.  Don't waste your time on u/HentaiAtWork420 he thinks babies come from bridges.
5
A defi bridge like Portal is not the same thing as a bridged asset like wbtc and btc. Bridge has multiple meanings just like lots of words.
-3
Sell your Bitcoin for cash. Buy WBTC with cash. No bridge involved. Wtf are you on about? Clueless.
-9
Yes, you're clueless. Where do you think the value of wbtc comes from?
8
It's okay sweetheart, you can be wrong.  If you'd admit it rather than doing verbal and mental gymnastics to avoid reality you may actually learn something sometime.
4
We're not talking about the white paper on WBTC. The thread is about exchanging BTC for ETH. If the OP wants to do that, they can use WBTC.
-3
You have no idea what you're talking about and just being annoying bro. My original comment was correct and you just had to insert yourself into the thread with some pointless comment.
-2
Where do you think wrapped tokens come from?  Do you know where babies come from?  Bridges are smart contracts that lock up the native asset and mint-wrapped tokens in exchange.  You go back through the bridge (executing the smart contract again, you know the one they call a bridge) to get your asset back on the native chain.  .Wrapped tokens like WBTC wouldn't exist without bridges nor would they have any value anyway without them because there would be nowhere to exchange them for the underlying asset, other than going through roundabout methods to sell to 3rd parties like you are suggesting, or 4th parties in your suggestion.
4
Do some research (on the subject not hentai) and you'll realize how wrong you are.  Let's finish this ridiculous plan up here first...:  .So first you are going to swap your BTC for cash, so you can then go and buy WBTC, and then... profit?  The only people profiting there are the greedy CEXs.  .  .Please complete this foolish plan for us.     .  .Bending over backward to defend your wrong answer you now have failed to answer the original question altogether. OP asked how not to rely on CEXs, where are you going to get wrapped anything if not from either a bridge (the smart contracts where they are created and destroyed), a CEX, or any of the solutions I've stated twice now, any of which are the correct answer to OPs question.
3
I'll just repeat my same comment since you can't read. Bridge has multiple meanings. You're incorrect insaying that a bridge like Portal is the same thing as WBTC.
0
I'm not reading that wall of text. The question is - how do you easily swap btc and eth? Use wbtc. That's the answer. Have fun arguing over semantics on reddit, clown.
0
You're still talking out your rectum to prove your nonsense.  Now you're trying to dabble in semantics.  A bridge in crypto connects different blockchains (The future is multichain).  The smart contracts that comprise the bridge may be coded differently from bridge to bridge but that is the ONLY meaning of bridge in crypto.  There are three or four different ways the underlying asset is locked up but the principal is the same...So now you know where wrapped tokens come from, did anyone teach you where babies come from?  Lord knows we don't need your ignorance reproducing.
5
I can't prove a negative so go ahead and share some info about all these different bridges you're so knowledgeable of...In the mean time feel free to read up on them:  .Wrapped Tokens: Bridging the Blockchain Space  .[https://komodoplatform.com/en/academy/wrapped-tokens/](https://komodoplatform.com/en/academy/wrapped-tokens/)..Wrapped Tokens: Why They're Risky, But Why We Need Them..[https://www.liquidloans.io/vault/research/blockchain/wrapped-tokens](https://www.liquidloans.io/vault/research/blockchain/wrapped-tokens)

Wrong answer, again.  That's your problem you spend your time trying to double down on your ignorance all while refusing to read or learn.
2
Bro is so mad lol
-1
I'm not mad, although I do have a problem with ignorance as it is at the root of all the world's problems.  Resolve ignorance and the world would be a utopia...Again bridges are what create wrapped tokens.  They wouldn't exist without those scary bridges.  Also, a wrapped token isn't needed to swap two assets.  You'd just swap directly on a CEX, DEX, swap, atomic, swap, p2p exchange, etc. etc...

Renouncing ownership doesn’t mean releasing the private key, usually it means giving up an on-chain permission by burning the ability for an account to make further privileged transactions (e.g. by transferring ownership of a set of contracts to the zero address).

In case your device is compromised/gets compromised, you'd not want to have your seed phrases on it, so a hardware wallet is ideal for creating seed phrases and for using defi.
2
>I am new to the crypto world..Just a forewarning. This phrase often lures in bots and scammers who prey on newbies. Practice paranoia and don't blindly trust any one, typically, since crypto transactions are non-reversable. Especially if they've contacted you outside of public channels away from scrutiny, or want you to download anything or connect your wallet somewhere you don't trust and understand absolutely. Always compare information gathered from one person or source against multiple other sources, aka DYOR...>First of all, does it matter which app someone is going to use to create his DeFi wallet? Does it make any difference (in security or any other) if I create my defi wallet via metamask or coinbase or exodus or some other app?..These are all different hot wallets. Your private key will be stored in a file on your device in all of these cases. If you have malware or an insecure PC this file will inevitably make its way online into someone else's hands...Maintaining good operational security (opsec) is the most important thing over choosing a wallet. That means don't store your seed phrase or keys in a cloud-based password manager or email server or notepad file, don't download suspicious torrents, don't run random exe files, don't open pdf's from untrusted sources, have an anti-virus (Windows Defender is fine). Mostly, practice common sense...Generally it doesn't matter which wallet you use, any hot wallet should be fine, but it can sometimes matter. There have been cases where users of certain wallets (see: Atomic Wallet) have mysteriously had their funds drained in private key exploits, presumably by a backdoor of sorts (potentially bad/known RNG) due to how widespread it was. Reputation is everything in crypto, the longer a wallet (or app or blockchain) has been widely used the probability for there are security flaws within it decreases...Personally I use whichever has the best UX for my needs. Rabby is really great for newbies with its scam/spam protection, it can simulate transactions to see if they will fail beforehand, it also automatically adds new L2 networks and tokens. MetaMask is an OG wallet with more advanced settings but hasn't updated its UX in years. I use Coinbase wallet mainly to interact with dApps or the Base-L2 on my phone, plus it has really great integration with their exchange for very fast deposits and withdraws...>Secondly, no matter where I created my defi wallet, I can import it to another defi app, for example I can create it via coinbase and then import it to metamask, is there any impact to the wallet when you import it on different apps? (Is this info stored somewhere? Does it make it easier to compromise?)..Your private key is what you use to access your public key address on the blockchain. You can import this key into any wallet to access the same address. Your funds are never stored inside a wallet, you should think of them more like a keyring (that's what they were almost named) and you're simply copying keys that each unlock the same door...There is a 'derivation path' standard on Ethereum for which your private key is derived from your 12-25 word seed phrase, but for dumb reasons not every wallet adheres to it. I don't think you can import some hardware wallet seed phrases into a hot wallet and generate the same key pair. I think every hot wallet uses the same path though, meaning a wallet created in Coinbase can be imported into Exodus or MetaMask or Rabby and vice versa and pull up the same accounts...Whenever you back up a wallet copy down both your private key and your seed phrase, for long term storage it's worth it to note which wallet was used and its software version too. Using the private key should always work but it's inconvenient and impractical. Using the seed will work 99% of the time. If for some reason the seed doesn't work and you didn't save the private key, you can search online which derivation path the software wallet used and with a wallet like MEW (the OG OG wallet with the most settings) generate the private key using your seed and the custom derivation path...It should be no easier to compromise your private key by having it on 1 wallet or 5 wallets on the same machine. If you start importing it onto different machines, the weakest link is what's holding everything up..."DeFi app's" are things like GMX or Uniswap. They're smart contracts, essentially scripts, that persist on the blockchain, that you use your wallet to interact with. Every hot wallet can interact with DeFi apps, there's not really such a thing as a DeFi wallet...>Bonus question about railgun: I have read multitple posts about it, is it used only to hide your coins or is it a method to increase security on your wallet too? Is it better to keep the coins shielded or it doesn't matter?..Hide your coins. Adding additional steps into your process necessarily decreases your security, it's the difference between trusting A and B won't fail or A and B and C... I have no experience with it to say if it's trusted or not. If I was going to send you money and didn't want you to see my wallet balances I'd use an app such as this, if I was just interacting with dApps on my own there's no need...Since you're new and just getting into crypto, and eager to learn, it's worth mentioning that most of these wallets will become obsolete in the next 1-5 years anyway. Account abstraction is on the horizon, using your phone or CPU's security enclave (the offline-chip it uses to securely manage your passwords, same as a hardware wallet) to generate your keys if not some form of email+password+MFA. This will enable you to create an account with a service or website and use those credentials instead for your wallet credentials....Examples of "AA"...https://wallet.coinbase.com/smart-wallet (click create to see) - .. https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/auto-payments-for-self-custodial-wallets.html

Which wallet mostly matters when it comes to using it, metamask is the most common and almost all dapps will connect to it. More obscure wallets might not be able to connect to many dapps. You can generally use the same seed phrase on multiple wallets, unless they use some non standard derivation or a different number of seed words. I have the same seed in metamask, Rabby and I think math and c98 wallets. Be careful using obscure wallets as that might expose your crypto on all wallets using that seed. For example, awhile back a Solana wallet provider called Slope was exposing their users seeds by sending lists of these seeds across the net unencrypted when there was no valid reason for them to even be keeping a copy. The users didn't know they were doing this until a copy was intercepted and thousands of wallets were drained, including mine. So choose your wallet provider carefully or better yet use a hardware wallet like a ledger. The nano X can be connected to metamask, Rabby, Phantom etc even on mobile and allow access to all the dapps without risking your private key and seed phrase to the wallet providers. I find the coinbase wallet to be slow, clunky and difficult to use compared to all the others I've tried and would avoid it.
1
I would reccomend looking at most secure and easy to use Defi wallet app called Zyptoapp. Before I used TW and Metamask but when I found Zyptoapp I transfered all assets into it. .Take a look, learn about it and then decide.
1
I am aware of that, I do not compare hardware wallet vs software wallet. I am just trying to figure out if it makes any difference to create a defi wallet on metamask vs create a defi wallet on coinbase or another app...Since you mentioned a hardware wallet though, is it better to send the crypto directly on a hardware wallet or send them through railgun?
1
thank you so much, currently I am using crypto.com defi wallet app (not sponsored!), the UI seemed the easier for me. I guess it is considered a popular and safe option...You helped a lot
1
so, if I use coinbase, metamask or X company to create a defi wallet, that X company has a copy of my seed phrases? .More specific, how do I know if the app I used to create my defi wallet doesn't store somewhere my seed phrases?
1
thanks but currently I am not looking to find  the best wallet. I am trying to figure out how DeFi wallets compare with each other
2
It depends on how exactly the app is doing it. For example, some Coinbase apps store the seed on the secure part of your device and you need a biometric to access it. More hacky apps store the seed in your browser data (lol)...In the future, it will all be standardized. But, right now, it's the wild west and we're experimenting...I would just trust the big names for substantial investments. Coinbase, metamask, etc.
2
thanks, one more thing, if I store the seed phrase on paper and delete the app does that make it safer regarding compromise?
1
If the app was already compromised, then the seed phrase the app created is also compromised even if you delete the app...If you're worried about security, I would keep all your important tokens on a hardware wallet. Second best option is to use a trusted centralized exchange like Coinbase/Kraken/etc. Third best option is to create your own wallet via Coinbase Wallet or Metamask but you have to be sure  that your own device is not already compromised.

Im using Zerion, gives me a good overview about my ETH holdings (Even Layers, Staking & Lending)
3
I recommend Talisman Wallet’s Asset Discovery tool. It will scan for every evm token listed on coingecko…. Which isn’t  every meme coin, but does include a lot of them.
2
Not every chain but superscan covers a bunch of common ones
2
You might want to check out tools like "Debank" or "Zerion". They offer multi-chain tracking and can help you see holdings across various Ethereum-based chains
2
I'm using CoinStats, pulls all my holdings across 20+ EVMs
2
Etherscan.io has a multi chain view with 26 chains included for the address in question
2
Jup. Enter your address in Debank and you'll find 99%,even if the funds are lent/staked on a site

I'm giving it a try

That's great, thank you. I've dabbled with it but on polkadot

How secure and private are the encrypted values? An issue with the TEE approach is the potential for a bug in hardware to reveal the data, what are the potential downsides here? Could this be trusted to store private data whose outcome is tied to a large amount of assets?
1
 Using Zama’s fhEVM with ERC-3643 could boost security and privacy
1
Main downside is the computation overhead. In terms of security, modern FHE schemes are usually expected to come with a formal security proof reducing a successful attack to solving some computationally hard problem. Under the assumption that the problem is truly hard (requires P≠NP) there is no probabilistic polynomial time adversary that can break your scheme.
1
FHE offers 128 bit of security, and uses the same security assumptions as post-quantum schemes standardized by NIST. You can read more about it here: https://www.zama.ai/post/fully-homomorphic-encryption-and-post-quantum-cryptography
1
Indeed computation overhead can be a downside for cloud applications, but blockchain applications have high latency anyways due to networking, so FHE works perfectly there
1
Are there any trust assumptions with the setup on how the encryption keys are managed? Any 51% esque attack vector?
1
Hmm, is there an understanding of the current cost to break these 128 bits of security? Wondering if something like a private key that controls assets could be securely stored.
1
It would be equivalent to breaking 128 bit AES, so pretty secure ;)
1
But is it tho? And considering future advances? 128 bits of security is many magnitudes less secure than 256 bits
1
It is according to the current best understanding of lattice cryptography, and is what is considered the gold standard of post-quantum cryptography. If you can break this, we are in deep trouble for the future 😅
1
Fair, making sure. Had ideas for projects using private exams that relied on TEE but felt like it wasn’t secure enough to have a lot of value tied to values being private, this seems like a better bet.
1
Yes FHE is definitely stronger security wise. You should try to build it with the fhEVM!
1
Know of any potential concerns I may have regarding consensus/validation?

Title: Key movements in Ethereum staking since the launch
24
Ethereum staking has definitely evolved since launch! The increased participation and upgrades like sharding are really shaping the future.
4
Is this good or bad
2
It’s interesting to see how Ethereum staking has evolved and how significant upgrades influence staking activity
2
The first spike align with upgrade, because that upgrade was enabling unstaking, aka derisk staking...The second spike didn't really align with upgrade, seems purely random.
1
The next big moment for eth staking is on tokemak.xyz
0
Sharding was replaced by rollups
1
very good
2
Yeah, absolutely true! and the big picture is better seen in the charts covering a long period
1
The second spike is just before the upgrade, multiplied by the effect of uncapping EigenLayer restaking
1
no, it's on the way, at the Proto-danksharding (blobs) station now
1
Dank sharding is rollup not sharding. Rollup is functionally equivalent to sharding, each L2 is basically a shard. L2 post on beacon chain just like shard was designed to. Anyway, there is no more sharding, only dank sharding which is rollup, unless they add sharding back again.

Railgun. Or if you want to lose some money but be super secure you can wash it through cake wallet via monero swaps
11
What you’re describing is pretty much tornado cash, but there’s likely not enough transactions to completely obfuscate your accounts AND using it will taint your addresses, since it’s banned in the US.
15
The ideal thing would be EIP-7503, but it hasn’t been implemented...Thread here: https://x.com/ethereumintern_/status/1816164288278450306
2
Railgun is probs the best right now..Aztec is the most promising, but still aways from mainnet..The Payy app also provides some privacy
2
I second railgun .
2
[https://railgun.ch/#/](https://railgun.ch/#/)..Vitalik himself uses it to hide his transactions: [https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/22/vitalik-buterin-transfers-300000-to-the-privacy-protocol-railgun-again/](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/22/vitalik-buterin-transfers-300000-to-the-privacy-protocol-railgun-again/)
3
Well you could use an instant exchange service, check out swapspace.co (aggregator to show the best rates). At best, this would obfuscate it, someone looking would see the transaction go into, say StealthExchange, but not necessarily see the output transaction...Although, with some sleuthing they might be able to make an educated guess where it ended up...The best would be to route through the Monero network, I think trocador has a specific service for this, for a small fee of course.
2
Check out lndry. It takes like 10 minutes to complete but it’s legit ..https://lndry.xyz/

I live in the US. I am not doing this for tax fraud purposes or anything. I still want to keep my money white and pay taxes on them when I eventually sell. I just want digital privacy since I believe it to be a human right...Would putting it through railgun taint my money?..Atomic swaps to Monero and back seems like the best option, but this can get super costly since I plan on anonymizing a few hundred thousand USD and the percentage based swap fees will be a lot of wasted money.
2
Why is there also this site? .https://www.railgun.org
3
They charge a 0.5% fee for shielding then unsheilding. I would like something that doesn't have any percent based fee since I am sending an extremely large amount.
1
Sadly your government doesn’t think the same way and view privacy as a crime. Using tornado cash is ilegal which is outrageous.
4
[railgun.xyz](http://railgun.xyz) is the site as well :)..One is for the organization, another for technology and one for the wallets. They are all linked together, see for yourself. And better check wikipedia, if you are in doubt.
1
You may try not the highly secure / expensive ways, but something kind of OK / inexpensive...E.g. stake your ether @ Lido, then after some time initiate unstaking, auto-receive NFT from Lido for the funds you are unstaking, sell / transfer this NFT to your another wallet...If somebody watching you does not know much about how ether staking works, it might fool them or you can claim funds being lost to a hack.

I can't access that site. .Also, I am very cautious of sites hosted in China handling my crypto... (railgun.ch)

You don't stake from a cold wallet. You need to transfer your eth to the deposit contract to activate your validators...There are many different ways to run a validator so it depends on your technical experience. You can use something like DappNode, you can use docker, you can use Linux and bash scripts, etc. r/ethstaker has a lot of resources...Best cold wallet is a bit subjective. You can get a hardware device which is what most people recommend, but you can use an offline machine and use something like MyEthereumWallet to sign transactions so they can be broadcast on an online machine...Hope this helps.
10
There are multiple options to liquid stake eth that is on your ledger, like stader, rocket etc. Fees can be high on the ethereum chain so you might want to use an l2 like arbitrum. I know kelp even offers liquid restaking on l2s.
2
> Can you self stake on a cold storage device?..Yes, you specify withdraw address when you sign the staking contract. Staked ETH and reward will only go to that address, it can be a cold wallet...> Where/How do you self stake? (recommendations)..Run a node, generate staking key, [sign the staking contract](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/). Can be done in any computer with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM. I made a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpB0h9_XWvQ) for windows...> Best cold wallets for ETH and SOL?..I just generate and store the seed phrase in an air gapped mini computer. Make sure anything plugged into it never touch a non air gapped computer again.

Title: Understanding Proving existence in Ethereum State

Technical question, technical answer:..To understand how to prove the existence of a piece of state \( X \) in Ethereum, it's important to grasp how Ethereum manages its state and uses Merkle trees to ensure data integrity and efficiency. Let's break down the components and processes involved...### Ethereum State..Ethereum maintains several data structures to track the state of the blockchain. The three main state trees are:..1. **World State Tree**: This tree represents the current state of all accounts, including both externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. Each node in the tree is a hash of a set of state objects, which contain account balances, contract code, and storage...2. **Transaction Tree**: This tree contains all the transactions included in a block. Each leaf node in the tree corresponds to a transaction, and the hash of the transactions form the tree's structure...3. **Receipt Tree**: This tree contains receipts for each transaction in a block. A receipt includes information like the gas used and logs generated by the transaction...### Proving Existence in Ethereum State..To prove that a piece of the state \( X \) exists, the following process is generally followed:..1. **Identify the Relevant Tree**: .   - If \( X \) relates to an account balance or contract storage, it is part of the **World State Tree**..   - If \( X \) is a specific transaction, it is in the **Transaction Tree**..   - If \( X \) is related to transaction outcomes (like logs), it is in the **Receipt Tree**...2. **Merkle Tree and Merkle Proofs**:.   - Ethereum uses Merkle Patricia Trees, a specialized form of Merkle Tree that enables efficient and secure verification of data..   - Each tree is represented by a root hash, which is stored in the block header. This root hash is a cryptographic summary of the entire tree's contents..   - To prove that a specific piece \( X \) exists within the state, you must provide a **Merkle Proof**. This proof consists of the path from the leaf node (representing \( X \)) to the root of the tree...3. **Creating a Merkle Proof**:.   - A Merkle Proof involves listing the nodes (hashes) on the path from the leaf node to the root, including all sibling nodes needed to recompute the hashes up to the root..   - By hashing the provided nodes in order, anyone can verify that the resulting hash matches the root hash stored in the block header, confirming \( X \)'s inclusion in the tree...4. **Verification**:.   - Given the Merkle Proof, anyone can independently verify the existence of \( X \) by recalculating the hashes along the path and checking against the known root hash..   - This process ensures data integrity and authenticity without needing to access the entire state...### Example..Let's say you want to prove the existence of an account's balance within the World State Tree. Here's how it might look:..- **Locate the Leaf**: Identify the leaf node in the Merkle Patricia Tree that corresponds to the account's state..- **Gather Nodes for Proof**: Collect all necessary nodes along the path from this leaf to the root..- **Generate the Proof**: Use these nodes to create the proof..- **Verify**: The recipient of the proof hashes these nodes, following the Merkle Tree structure, to ensure the calculated root hash matches the block's root hash...### Conclusion..In Ethereum, proving the existence of a piece of state involves using Merkle Patricia Trees and Merkle Proofs. The ability to verify data inclusion without accessing the entire state ensures both scalability and security, key aspects of Ethereum's design. By understanding these mechanisms, developers can efficiently interact with Ethereum's blockchain, ensuring data integrity and trust.

eth_getProof..Or witnesses: https://medium.com/@mandrigin/kv-witness-8985168537f9...Both give you enough info to compute the state root yourself, and verify independently from alternative nodes if needed
1
Note that all of that is invalidated and irrelevant when it comes to verifying the authenticity of anything off-chain.  Any data input to the blockchain is subject to "The Oracle Problem" meaning the data is only as legit as the "oracle" who inputs the data.  So blockchain can't really verify any authenticity.  All it can do is say, "Here's what the oracle told me."
-1
Thank you very much for such an insightful answer. Do they trees have different sizes (I assume so) and how can I calculate their depths?
2
I think eth get proof doesnt work anymore: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186)
1
Can you clarify what you mean? It seems that if you’re doing this for yourself, i.e. running your own node, you can query state and then on the basis of an event that someone is saying happened compute inclusion proofs and verify them.
1
[effacé]
1
In a decentralized network with no authority, majority rules.  So whoever controls more nodes on the network can push through their version of the data as long as it passes basic cryptographic checks...We've seen this in action with nodes picking which transactions to include in which blocks based on how profitable it is for them.  Normally you'd think whoever shows up first gets in the next block but it doesn't work that way.
-1
Again thank you. I have found that gpt is not that good at this sort of stuff so I turned to reddit lol.  .My main issue is understanding what is meant by prove X is in the state? And how would gas cost of a block affect these trees?

Ethereum is not a business.
24
The Ethereum roadmap is **Rollup Centric**.....Meaning Ethereum has been designed for the free market to extend its utility in every novel way, while their rollup can still maintain ETH's security and decentralization. Effectively to sidestep the slow and relatively small team of core developers...Bug Arbitrum or Optimism if you want a business mindset. Or Blast, or Mantle, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, Polygon, Loopring, on and on and on. The list grows every day...https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary..Solana's CEO (smh already) has said repeatedly new coin issuance is not a cost to the network. According to Anatoly if he mints 10T SOL and dumped it in secret, that's A-OK. And he lied about SOL's total supply by like 3x already, since due to their immense centralization no one was/is able to audit the chain, what not even a year ago? They're being investigated by the CFTC and SEC for this. Let's see how well your 'business roadmap' ages first maybe...Hint: a commodity (which any decentralized crypto asset truly is) doesn't and can't have a 'business roadmap'..The EF focusing on research is the best thing for Ethereum. Besides that, the roadmap in place will make Solana obsolete fairly soon. Look into danksharding, into the verge, into zero knowledge proofs, into based rollups, most of which the free market is developing on their own utilizing EF-funded research...The Eclipse L2 uses the Solana virtual machine but doesn't go offline since it settles to Ethereum, as just one example of what the EF can't and shouldn't be doing but we're getting anyway...Ethereum is too big and valuable to make drastic or risky changes even semi frequently. If ETH went offline just once then value would cease to settle on it and it'd be relegated forever to being a shitcoin casino, kind of like Solana... A developed and thoroughly tested non-contentious fork takes like 3 additional years just to reach consensus among validators, and there's nothing Lubin or anyone can say or do to speed that up either.
7
Ethereum Foundation is there to contribute to the opensource project and improve on it so it can remain open, agnostic and accessible. That's why they post and work on PhD level topics related to it...Businesses go out and develop their products on Ethereum because of that so they can focus on their products. If the EF was a business and prioritized that development, that would be a conflict of interest for any other business that wanted to develop on it as the EF would just crowd them out, exactly how Amazon screws over third party vendors.

Straight in with $60k of eth without even testing a smaller amount! ..Always send a small test first, the gas cost is worth the peace of mind you will get!

Great example of why centralization is what most people prefer.  Op got scammed, even knowing it was his responsibility to "be his own bank", anybody can make a mistake, but in the world of crypto, there are no-take-backsies.  This is what you get with "decentralization" - no accountability...That's fine if you're playing with toys, but if it's real money you can't afford to lose, nobody wants that liability...Normal people realized this 100+ years ago...So how long before crypto bros come to this realization?  We're still waiting...

I’m pretty new to this and regretting I didn’t try a small transaction first but thought it would be ok using their dapp to do the transfer.

This is what happened!!.I just went there now and connected my wallet and it is showing it is there!.I was on their app last night and tried to stake there and it looked like it never went through..This morning I connected my wallet to ether. Fi and it said I still had all my eth so I tried to stake it there. .I don’t understand how it went to ever stake when I had disconnected my wallet from their app.

Thank you so much. I have been feeling sick all day and am so glad to get this sorted out..Have u used everstake before? If u have I would love to ask a couple of questions

All of them!!! 24ETH.So glad I got it sorted out..Time for a vodka or 4 now
1
I’m an all or nothing kind of guy, but I will definitely do that next time I send any crypto anywhere!!
1
Not scammed. Just misplaced as I used two apps and didn’t realise my wallet was still going to accept the first contract I had interacted with after I thought it was cancelled
2
Looks like you used a scam app. What’s the url for the website you tried staking with?
3
If you sign a permission for a contract to access your wallet, you don't need to be connected to the website anymore. For good and worse...Maybe you signed a transaction but the gas set was too low, then later the market gas price dropped in that range and your original transaction finally got processed...Transactions all have a nonce number attached and they go up in order. 1 2 3 4 5. If you make a transaction, say nonce#10, and it hasn't gone through for whatever reason, even if you make transactions #11 #12 #13 so on with higher gas that should go through, they will all be held up until #10 goes through first. While they're held up your wallet would display your balance as if #10 hasn't gone through, because at that point it still hasn't. To unfreeze a transaction you'd look at your public address on Etherscan to find the nonce# of the pending transaction, then open advanced settings in your wallet and turn on 'custom nonce', and send a new transaction using the stuck tx's nonce#... Any transaction, even sending yourself 0ETH will overwrite that stuck one and free up the rest of your transactions, or you could resend the same transaction using higher gas, or in your case replace it with your new Etherfi transaction. (Protip: don't adjust the default gas quote if you don't know precisely what you're doing).

Sounds fun.  I hate when that happens with my credit card.

Started here.https://www.ether.fi/

Are you 100% sure this was the url you used???? This looks like the legit website. Check properly.

It does on everstake which is where I was last night but it seemed to time out and I assumed it never went through as all my eth was still in my wallet 8 hrs later. .I am very relieved to have found where it ended up
2
This is their main website, but the contract is not theirs. I believe you may have used a scam link by accident. Look at your browser history to get the website you used.

Pretty sure, my wallet is still connect d on this screen where I took the url from

So the coins show up?

Extremely high volume of activities on the mainnet right now, so the gas is super high. Probably wait a few days for things to settle.

Due to highly volatile price moves. The global stock market crashed.

People trying to move money around to exit during this crash or buy it up. Lots of activity during volatile times.

Theres a bunch going on right now in terms of the network, making ti busy and therefore making it expensive to transact

ethbtc ratio dying means that crypto is in a bear market, when we have bull market eth will pump vs btc. All historical data proves it
7
Last 2 to 3 years the trend is down, beyond that you'll see lower highs end higher lows, and trends tend to reverse at some point.... So eth/btc volatility has been  going down, but looking at the chart I see a strong sign this is about to change, and we'll see a breakout in max 6 months.
3
>Eth bagholder. ... Just follow your instinct then, and dump it while it's still worth something....Holding bags you don't believe in is nothing but frustration, and counter productive. You'll sell at the bottom otherwise anyway, so better do it asap, so you can focus on something you're good at.

Title: Is this likely a scam? They contact me to buy my artwork paying with ETH

Yes it probably is a scam. I copied this from the r/Scams list of common scams:.."This is a variant of the advance fee scam. The scammer will often use a stolen social media account to increase their credibility. A scammer will contact an artist, and ask to purchase one of their works of art (paintings, digital media or photos), and they will offer a generous sum of money. It can take three forms: a fake payment email (in which you're instructed to pay some fee to receive the money), a fake check (in which you're asked to forward some money elsewhere), or a fake NFT minting scam...In this latest variant, the scammer suggests to buy the art piece in NFT form. The victim is instructed to mint the NFT in a fake minting website, which charges money for the fuel (as any NFT minting service does). The difference is, the scammers control this fake website and run away with your money. After you mint the NFT, the scammer disappears without paying for the piece."
32
Very common scam that any artist who sells art on the internet eventually gets spammed with
5
Yes this is true.. you convert your art to a 8 bit pixel nft and people have spent 70mil or more on such things..but i dont know the proper process, im sure youtube has videos but their are ways to create NFTs and even put up for auction...further reading comments it morebthen likely is a scam, but you can in fact out your artwork as an NFT on a legit website and put uo for auction
2
I don't see why you wouldn't humor it, give them a contract that stipulates you must receive the ETH and transfer it to a second wallet before any transfer of rights is complete, then send an address to send the eth to if you're interested. someone school me on why this wouldn't work?
3
Yes, it’s true. I have encountered the same routine twice on instagram.
1
This is an RIP deal, where the scammers pose as a prospective client/investor but they need an advance fee or contribution before a further deal can be made...It's a scam
1
It’s a scam. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.
1
>"I'm willing to pay 2ETH for each artwork" just the phrasing sounds like a scammer - "2eth for each artwork"
1
Would just wend your walled address and wait
1
It was created as a “currency”. This one could be a scam but eventually crypto should be used as its name reads and not just buying and selling for profit like a stock.
1
I’m very sorry to tell you, yes, this is likely a scam. Every artist I know who has accessible work online has been contacted about buying their artwork “for NFT’s”. The dead giveaway is that they seem to choose 2 or 3 pieces at random, not necessarily the best or most universally accessible work. And they want to pay a crazy amount for them.
1
It’s a common scam. They want you to pay the fee to mint it on their site. Usually it’s a business promoting these assholes.
1
Agree with the stipulation that she send the eth to your wallet and when it clears a dex or cex then you will be happy to send the art. Don't agree to put up any upfront money to get the full amount and ask her to provide you her wallet address. Request she email you notification when she has sent the eth so you can follow the money transactions on etherscan.io. This will confirm she is legit.
1
It's probably a scam but if you wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, I would ask for a 0.1 Eth upfront deposit for your time and to establish good faith. Then they'll refuse or try to send you fake Eth and you'll know it's a scam, if they send real Eth it might not be a scam.
0
It’s not a scam. ETh just took a little dip but will go up to $4,000 a coin shortly.
-2
Yes. It’s a scam. No one wants your artwork

Just weird that people are into crypto and can't seem to understand that they scams are next level in approach or aggressiveness and if it sounds strange, it is? Why do you need to ask when you don't know the person?..I don't even look at them, and I get texts and emails every now and again...and wondering just how they got my contact info? But certainly don't engage. Because I own it and it's mine...If you think people that you don't know and that contact you about crypto in general are in it for your interests, maybe consider selling it back for cash and spend it on something else...."If it doesn't make sense it probably not true." -Judge Judith Sheinlin
-3
Sounds like this might be the case, good thing is that I didn't believe it to start with since the offering was too generous. I might go further to reach the point in which I have to pay something. I'll report back if I do. But what was fishy is that I asked her for a personal or company site to "visit" (to check her basically) and she said she hasn't has one. Thanks for the heads up.
12
Thanks for the input, I will learn about this. Maybe the scam ends up triggering something good.

ETH? That network with ridiculous gas fees that's not even POW anymore? Planning to be the L1 chain when Polygon is barely more than a buggy mess and arboretum is just ETH but worse? That ETH? When I could just use BNB or Avax for 100x faster transactions at 1/1000 the cost?

Seems like something a scammer would say, to reduce competition . .(I’m just kidding)
2
It’s a scam. Don’t go further, block them and move on.
14
If the offer is unreasonably good, it's a scam. The moment client sends you a link instead of payment, it's a scam. ..I sometimes waste their time with some long bullshit honeypot story and in the end ask them to lend me some money for "transaction fees". They always insta disconnect.
2
If u really want to move into the nft space safely, reach out to companies like opensea, or supermeta who helps artist get onto the nft space and then sell and market it for them... Source: I got supermeta to mint my art into nft and they market it for me. I pay on commission basis only (i.e they take a cut when they sell. Rest goes to me)
1
So theres 1 of 2 ways you can do this. So if yiur work is purely art, NFTs are the way to go..you can convert your art into an nft and sell it as i previously stated.. the new alternative is building a community around your art in the form of meme coins..and most meme coins still have nft collections. (Reason for this is nfts are a scam of the past and the newest 1 is meme coins.) If you decide to go memecoin route, i recommend this. Keep 1 wallet as your creator wallet.. the 1 people know is holding the token and guiding the community, the other wallet contains a moddest amount so you can reap some of the rewards and not just the community who sells... both ideas are a good way for extra income..only issue with nfts i think is harder to market and get people to see it..everything is set to advertise your memecoin these days
1
Ive seen people turn $200 into over 100k doing memecoins.. but memecoins is a nasty place..if your not mentally prepared it can tear you down.. id recommend joining a few TG communities before creating your own.. i once wanted to do a meme coin community...its alot more work then the stories tell you about lmao

On the offchance it's not a scam

“But what if it’s not a scam?” -Naive people, right before they get scammed.
0
It was recommended to me. ..I'm not sure polygon, Avax, or BNB count as scams anywhere near as much as eth does, though go on. I gain nothing from attempting to pump any of them because they'll just move with BTC like the rest of the industry. ..With that said, ever since leaving POW eth has killed it's only value prop.... That doesn't mean it's impossible to speculate on, just that it's a utility token backed by the least utility of its competition.
1
Yeah. Do it safely and don't pay for anything where possible until your nft is sold.

Lol, "inventing in 2015"
1
Yes. I started inventing Online Pseudonym Parties in 2015, was finished in 2018. If you think that's ridiculous it isn't a problem. It was based on Bryan Ford's Pseudonym Parties from 2008, although I first heard of the physical pseudonym parties via a forum post on the old Ethereum forum and was not aware it was published by Ford in 2008. Peace
2

0
all of it, whitepaper been around since 2018, [https://bitpeople.org/](https://bitpeople.org/), had thousands of downloads and tens of thousands of views while I still tracked that (stopped doing so years ago), very positive comments. if you think the design is so self-evident that no one could claim to have invented it, then that's ok too. peace

Not uhh "no one" just not anyone in 2015.
1
If your point is no one could have invented it in 2015. Well, I started to invent it then, August 2015. Ethereum had already released Frontier by then. I'd assume you were not following Ethereum back then? My project had quite a bit of coverage, it was mentioned in 2017 in the article usually said to have coined the "proof-of-personhood" term, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966966/](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966966/), and you'll find lots of things from 2016 such as https://www.the-blockchain.com/2016/04/23/blockchain-proof-individuality-anti-sybil-protocol-using-virtual-pseudonym-parties/. The design was not finished until 2018 though. If you reject my claim, that's fine I guess. Each to their own. Peace

"white paper"
0
Well, if you disagree it is a whitepaper, and you think it lacks any formal description of a system, as well as the source code for it, that's fine. I've had plenty of people who respect it, but it does not mean it is any good, and the good thing with electronic communication is that it is very easy for anyone to get access and verify and judge for themselves. No one has to feel tricked, anyone can make up their own mind. Peace

What the fuck is your problem
1
u/bonerJR Thanks for the support! He (studstill) is from a community of people who are convinced that blockchain technology is a scam, and this belief is central to their identity. Took me a few days to place who he was, his last comment narrowed it down a lot... I accidentally made some comment in their community forum a few months ago, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1cvwq0z/comment/l4vanqz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1cvwq0z/comment/l4vanqz/), and they'd pop up here after that too, see https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1cnr3oi/comment/l4w7t91/. So that's his problem with me (as in, it is not about me, he dislikes Ethereum and doing so is important to him). He rejects "blockchain" all the way back to 2008, and logically wouldn't see any potential or value in anything built on it, so my work couldn't pass as "real" no matter how good quality it was, because he has decided nothing in "blockchain" has value.
2
Semantics, it seems...Or reality...Mans said he "invented" "online psuedonym parties" in a "whitepaper" in "2015"...Those words are pretty far off from reality...He posted them on a site explicitly for representing reality with words...What's your fucking problem?.."Government"?

I'm a big fan of buttcoin and anti-crypto communities but using eth was loads of fun. Doing onchain stuff is cool and if you wanna make your own thing, more power to ya. The reason I like this sub so much is because people post actual little projects here (like this). I don't care if it's crazy or not...Thanks for the context, I was curious, he seemed so upset.

What are your thoughts on making play to earn fun and keeping it from turning into a grind/job, or being taken over by bots and farmers.
5
You’re asking an ethereum sub, you’re going to get biased answers. ..My biased answer for example is Base. If you’re more comfort in solidity build on the evm because you’ll build faster. Base is fast and cheap and they’ll support you with a builders grant likely.
5
Arbitrum Stylus  (L3) will let you use Rust as well on top of the Ethereum network.  .[https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart) ..I would personally prefer a game using the Ethereum stack.
4
I’ve been looking at play 2 earn for a few years. Solana has critical issues with its infra. As long as you don’t care about the game possibly going down, Solana could work. Most P2E are on evm chains or L1s
3
The most promising currently are EVM rollups like Arbitrum, Base, Zk-Sync, Linea, Optimism ect...From my perspective anything that can be easily bridged to/from ethereum mainnet is fine
2
Solidity/EVM is multi-platform, as many popular chains implement it.  If your game is compelling, people will play on any platform though.

With many information now, its good to have both

I have a new strategy based game, there is bot protection and ever increasing difficulty. Can’t say more.

> bot protection..If you set your economy right, botting would require same financial investment as regular gameplay. I'm still waiting for somone to implement economic protections rather than anticheat or captcha
2
Tbh it sounds like you haven't used Solana, or at least in the last few months. ...It's incredibly frustrating as a user that it takes multiple attempts to try and get your transaction to go through.
5
Solana users are moreso gamblers than people who test cool stuff. Base is for builders.
2
You are right, I just hold solana...Is this transaction failure issue due to solana’s network congestion or is it the wallet gateway issue? do you know?

I worry that if smart wallets are the defacto way to become quantum-secure we’ll start to lose a lot of self custody. It’s an excellent way to get people on chain without really realising it, but I wouldn’t want it to be the only way to be safe otherwise you’re relying on someone else’s smart contract in order to interact with the Ethereum mainnet...However I do agree that Proxy contracts are a good way forward, just not total account abstraction
2
I would really love to see a working smart wallet on mainnnet someday. Would be neat as a spender wallet.
1
Nope, forgery of BLS signature scheme could still occur. Ethereum won't be truly secure until either an upgrade to change the signature algorithm and/or convert every EOA to CA..[https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/future-proofing/](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/future-proofing/)
1
TBH 4337's primary goal is just to improve user experience, this quantum benefit is just a side effect. But yeah people would have to "trust" a contract implementation whereas nowadays they only have to trust themselves not to leak their key.
1
I’m a massive fan of account abstraction. I’ve had a difficult time helping other people realise why it is such a good thing. I’m building an app right now that uses smart wallets so that “normal users” can interact with the app without having to set up and connect their own wallet. It eliminates the barrier to entry. But we should still give people the choice to connect their own wallets too

I'm not an expert but I think the blockchain client should know what node to connect on its initialization. They are usually in some network config files hardcoded for the network you are connecting to. So, if you want to connect to your custom node first you should state it in the network config.
1
I believe you need to specify the chain ID of whatever you're trying to do. I'm not sure if you are trying to create your own EVM chain or if you're trying to run solidity code on an EVM chain. If it's the ladder, and you're trying to use a local geth/prism node to interact with, then you need to make sure the chain IDs and ports are configured. If you're trying to run on a test net, then you need to specify that (for instance sepolia or anvil)...If you're trying to run your own chain completely, then I'm not too sure how to do that.

A wallet on an excahnge is a custodial wallet, they are holding your funds for you on your behalf. This is differnt from any type of self custody wallet where you move the funds to metamask, or trezor, ledger etc. You dont get the keys to the type of wallet you described. ..If you ever heard the term "not your keys, not your wallet" this is the scenario most are talking about. ..You want you funds on a non-custodial or self custody wallet where only you have the seed phrase to the wallet.

Exchanges use hot and cold wallets. When you deposit funds a wallet is generated for you and deposits are allocated on a database, over time the funds are moved into their own, larger wallets. In the interim you could be trading, withdrawing etc., doesn't mean the money in that wallet is yours. Just that they haven't moved it to their hot or cold wallets. Banks work quite similarly.
1
is not your address
1
OP thought he discovered an infinite money bug where he could withdraw or use his money in an exchange yet still keep it in "his" address...
1
This address is a deposit address. This means that this address belongs to the exchange. When you deposited USDC into it, you should see it show up on your exchange account. The USDC is simply credited into your exchange account, but the exchange can decide to move it out of the deposit address when let’s say it satisfies a minimum amount to save gas fee. This means that this address can still hold USDC even though you’ve withdrawn your USDC from your exchange account.

🤣😩😂

thank you I understand the concept of keys and wallets. and how having your assets on an exchnage is way different to your own wallet such as hardware or metamask. ..I guess my question is a little more for the advanced. if you clicked on the etherscan.io link you'll see usdc token in that wallet. ..however the exchange wallet itself does not show these usdc tokens. my question is to reddit is if the exchange wallet lying to me? and those funds are actually available and do I have a chance of obtaining them?
2
the exchange is blofin, which doesnt provide wallet seed phrase. how would I be able to import that to metamask?
2
yeah I have it's safe.
1
this what I was looking for. thank you.
2
lol
1
that's not how it works?
1
Are you also saying you know the usdc funds are yours? Did you possibly sell some crypto into usdc and now cant access it? Sounds like reaching out to the exchange support would be the way to go...Also i would say the etherscan would be considered the source of truth to your claims to those funds. None of the suggestions i see are valid to import this to metamask because you dont hold the private key or have the seed phrase. The exchange would be the only entity to have that.
1
The wallet belongs to the exchange. Does the exchange support USDC? If not, it’s possible they can recover your funds but you will have to fight for it. If they do support USDC and it’s in your account but you cannot withdraw to your own wallet, you have likely been scammed.
1
If you don't know the private key, it's not your wallet. And you can't import it into, say, MetaMask. All you can do is maybe ask customer support your question.

Ever heard of trezor.

Ledger makes good hardware wallets. You can also use a multisig (safe) if you want to go the extra mile.

I would recommend Cypherock X1 hardware wallet. It’s audited, open source and verified reproducible. :!

If you're considering cold storage for Ethereum, skip the usual options like Ledger or Trezor. Gridlock offers superior security without the hassle of managing a physical device or seed phrase. It's more secure, easier to use, and eliminates single points of failure, making it the best choice for protecting your Ethereum.

It depends.  What is the memecoin address and I can tell you.  99% chance it is completely gone. 1% chance the contract never changed the owner to a null address and the creator has access to it possibly. 1% chance the memecoin creator will send you your money back.

Meme coins usually promote themselves via Twitter/Telegram/ other methods...The memecoin he accidentally sent ETH directly to had their social media connected to their Etherscan page.  It has their website as well as their Telegram information.  If the owner is a good person, this guy can possibly get his money back due to the way the contract is written.  Not all contracts are written this way, so he may get lucky.

Gas fees are not sent to random wallets...Someone has your 2nd wallet details and will just drain the account whenever you put funds in...Really with a balance of $25 you should be on an L2 and not on mainnet...Also follow security practices people are saying as it looks like your secondary wallet is compromised

Your secondary address is compromised, so it’s either not new, or you *do* have malware. No ifs and buts

Yeah, but the question was, why the balance is zero. And that's because of the outgoing transaction that used all the gas to transfer $0.01 worth of ETH probably...On top of that it's very likely the wallet has been compromised, yes.

what CEX are you using? what's your purpose in staking? because I'm keeping some of my ETH in a CEX that provides earning pools, and those are being ran by various methods such as automated trading products (fixed 5-11% yield in same coin),  fixed income products (fixed 6-8%), ETH launchpool (highly lucrative % yield earning newly ICO coins that I regularly convert to ETH right away daily/weekly, depends on that new coin price action). ..and yes, I'm liquid staking too at Renzo (arb network).

Restake it on ether.fi

You can buy stETH (Lido) or rETH (Rocket Pool) using a DEX on an L2. You can only mint directly on L1 but people have bridged it to L2 networks where you can buy and sell it.

Or you can stake them on L1 on a moment that gas is cheap.

Some of the restaking protocols are now on l2s. I originally used kelp Dao on eth mainnet to get into restaking my eth and avoid competing to get in when eigen increased limits. But now you can use kelp directly from multiple l2s to get rsEth. Renzo also does this now, maybe some others too.

true, only reason is that i want to keep it staked long term, so i want to avoid that if when i need to move it gas are high like in the past (e.g 100$), then i lose a meaningful % in fees

Yeah, Renzo is good, and it’s where I’m restaking my ETH with my FIL on Parasail.

It won't cost him to move it since it is on a Cex if he withdraws directly to an l2.

The first paragraph sends you to read something else if you don't understand, the second paragraph says:..>The most important trend in STARK protocol design over the last two years has been the switch to working over small fields. The earliest production implementations of STARKs worked over 256-bit fields - arithmetic modulo large numbers such as 21888...95617 \(\approx 1.51 * 2^{253}\) - which made these protocols naturally compatible with verifying elliptic curve-based signatures, and made them easy to reason about. But this led to inefficiency: in most cases we don't actually have good ways to make use of these larger numbers, and so they ended up as mostly wasted space, and even more wasted computation, since arithmetic over 4x bigger numbers takes ~9x more computation time. To deal with this, STARKs have started working over smaller fields: first Goldilocks (modulus \(2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1\)) and then Mersenne31 and BabyBear (\(2^{31} - 1\) and \(2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1\), respectively)...How would anybody who isn't directly involved in this stuff, have any idea WTF they're talking about?..This almost sounds like something an incel would make up at a cocktail party to impress a girl...If you guys want to make this tech accessible, you have to get your head out of this archaic mess that only a half dozen people care about.   What does this protocol actually do?  How difficult is it to explain it in useful terms?   Then again, I'm assuming there is utility someone could identify with, and that's probably my problem.

3
Hey thanks for the response. Am I correct in assuming that if I can't get them to accelerate or replace it then it will just be pending forever?
2
It won't be pending forever. After about 2 weeks it will fall out of the mempool (pending transactions list) and revert, or if gas prices fall within the bid by then it will be processed.
2
Yes, but there are a ton of similarly stuck transactions similar to yours from that wallet, so I'd be surprised if they just did nothing given the volume coming from it. Of course I don't know who "they" is though.
1
I had a transfer from 6 months ago succeed the other day, which I tried to make with a stupidly low fee. It was me trying to move some dust when emptying out the account which I haven’t used since. So, someone kept it in the mempool for half a year.

How can I do the following two tasks better/easier than using blockchain?..Task 1:.I want to make a piece of content - like a video or something - and I want to prove in the video itself that it happened after date/time X. .2 years later someone can say, oh but that video did not happen after date X it happend before date X. ..With blockchains (I can take my favourite one), and include hash of the latest block in the video in some form. ...Task 2:.Lets say I make a video and keep it secret and only release it in 2 years. How can I convice a reasonable person behind resonable doubt, that the video was created before date/time X...With blockchain I make a video, then create a hash of it and include the hash as a piece of data on chain; then for sure the video was created before the block the data was included in.
1
Here and below, you try to manipulate blockchain's uselessness rather than admit that the issue is completely different—it's not a network that develops projects and solutions on top of it, but people. Mostly, these people are not altruists; thus, they develop something that will profit them...And if mint to play app (just an example, no rocket science at all) will bring them money, they will do that! They won't push the boundaries and reinvent the wheel to satisfy some niche needs. ..Even if they want to build something worthy and unique, but there is no proper market (users ready to pay for it), only a few would do that contributing their time, money and dedication to something that won't pay off. And we should appraise these heroes, as they are the ones who really push this industry ahead...It's time to admit—it's for profits. And if you want to change the status quo, lead by example.

>No time and energy to grace you with a proper answer so here’s an easy one: no need to ask permission from the powers that be to use assets you own..First, that's a vague, un-specific abstraction...Second, it's also false...I prove that's false [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s) and I talk about why it's false both with Bitcoin and Ethereum specifically...This idea that you don't have to "ask permission" to use your assets is absurd.  You are leaving out literally dozens of third parties whose resources you need to even access your crypto.  ..Just being able to access the Internet itself, isn't some universal human right that's available to all.  You take it all for granted...It's utterly mind boggling how and why you'd suggest crypto is "P2P when no two peers involved in a transaction even contact each other.  They all go through a myriad of third party middlemen, and if those people weren't there, you'd have *nothing*.  I've never seen a network that had more points of failure and more unnecessary intermediaries, than blockchain.
-1
> Task 1: I want to make a piece of content - like a video or something - and I want to prove in the video itself that it happened after date/time X..This is called "authentication" and you guys act like you invented it.  I hate to break it to you but it's been around long before blockchain.  The technology that blockchain uses for "authentication" does not require blockchain: It's called cryptographic hashing and it's been in use routinely to authenticate content.  You don't need Eth or blockchain to do that.  Since the dawn of computing, it's been used.  It's most basic level started the moment two computers started talking to each other with something called "checksums" which were used to authenticate data in both directions...Again, there's *nothing* blockchain brings to that.   You can use a regular database to keep track of the same data, and you can hash date and timestamps as well...>and I want to prove in the video itself that it happened after date/time X..Funny thing about dates and times.  Blockchain doesn't give a shit about time.  It doesn't keep track of dates and times, only blocks.  Dates and times are a function of... wait for it... *central authorities* like the National Institute of Standards and Time, which servers all over the world use for synchronization.   So at virtually every point in the blockchain process, it's dependent upon central authorities who use their services *with permission*...> 2 years later someone can say, oh but that video did not happen after date X it happend before date X. ..Assuming the dates are accurate, and if they are, they will be the result of two specific, non-decentralized entities:..1.  The person who input the data to the blockchain (oracle #1).2.  The date/time authority that (i.e. time.nist.gov) that gave the server the correct date/time...Again, all of this can be done with traditional databases faster and cheaper.  ..Another problem is, there's no guarantee your blockchain will be operational two years from now.  There is no guarantee the random, anonymous, self-interested node operators will continue to run the nodes.  Since there is no accountability in crypto due to its decentralized nature, there's nobody in charge to make sure the blockchain keeps running.  The moment the value of the tokens drops low enough, long enough, then there's no incentive anymore for the blockchain to exist.  There are already 30,000+ copies of BTC and ETH that no longer exist because nobody is running their blockchains any more.   Just because Eth is popular now, doesn't mean it will be in the future.  You have no guarantee of that...>Task 2: Lets say I make a video and keep it secret and only release it in 2 years. How can I convice a reasonable person behind resonable doubt, that the video was created before date/time X...This is basically the same argument as your earlier argument.  Those hashes don't need to be stored on blockchain - they can be stored in various other places.  ..And of course, any concept of "dates" and "times" is a function of central authorities, so ironically you can't exercise your fantasy scenario without depending upon middlemen that are regulated and subsidized by government...So, your argument fails...* It fails because it does not do anything better than what we already have.* It fails because it depends on various centralized/entities to report what is the proper date/time (The Oracle Problem)..Sorry.   Try again.

There's not a single one that's competitive with non-blockchain versions.  There's a reason for this: blockchain adds nothing useful or desirable that other people want.  It's just a gimmick to support a ponzi scheme...And I remain open minded.  I ask for people to prove me wrong.  All they end up doing is hurling personal insults instead.

You are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition of crypto (and specifically a chain like Ethereum)..You are thinking of it purely in terms of technological replacement value. As in, how is the technology better at doing a specific task than the technology that exists today? Crypto is net new technology. It isn’t like AI, which is an incremental improvement - computers doing what we could already do better and more efficiently...The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. It’s coordination at a global scale. To use your database argument as an example, Ethereum isn’t trying to just be a database, it’s trying to be THE database. A singular world computer - a source of truth for all transactions that ever happen in the world. There’s tremendous value in that...Does it sound crazy? Yes. Does it sound impossible? Yes. But so did the idea of the internet in the early days. There were many people that uttered the same criticisms 40 years ago - “why do we need the internet when televisions and the radio exists?” ..Sounds pretty familiar to “why do we need crypto when databases and auth already exist?” ..Source: I am a seasoned software engineer that has deep domain knowledge on one of the most popular database technologies in the world. I understand databases and authentication at a deeper level than 99% of engineers. These technologies are quite literally our modern day radio and television. They serve our needs and purposes today, but they are horribly inefficient for coordinating at a global scale. I’m not saying Ethereum or any other crypto has gotten even close, but a secure source of truth “database” for the entire world is a game changer.

> You are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition of crypto (and specifically a chain like Ethereum)..Ok... let's see you explain to me what I'm not understanding?..>The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. ..This is a vague abstraction.  ..You guys love to talk in vague abstractions because it's difficult to qualify your ambiguous claims as being true/false when they're so un-specific.   ..What is "consensus" in the context of crypto?  You don't answer that.  ..How is "consensus" qualified off chain?  You don't answer that.  ..You pretend the whole world runs on Solidity, which is absurd.  You haven't drawn a single, clear line of how what happens on blockchain, results from any meaningful form of "consensus" in the real world...And yes, even with your vague techno-babble, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  I have a section in my documentary where I specifically debunk your claims [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=916s)...You hide behind Begging the Question logical fallacies.  Two in particular in this argument:..1.  Decentralizing something is supposed to be inherently better - You haven't proven that.  I debunk that claim [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=783s)..2.  Consensus works in the world of crypto and blockchain - I debunk that in the earlier link, which is all part of my section on decentralization and what it promises and why it doesn't deliver...13 minutes into my documentary, I address this issue.  I go into explicit details on how and why blockchain isn't decentralized in any meaningful way.  I also explain that blockchain's consensus mechanism is flawed and incomplete...So while you say..>The promise of crypto is decentralized consensus. ..You don't go into any specifics on how that argument actually works.  I have, and it falls apart when you apply it to any real world application...At [35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2108s) in my documentary I go into a very specific use-case for blockchain that's very commonly cited: supply chain tracking.  We take a real world example of how blockchain would be used, and I prove blockchain adds *nothing* of value to the application.  Nobody has found any faults in my arguments or evidence, which is why I just get called names - my data is solid.  ..>Does it sound crazy? Yes. Does it sound impossible? Yes. But so did the idea of the internet in the early days. There were many people that uttered the same criticisms 40 years ago - “why do we need the internet when televisions and the radio exists?” ..Again, with absolutely ABSURD ANALOGIES...From the moment the Internet, radio or television was invented, the value it brought to society was obvious.  We didn't need people saying for 15 years, "Just wait... the internet will do cool stuff you need!"   From the moment the Internet came along, we recognized services like e-mail were a dramatic improvement over existing tech like US Mail and fax machines.   Even though it took many years for the Internet to propagate to more people, the value of the tech *was obvious from the very beginning*...The same can **not** be said for blockchain...Stop pretending blockchain has anywhere near the potential of actually disruptive technology.  That's a lie...>Source: I am a seasoned software engineer that has deep domain knowledge on one of the most popular database technologies in the world. I understand databases and authentication at a deeper level than 99% of engineers. These technologies are quite literally our modern day radio and television. ..I'm a software engineer too, and I can quite confidently state, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about...I produced a [detailed documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA) filled with specific examples and references that debunk all the bullshit talking points you've made...I've also interviewed well-regarded computer science experts like [Dr. Nicholas Weaver](https://ioradio.org/2023/07/25/io-radio-13-interview-with-computer-science-professor-and-crypto-critic-dr-nicholas-weaver/) at Berkeley who 100% agrees with me about blockchain...All you do is make bad analogies, fallacious claims, and avoid anything specific enough to be tested true/false...You should quit your day job and find another line of work because if you think blockchain is like tv or radio, you're not qualified to build any type of mission critical technology.

I like Bitwise's ETF, ETHW. 0.2% fee, plus they've pledged to donate part of their profit to open source ETH devs, plus their addresses are public and labeled with ENS domains. They're the most "crypto-aligned" ETF issuer, IMO.
14
Bitwise Ether ETF (ETHW) or, in Canada, 3iQ's Ether Staking ETF (TSX:ETHQ)
3
Grayscale’s ETH has the lowest fees. Don’t know if I necessarily endorse Grayscale, but that’s what I went with. I also had ETHE before so I was always going to get shares of ETH.
2
The best one is the one with no fees aka spot.
2
Tax incentives on crypto is better than stocks but most of the long and short term capital gains are the same but with crypto you can sell your losses and right them off completely with no limits like $3k stocks have (as of now)

Why would you not have to worry about taxes?
1
Not sure why people would buy a ETF instead of self custody.

[Here's a breakdown ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/s/W7BBhAU5ww)

FETH has no fee until January 1, 2025.

I also got ETH from my ETHE holdings. What was this for? Was it to make up for the discount that existed before the ETF came out? Thanks!
2
OP is probably referring to holding the ETF in a tax advantaged account, like a Roth IRA
6
I assume it's because the ETFs will give you tax forms indicating what your obligations are, rather than having to calculate them yourself.
1
I think Fidelity does self custody with their crypto ETF’s
1
Hardly seems worth giving up self custody for some tax forms.
2
Well, of course they have the token, he means SELF custody. Not 3rd party

Agreed

Just import into metamask and send it off to an exchange.

You can do offline transactions with these, use something like myetherwallet and sign the transactions on an offline computer
3
First, be very skeptical of everyone and anyone giving you an answer. Second, trust the people who actually wrote the software you are using. In order to open those files go to the go-ethereum github repository. Under the /cmd directory there is a program named ethkey - see here: [https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/ethkey](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/ethkey)..If you build this program, you can decrypt these keys if you know the password. This is a command line interface program. Once you have built the program you can open the files like this:..ethkey inspect KEYFILE --private..To use it replace KEYFILE with the actual filename...If you do not know how to build a go based program, you can learn super easy. First, install go by using their website:..[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)..Once installed you can download the repository for go-ethereum and navigate a command line interface program to the go-ethereum source code location. Then navigate to the /cmd/ethkey directory. Once in that directory, you can just type:..go run . KEYFILE --private..This works to just run the ethkey program without installing and building it by having go build it in memory and run the program for you to use. If you have questions about any of these steps, just ask. Happy to help on the details. ..The reason I am suggesting this route is that all of the resources I am naming are nothing more than a well known programming language ( goLang ) and the actual go-ethereum repository - which is made by the ethereum core devs. In this way you do not have to trust anyone other than the devs who make go, and the devs who made ethereum. ..Once you have that private key, you can import it to any number of wallets including metamask, etherwallet, etc. ..If you are dealing with small values metamask is probably fine. If you are dealing with large values, look for other wallet like etherwallet. ..ALWAYS VERIFY YOU ARE DOWNLOADING THE ACTUAL WALLET FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE. ..Also, if using metamask, install it on a second browser that you use for nothing other than metamask.

Also - damn... just noticed your keyfiles are named 2016-\*\*\*  .Congrats on probably being crypto rich AF since those are old AF keys

A smart contract can't enforce anything that's not on the blockchain. It can record what commitments he makes, but given how many things he says are clearly false ( [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-rnc-speech](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-rnc-speech) ), I think we can safely conclude people don't actually care if he lies, as long as he's their liar.
7
>Does Trump know a smart contract can hold him to his word? ..The entire premise of this post just makes me laugh.
2
Hopefully he will lose in November and it won’t be necessary.
3
There isn’t a way to write a smart contract that holds president trump to his word.
2
Its impossible. Everything that is not digital will inevitably need a trusted third party, breaking the fundamental design philosophy of blockchain tech, reducing the claim to not being a use case for block chain tech.
1
You could if you use an oracle or sorts
-2
😂😂😂😂😂😂 yea Kamala much better 🤡
-14
That just tells the smart contract that the criteria aren't met (and it's not like Trump's defined what "crypto capital of the planet" entails, anyway), it can't do anything about it.

The oracle informs the blockchain. Oracles do not act.

Moron or fascist? Both are socially unacceptable, you know. You should work on that.

True, but say the outcome of assets locked in a contract was dependent on the result from a trusted oracle. In that case you can hold people financially accountable for actions made outside of the blockchain.

For gay people tbh

Would be interesting to hold elected officials’s salaries in smart contracts and release based on if they up held the promises made when elected.

Sure but now you have to convince Trump to deposit all his money into a smart contract *designed to keep him accountable*. I reckon the chances of that happening are slim to none.
-1
Stupid ass comment

Both, I see.
1
There's another problem with your idea: how can an oracle determine if a promise was met?  Not all promises are made to be measured objectively .Who hosts the oracle? Who designs the logic of the oracle? Who controls the oracle? ...The smart contract would really just be an extra step if the oracle is controlled by someone influenced by Trump.
1
I’m just discussing possibilities using blockchain, actually going about holding trump to his word is not achievable

Dude this is a ethereum forum

Ever heard of optimistic oracles? Users make proposals on the result putting up their collateral. Then there is a dispute period where anyone can dispute the proposed result, various methods on this dispute process exist. If the proposal is proven or voted to be false, then the proposer loses collateral they put forth...In order to for it to properly work, the promises have to be laid out clearly and unambiguous with clear definitions on how the result would be determined. Like if they say they will lower crime, then they would present a trusted source that reports crime rates as what would be used to determine that...You would also require the proposer of the result to put up potentially more collateral than would be received by the party in question if passed...Take a look at how polymarket determines the results of bets, they use an optimistic oracle with a fair amount of success...Edit: spelling

This convo is irrelevant to the forum unless it pertains to crypto but that idiot had to make it partisan (who started this comment thread)...Regardless the dems would’ve made eth a security and had a bunch of back and forth legal battles with the SEC before approving the ETFs, Trump single-handedly forced their hand to approve it and wants to create a BTC strategic reserve. Bullish for crypto as now all the other altcoins won’t get scrutinized either ..Countertrade the party of censorship 🦅🇺🇸

L2s are already awful to work with and turn away new users, I can't imagine how having an L3 would help increase adoption.

Blockchain and simplicity are two words that never go together
1
layer 1 zero scaleability..layer 2 a garanteed exit scamm  ...wonder how crypto is not dead yet to be honest.
-2
Well, just imagine having to interact with one protocol while doing different defi transactions in the background, on a single interface. You might also not need to use different tokens too and you get access to liquidity, trades, staking pool etc. That's the vision of L3. We're still in the early stages tho
4
**yet** just as large file transfer at some point required knowledge of FTP or keeping two devices in sync (rsync) now you use your google photo in multiple devices, or connecting to network device required knowledge of DNS and static IP before hotstname.local (zeroconf) it is the all work seamlessly today and there is no reasone for blockchain related NOT to work seamlessly .. if you've in your wallet $100 USDC on arbetram and $500 on optimism and $600 on base there is no reason for average user not to be able to make one payment of $1000 for something without the need to move funds manually .. advanced option will always be available for advance users but average user don't need to worry about a lot of if not most of what happening on the worker/app/protocol level things
2
I believe one day blockchain will redefine simplicity and make financial transactions way more easier than it is rn. I mean isn;t that what we expected from the technology?
1
With all due respect, what you have just said, if given to any person on the street they'll probably just stare blankly or panic and then run away calling for help...I have been dabbling with bitcoin, ethereum and other coins since about 2018, few years on and off and I still have no idea about half of what you have said...And this is what was meant by turning away new users - how L3 is going to help...From my POV, and please do correct me, this is all developer / programmer with some accounting / finance playground. Aside from understanding how money works, any other layperson will have a seriously hard time trying to understand what a blockchain or defi is, why they should spend their time to learn it / use it, let alone any hopes of learning what L3 is.
2
Zero chance of that happening. Blockchains purpose was never ease of payments. Its purpose is to circumvent banks and ownershi. Blockchain is already complicated given MEV, transaction bids, and a host of other factors baked into its very fundamentals. ..How can it get any simpler than what it is right now? We get zero transaction fees with 3rd party security. Assuming regular fiat technology progresses alongside blockchain, I have little hope blockchain will ever be easier than fiat. It’s best hope is a parallel economy.
1
Yeah, I completely understand your opinion here. Non-crypto natives will still find it hard to navigate the blockchain/defi space but we can't argue against the fact that the innovations we've seen so far in the crypto space has been really helpful in addressing the challenges we've had in the ecosystem. ..L3 might not be a popular (I doubt if it'll ever be) but absolute cross-chain interoperability (if possible) will open more opportunities in the ecosystem.
2
Hmm, complexity is a feature that comes early with any new technology. Let's see what the future brings tho. For me, I find it way more convenient to have my transactions on blockchain and crypto than the tradfi. Personal opinion tho. So, I look forward for more blockchain solutions
2
Oh I am excited at the prospects of the tech and innovations and how they handle and attempt to solve what was 'broken' with the old systems, even though I don't understand like 80% even after looking into and experimenting with it for about 6 years (and being excited with, but unable to get hold of some since Bitcoin first came out in 09 until '18)...To me, it's kinda like talking about TCP/IP in the 1980s. We can sing all the things that we would be able to do with that protocol in the future, nobody except the select few nerd understands it and takes the time to learn it, and there's nothing really that solid or compelling to show for it for the layperson...So in the blockchain / defi / etc world we need the evolution equavalent to internet, WWW and then iPhones and apps...At least that's my understanding of it...It's just that the whole sphere is filled with jargons, memes, uncertainty, lingo, memes, technicalties, regulations, de-regulations, governments scrutinizing, and large amount of people on the streets of either not caring / unable to comprehend or knowing but misunderstanding everything.

For an ERC20, I just check the contract and make sure they didn't put malicious code in it. I also avoid blacklist tokens outside of RWA's like USDC...Functions can be anything, named anything, do anything, ERC20 is merely an interface for required functions. What those functions do are up to the developer.

"blacklist tokens outside of RWA's like usdc'..keen to elaborate?

USDC has a blacklist, meaning they can blacklist any account they want from using any of their native USDC contracts. I use USDC because it's US regulated so I have some trust in them.

Privacy is a human right and I refuse to follow any argumentation suggesting that every Tornado Cash user does illegal things. We need transaction privacy too
64
>tornado-tainted coins..This doesn't make any sense, specially with Ethereum's account model as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO. Someone sent Blackrock 0.1 ETH from Tornado, does that mean they're tainted? If they sent 1000 ETH somewhere, will that include the tainted 0.1 ETH? Why or why not?
12
So, every dollar used in illegal purchases of drugs, firearms, whatever should be permanently "tainted"? That seems ridiculous to me.
34
>Each time they use it, they end up releasing tornado-tainted coins into the wild, and some of these would surely end up leaking into innocent user hands...Worth noting Tornado Cash has only been sanctioned in the USA. It's 100% legal to use everywhere else in the world. If you by chance end up with 'tainted' crypto, there are billions of people willing and able to take it off your hands at spot prices - through any DEX...Even Tornado Cash's Polygon contract was not sanctioned in the US, nor were its 101 forks. The DOJ seemingly had no issue with TC or privacy itself inherently, moreso North Korea, and there have been 0 charges laid against 'legitimate' use of the protocol since sanctioning it - 0 accusations for holding 'tainted' crypto. ..OFAC has stated they are not prioritizing enforcement against individuals who've used Tornado Cash unless other sanctioned activity is present. Even CEXs themselves act as a sort of Tornado Cash proxy and wash the trail clean...Surely some of your coins were involved with a darknet marketplace, hack, theft, or some other crime in the past, if you look back in history far enough. It's unavoidable. Imagine where all your cash bills have been before. Taint is an intrinsic nature of anything with value. But crypto, like cash, is fungible for the most part. No one's going to accuse you of being an illegal arms dealer because your coins were once used that way 10 years back, unless there's stronger evidence or circumstances that suggests otherwise. 'Tainted coins' haven't been an issue yet before, I think you'd be grasping to find this being an issue in the future...If they sanction XMR and zero knowledge proofs then I'd reconsider my stance. I think this is a nonissue as of now.

The problem getting involved with tc is that they could be flagged by an exchange in a trade and your bag gets locked up for six months. There is way too much surveillance of crypto but that's the way it is.

Cryptocurrency is based on consensus; censorship can only occur through fragmentation.  As gov't fiat enters the game, the entire crypto world will split into two systems: auditable and non-auditable (Light and Dark).  The former will be strictly regulated but enjoy interoperability with traditional financial systems, while the latter will be confined to P2P/DEX systems and heavily villified as "dark money", in order to preserve gov't ability to devalue the currency...Currency devaluation is a requirement of consumption-based Keynesian economics because it disincentivizes saving.  In fiat, currency devaluation is typically achieved via inflation (increasing the total money supply).  In Light, it will happen via opaque stablecoin collateralization strategies.  Ideally, Dark would be the anchor which limits the rate of devaluation of Light currencies via exchange rate: the immediate public knowledge of the actual value of money (similar function to how gold, forex, etc. does now with fiat, but more accurate and without latency)...When Dark becomes the oracle for the true value of Light, the Light stablecoins lose their pegs, and the US gov't loses its ability to control the ecosystem through stablecoin manipulation.  When the gov't can no longer manipulate incentives with stealth-tax via devaluation, it is forced to budget responsibly; the Keynesian Casino closes and the USD-based world economy collapses.  Unacceptable.  They will first try to impede Dark-Light trades via regulation, e.g. sanctioning of Tornado Cash, backdooring CEXs, etc... and failing that, will use every weapon at their disposal to shutdown, invalidate, and arrest Dark nodes, wallets, and users...Meanwhile, if you wish to stay in good graces with Light, you should really be making a new wallet for every transaction to avoid inadvertently tainting yourself with Darkness.  In this way, you can continue to operate in both systems.  Imagine you wish to purchase groceries at a store which only accepts Light, but your aggregate Light balance is insufficient and you need to pull tokens from your Dark balance.  You will need to use a cross-ramp to transfer from Dark to Light, in a way which is invisible to the grocery store...The gov't will do everything in its power to prevent cross-ramps in the name of fighting money laundering, and it will likely play out in a cat-and-mouse game between Light and Dark actors, as new categories are invented which semantically dodge those of the laws and regulations.  Light will eventually win this game (by cheating via corrupt judiciary) and Dark will be confined to bartering systems.  This is why a lot of old school crypto enthusiasts are warning you to stop participating in these emergent systems, and stressing the importance of shortening your supply chain, meeting local farmers, and encouraging open source hardware / DIY.

There are quite a few privacy plays coming up, specifically zk rollups like OffShift. I agree that transaction privacy is monumentally important.

Can't inject logic into a place there is none to begin with. To sanction a permissionless protocol doesn't make a bit of sense...If you were dusted you cannot move those coins from your wallet as a US citizen or corporation. If you have 1000 ETH and were dusted 0.01 ETH then you must keep 0.01 ETH in your wallet at all times...You also have to file a report with OFAC *annually*... basically just to let them know you still haven't moved the coins. If you do move the coins, even by mistake, *you* become sanctioned then need to deal with OFAC to get off that list...OFAC has stated they are not prioritizing enforcement action against people over this without additional sanctioned activities being present. I seriously doubt more than a very small handful of degens have gone ahead with the annual reports, just the few who have lawyers on payroll...You can submit for a special license to be able to move your Tornado Cash coins, or even to continue to use the protocol itself, something Blackrock has assuredly done by now...https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/updated/2022-11-08..Lots of good info on that link.

You can’t track where every dollar ever used has been spent. You can tack transactions on a blockchain.
10
That's actually how it is. By law.   .Obviously in practice it does not work in this way. Mostly as it's too hard to keep track of.   .With cryptos however it's not hard too keep track of...   ..Essentially one of the reasons why I'm a fan of Monero

>Worth noting Tornado Cash has only been sanctioned in the USA...And even that probably won't hold up in court, especially after Chevron Deference was overturned. The idea that software can be put on a list statutorily designated for people was ridiculous, and only holds up when you let regulatory agencies decide whether or not the rules they wrote follow the law.
5
>Worth noting Tornado Cash has only been sanctioned in the USA. It's 100% legal to use everywhere else in the world. If you by chance end up with 'tainted' crypto, there are billions of people willing and able to take it off your hands at spot prices - through any DEX...Unless US hegemony recedes significantly, this won't always be the case.  Consider the plight of US expatriates, who are unable to open bank accounts in any country which bends the knee to the IMF, and are still forced to pay taxes to US IRS even sans citizenship.  You are never rid of them.  The money mafia simply hasn't gotten around to propagating it to the rest of its tentacles, yet.
2
The great irony is a person can use cash to wash dirty crypto hahaha

*"OFAC has stated they are not prioritizing enforcement against individuals who've used Tornado Cash unless other sanctioned activity is present. Even CEXs themselves act as a sort of Tornado Cash proxy and wash the trail clean"*

Thank you for this submission. I believe you have started a very accurate working model of the evolution of cryptocurrency in the next 36 months. The split of the crypto-verse into the light and dark sides is indeed inevitable. Big finance simply cannot co-exist with anything it cannot control or mitigate. I wish you would add to your post to explain how Big Finance will attack the characteristics of censorship resistance, immutability and decentralization in order to force domesticate cryptocurrency. ..I have come to the realization that the greatest weakness of Big Finance is their arrogance manifested by US global economic dominance. Maybe that weakness is the pathway to an equilibrium between the light and dark sides. Unfortunately, the inequality in bargaining positions is only going to grow for the foreseeable future.
3
Plausible deniability really would fix the problem, and is similar to what would happen if tornado coins tainted the majority of eth.
1
tel us you don’t understand immutability without telling us you don’t understand immutability.

That's why they want CBDC, but the point remains the same I feel. If the monetary exchange of choice is used for something illegal, is the monetary exchange of choice the thing that should be tainted?
4
You must be a biden lover to believe this bs. Tick tocks in every agency of gov't surveil everyone all the time.  It is buffoonish to think otherwise. But ofac promised! Lol
1
I would temper your expectation that the immutability of cryptocurrency is going to grant any direct benefit.  It's just an implementation detail of blockchains.  Ethereum launched with the motto "Code is Law".   Shortly after, a poorly written DAO smart contract caused a majority of Western Ethereum developers to lose a lot of tokens.  If code is law, this should have been fine.  But then the real principle emerged: consensus.  ..The Western Ethereum community decided by consensus to hard-fork into a new blockchain which excludes the immutable hash of the block containing the transaction produced by fair-use of a smart contract beyond its author's intent.  All of the existing Ethereum ecosystem acted in accord: block explorer websites, core devs, client devs, node operators, CEXs.  They all adopted modified clients which honor the fork-point.  In Eastern Europe, the "hackers" and their friends, along with some Westerners who naively still think "code is law", created new infrastructure to support the original blockchain, dubbing it Ethereum Classic (ETC).  Thus one consensus split into two...Sure they can't take your tokens, but consider what happened to anybody who accepted payment in ETH paid out by the hacker's wallet directly after the exploit.  Some innocent recipients such as merchants, grocers, bankers, etc. who happily accepted ETH suddenly had their token relabeled as ETC and instantly devalued.  ETC is currently worth < 1% of ETH...Nobody is attacking immutability; that's just math.  They're attacking consensus via censorship to cause fragmentation...As far as censorship via blacklisting: it is sidestepped rather easily by generating new wallets for every transaction.  Aside from attacking cross-ramps (difficult game) Light may decide to gatekeep wallet creation (easy bookkeeping task), either through issuance which requires submission of your gov't ID/SSN, or providing a registration service for new wallets.  You could still generate your own wallet, but it would be Dark by default.  It would no longer be "auditable vs non-auditable" but "registered vs unregistered", which is much easier to regulate.

1
This is something that needs to be worked on. When the staking spec was first realized ETH was trading around $100, so the emergence and sudden dominance of staking pools wasn't a large concern at the time...https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/staking_2023_10..https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/09/30/enshrinement.html..>In the short term, one option is to socially encourage ecosystem participants to use a diversity of liquid staking providers, to reduce the chance that any single one becomes too large to be a systemic risk. In the longer term, however, this is an unstable equilibrium, and there is peril in relying too much on moralistic pressure to solve problems. One natural question arises: might it make sense to enshrine some kind of in-protocol functionality to make liquid staking less centralizing?..It's a hot research topic today but not really anyone's priority right now. Reminder, it requires 66.67% of all ETH stake to "51% attack" the network in a similar way to Bitcoin. Once PBS goes live (to 'solve' MEV centralization concerns) I believe this will become the next target for all-hands-on development...One proposal that should go through before any real 'fix' is deployed will enable better protections and controls for delegates (ie stETH and rETH holders). Though the research topics escape my mind right now...The reason Bitcoiners don't believe 2 pools controlling 51% of the hashrate is an issue, but point to it being an issue in Ethereum's POS, is miners are able to stop contributing toward a malicious pool and redirect their hashrate in the event of an attack, whereas ETH delegates more or less have their ETH held hostage at the attacking validator's mercy...Currently only a validator has the ability to unstake their node. The research I've read aims to enable delegates the function to force their validators to unstake and exit. In the event a staking pool turns malicious (or goes offline) LST holders would be able retrieve their ETH simply by withdrawing/redeeming LST for ETH via smart contract. This would be done without permission or waiting for the validator to exit on their own, in turn removing the malicious validators from the network. This would at least offer Ethereum LST the same protection miners have against malicious POW pools. I think this won't be contentious or complicated and should come soon (TM) long before any seriously robust solution is figured out...However, I've never liked the assumption miners (or stakers) are paying careful attention to their nodes on a block-by-block basis. I think Bitcoin is still hugely susceptible to being 51% attacked today (which according to the Nakomoto coefficient, is any disruption to the network). Knowing most miners/stakers are ignorant/hands-off/idle/on vacation/greedy/lazy/etc. relying on them to take action the second an attack occurs is massively niave, so I'd hope a better solution emerges soon still (possibly some form of LST Enshrinement as per Vitalik's blog above)...Myself, I think the attack vector is growing. If these new US ETFs accumulate say $100B ETH then convert to staked ETFs, it would make Lido seem totally decentralized in contrast. One defense against this is the staking queue, meaning it would take some years for that much ETH to convert to staked ETH, but I'd rather people didn't wait until last-minute to decide this may become problematic.
6
Have you tried googling Ethereum staking centralization?  That seems like a place to start on educating yourself.
-3
In Proof Of Stake only requires 33,3% of total stake and Lido actually have 28,9%...Source: [https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking)..[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/#attackers-with-33-stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/#attackers-with-33-stake)
-3
Most likely will yield terrible results.
9
33.34% of the total stake and an attacker can stop Ethereum from finalizing transactions. It's worth mentioning here that Bitcoin never achieves finality and its blockchain is instead only ever 'probabilistic', which is why people and exchanges wait 30-60+ minutes before saying a BTC transaction is (probably) correct. Ethereum didn't achieve finality for the first time until it migrated to POS, most (POW and POS) chains don't have finality at all...Without achieving finality, Ethereum POS starts to bleed all stakers with inactivity leaks. This gradually would push the 33.34%'s stake downward until they no longer have 33.34% control, at which point the network would achieve finality and carry on as normal again. Losing even 0.1% of the total ETH stake is a massive cost, about $120M currently, and if a 33.34% attacker attempts to fork or manipulate the chain they would lose 100% of their stake via automated slashing...This defense mechanism is explained in much better detail on the Ethereum link you posted. ..Without finality, users would not notice any difference in their day to day transactions. The blockchain would still be 100% live during that sort of event. It would not really disrupt the network, other than stakers vocal outrage as they're experiencing inactivity leaks due to some other malicious entity...There was actually a bug in the Prisym client a few months back that prevented Ethereum from achieving finality, that was quickly fixed, but it meant the chain didn't achieve finality for about an hour. Few noticed...At any point up to 66.667%, due the nature of POS, there could be a social slashing event. This means people vote the attacker out of the network by forking the chain without the attackers validator set being part of the new fork. I don't think it'd be needed during a 33% attack, but it's still a viable option. In contrast to POW where it's impossible to remove an attacking entity without changing the hashing algorithm, which would render current ASICs useless and destroy its whole security model...All that said, I personally consider Lido to be a malicious entity themselves. Most staking pools have voted to self-limit their share to 22% but Lido has stated they see no issue if they controlled 100%. There's research and work being done on how to mitigate this risk, relying on altruism isn't a real solution. One proposal aims to reduce rewards to colluding validators which would give the free market incentives not to use them. Still, a permanent solution to totally prevent self-centralization (even just to the point of 33%, but at least 66%) is hard to imagine.

Kraken pro for sure
10
Kraken any day. And tangem for cold storage, it’s amazing!
13
I use coinbase - kraken doesn't provide proper transaction reports in pdf. I need proof of transactions for the tax related purposes
3
Kraken fees are much better and it's just a much better UX/UI overall.  Coinbase has a muddled business model; they are really only useful as an on/off-ramp, and even that process is a bit murky, such as suddenly instituting fees for PayPal transfer and doing it through a personal PayPal email of one of their staff-members, such that PayPal will put your money on IRS-hold (they refuse to recognize it as self-account to self-account transfer)...Sorry for the tangent, but yeah: Kraken all the way.
6
Stay away from gemini.
2
I wouldn't use a stop loss on kraken. They've had some substantial departures from the norm price before. One time when eth was like 1600 and dropped to 1200 or something everywhere...kraken dropped to like 200 bucks. Their order book was wiped with cascading sales.  It was years ago. Numbers might be different but it was like a 600 dollar difference if I recall. 
2
Kraken offers a much better user experience imo...But if you already know how to store seed phrase, metamask might be a better option. It has staking, doesn't overcharge you transaction fees (that's my biggest problem with Kraken). You can explore defi whenever you want. Switch to Base network and every transaction is < 1 cent.
2
You can stake on talisman for +16% for DOT
3
Please note that the real staking yield of polkadot is 0, pre-taxes. And negative once you pay taxes...Don't be fooled by the very high staking yields, they come from dilution. And in Polkadot everyone stakes, which makes the real yield effectively 0. And on top you will have to pay income taxes.
3
I wouldn’t invest in DOT, it’s a dead chain
4
Trust wallet or exodus wallet
2
I prefer to buy ETH and withdraw it to the arbitrum or optimism networks. last time I checked, the withdrawal fees were higher at kraken than they were at coinbase. take that into consideration. ..and since you seem to only be familiar with bitcoin, you may not be aware of liquid staking derivatives. I would highly recommend to purchase rETH on uniswap instead of using the staking services at centralized exchanges...there's nothing wrong with using a trezor or a ledger connected to rabby wallet, but be aware of what approvals and revokes do. if you approve a bad smart contract to spend all of your money, you may lose funds. don't go messing around with things like uniswap until you are sure about approvals and revokes. and don't mix up the different networks. mainnet, arbitrum, and optimism are different things. you don't want to end up like others who have sent money on the wrong network by mistake.

I would not suggest DOT either, spending all their money on marketing

I like DOT for the stake rate. Been sideways with a slight uptrend for 2 years with 10+% stake
2
Except CSV doesn't have their name on it. You'll have a problem proving your transactions if you'll get into dispute with IRS
2
Yup THIS!! Along with too high inflation rate… and No One using DOT, it’s just dead…. The whole “interoperability” was just hype word to trick newbs… so many better L2 chains you don’t need “interoperability” when you have ETH L2’s like we have now…
3
Not nearly enough to offset inflation rate being to high..
2
Ofcourse others will bash DOT in an Ethereum sub.  Staking rewards are 17%.  Offset by the inflation rate of 10% the yield becomes 7% total.  ..I’ve been staking for 3 years and using the rewards as supplemental income.

That doesn't make sense honestly (not saying you're wrong - jurisdiction rules differ). If the kleptocratic agency has issues with your report then you have the numbers regardless (pdf or csv). Luckily for me I 'm not a US citizen.

Have fun riding it to ZERO…. No one uses DOT or talks about it, has no use case and Treasury spends all its money on washed up influencers for marketing, which they fail at..

> Luckily for me I 'm not a US citizen...Me neither. ..But in if IRS of my country disputes my income tax filings, then I'll have to prove them with documents from the exchanges. Csv is a lousy proof of anything - it has no names on it, no signature, nothing.

Well damn, there's still people out there cloning Ethereum and reselling it as something new... Amazing.
1
Nothing could be further from the truth. Cartesi began its development in 2018, and it couldn’t be further from cloning Ethereum, as its VM is entirely different from the EVM. Cartesi's alt-VM brings the LINUX OS on-chain, offering developers a completely different programming environment compared to Solidity (and more complex, as developers can code in any of the mainstream programming languages - Python, Rust, C++, JavaScript, etc., leveraging 30 years of Linux progress along with its libraries and popular tooling). Join r/cartesi if you want to understand more before labeling a clone of Ethereum something that is entirely different and designed to complement and scale it, not compete with it.

Buy some eth on a CEX and send it to your wallet so you can use the network

Regular ETH right? I tried sending under my ENS balance and it denied it.

Coinbase will let you, just make sure you withdraw to the same chain you have ENS on as coinbase now supports many L2s as well as mainnet

No no, you misunderstand. I attempted to send less than my ENS balance within cake wallet and it said not enough ETH to make the transaction :/

I think it’s more you who doesn’t understand? ..It doesn’t matter how many tokens you transfer you have to pay ether (ETH) to cover the transaction..If you have no eth in your wallet, only the ENS ERC-20 token you withdrew from a CEX...I’ve never used cake or uphold or have even heard of them tbh

Was that an ERC-20 token transfer?..A normal on-chain ETH transfer would've been even cheaper at $0.07 to $0.14 given that gas price is currently 1-2 Gwei...Edit: Even [an hour ago](https://etherscan.io/blocks?p=15), prices were 1-2 Gwei. And ERC-20 transfers shouldn't cost 100k gas, so you shouldn't have needed to pay as much as $0.80. That's much too high...See https://etherscan.io/gastracker
13
Its because the stupid shit like meme tokens and airdrops moved to rollups

I remember back in the glory days of the crypto boom. $20-$100 gas fees trying to scalp trade the new releases on coinbase… it was a good racket while it lasted.

Haters is still gonna say: too expensive 😂
9
Literally gas has never been lower. It's 1.2 maybe a historical record. Is this due to chain improvements or less people using mainnet?
2
The thing of it is, 80 cents for a transfer is still *insanely* expensive compared to where it needs to be, especially for coin that is made to transact automatically and often. ..But sure, it's a lot better than $50 bucks.

What is safe to use? I don't understand how any L2s are safe to use. I don't understand bridging risks.

Good. So it was an ERC-20 token transfer 2 hours ago at 3.4 Gwei, and you paid 0.0001754 ETH ($0.57)...You originally paid 79,494 gas, but got refunded 35%, and ended up only paying 52,206 gas. These combined explain the difference.
8
Yep. Right when the new token list was released, scramble to a dex to load up and then dump it all into coinbase… straight profit
1
Yes. I transact for 1c per transaction on arbitrum (Ethereum L2) ..Right now a transaction on Ethereum is less than 10 cents...Moving millions or billions worth of ETH for the cost of 10 cents on Mainnet or 1 cent on L2. ..Cheap if you ask me compared to 1-8% fee on other payment services 😅

Title: DEVCon Talks WishList - submit until July 30th
12
I would love to see a talk/event dedicated to the implications of modern AI being able to understand and communicate through natural language. Allowing us to completely restructure the way our community interacts and shares data with each other. Imagine super charging the community with a community AI/blockchain driven social moderator. Have all moderation such as rate limiting data appends based on the number amount of up/downvotes by the community on your data blob contribution for our global AI data aggregator. An Ethereum (LLM) Oracle. Can charge gas to have it generate your answer. And let's make it as cheap as possible of course. Decentralize AI development. Blockchain incentives align up perfectly. Surely I can not be the only one seeing the potential of this? How is it not super obvious to everyone? I know, how arrogant of me to say. I'll continue waiting I guess. And writing from frustration for as long as these ideas continue to face resistance. We have AI able to compete with top level math geniuses. You really think it's not able to understand your code or train of thought? It's not perfect, but thats something to write unit tests for, can have AI have em write for you as well. If I had more time/financial freedom I'd probably start to develop this on my own. All the API's are there already. It's not that hard to setup the first true technodemocracy where all moderation is done by a public algorithm that is programmed through shared consensus. What are we waiting for? What are we still scared about?

Dont tell ppl and in public forums how much crypto you have. Don't react to dm's
5
You will make more ETH if you stake. No one can tell you if that will be profit from the market though. If they could they would be rich. Head on over to r/ethstaker for more info.
3
Solo is pretty expensive primarily due to storage demand. After doing it for 2 years I dropped out. Top 4000 validators at the time. after 2 years about 1800€ of gain, pre tax (single node). Also make sure you understand your tax laws first or you might end up paying more then you gained if staking is considered a special activity that you need permission to do (not kidding).
2
It really depends on how many ETH you have. For the vast majority of people I would advise using Rocket Pool, they have the best reputation as far as liquid staking protocols go. If you don't have enough to (and don't want the responsibility of) running your own node (32 Eth for a full, 8eth for a mini) then it's easiest just to buy RETH (however keep in mind that this might qualify for a taxable event depending on where you are in the world. Staking rewards are just over 2.5% right now. On the other end of the scale if you have a really limited amount of ETH then factor in costs for your gas transactions- sometimes it's not worth it. You should head over to r/ethstaker and ask there too :)
4
Yes
1
If you have 32 ETH or more, look into SSV Network. You create your own keys and use your own withdrawal address. Then you select 4 operators to handle the validation duties for you..https://ssv.network

Alr thanks, corrected it

Well in Germany basically everything has to be Taxed xD.50% of everything,
1
The problem in Germany is less the Tax but the fact that they consider it as business activity so you have to register a business. Check out BMF letter 10.05.2022, "Einzelfragen zur ertragsteuerlichen Behandlung von virtuellen Währungen und von sonstigen Token" where they make the claim that there is a difference between active and passive staking which makes a huge difference from a law perspective given the implications they draw from this...Oh and Tax on capital gains is way less than 50%. Capital gains is for rich people. We do not tax rich people in Germany. Only the poor who have nasty income.
2
How should anyone/the government notice that an ether is mined/stacked. Send it to a exchange and from there to your cold Wallet. Works like a coin mixer
1
At some point you exchange your token to a fiat currency. That is when you have to explain to your bank where the money came from. You might be new to this but I can assure you 'anti money laundering' laws are in place and real in most 1st world countries. Banks have to report to the gov. And god bless your sorry ass if they report something you 'forgot' to report in your tax declaration...Sure there are (illegal) ways around it, but even if you choose them (and therefore openly and proudly commit a crime punished with prison time in many countries) they all have their own challenges. And whatever you do at the end usually you buy yourself something nice with your money. You're one jealous neighbor away from your tax office asking you how you could buy that lambo when you only had an income of 40k last year...Of course this is not an issue when we talk about billions level of money. At that point there are other ways of laundering. But for the typical Redditor that tries to be super smart simply 'not tell the tax office' chances are you'll have some nice time getting gang raped by some guys 2 times taler then you when they send you to prison.

You will never receive an Ethereum-related job if you don't know how to spell Ethereum (not Etherium). So just because of this, yes, it's a scam.

Buying Ethereum to put in a wallet they made for you... so they got the private key and full control of the ETH. You are just giving them money...This scam is one of the oldest in the books.
5
Imagine receiving a call from Microsoft for a job. Then you replied to them, "Thanks, Mikrosoft."..Nope, it won't happen. 🤣

apparently im using their clients funds to buy etherium, not my own personal money...Or is it something along the lines of will it end up somehow being my money because the wallet is “mine”?

If you have to deposit ethereum in a wallet they made, they will steal your ethereum. Its a scam.
3
Okay so basically theyre hiring and using people to be their scam artist right?
-2
No, you would be the one getting scammed, don’t ask me specifics , but the goal is to make you use your money to buy ETH and then have access to it , whether they do it by faking a check from “ the client” or reverse a transaction I don’t know, didn’t try to find out when I got offered a similar “ job”

Grayscale spun off 10% of the AUM of ETHE to create ETH. So ETHE dropped 10% and you were gifted an equivalent amount of ETH.
8
The funds were never designed to match the ETH price, only the price movement. No reason to stay in ETHE other than possible tax implications. Its expense ratio is too high just like with GBTC.
4
Schwab is showing that the ETH I received based on my ETHE balance has a cost basis of $0. So grayscale essentially just screwed people over by bring the cost basis of 10% of their ETHE to $0 which means they will owe more taxes when they sell?
2
I sold ETHE and then got ETH. confused as well lol

isnt it the same? well just to share, i recently bought some eth in coinsxyz

i only know eth hahahaha try trading it from [coins.xyz](http://coins.xyz)

I think they did it in such a way to avoid any taxes, but I am not an expert. Read this:    https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/grayscale-ethereum-trust-announces-taxfree-distribution-93CH-3527410
1
Yeah thats what i was curious about. I never heard anything about me now owning the same amount of shares in ETH as ETHE. I dont know if i sell one if both now go to zero shares? Or if I sell the ETH then im now going short?
1
Its been a few days and it still says i own both with equal shares. I thought it was a glitch but its been a few days
1
Not by design, they are keeping the 2.5% fee likely because a lot of people are not going to sell it just because of capital gains. They want to make sure they are in a long-term bracket and time it appropriately. As things go on I'm sure ETH will be the one that receives funds and ETHE will be the one that bleeds ..The craziest part about this whole thing is how practically no one realized that 10% drop and what it was. I remember threads, people asking, no one had any idea and then we all wake up to these extra shares of ETH

You can see the wallets they hold the ETH in on any blockchain scanner, it’s public information.

So, in skimming the responses and your response to their comments, there is one main thing you are missing.   Ethereum allows YOU to do a lot of the same things with eth as you would fiat. That's the point. But, it is decentralized, and you can have access to it. This is what is unique with crypto.  You control it, you own it, you do what you want with it.
63
Please write "line go up" one more time somewhere in the comments - you've only done this six times so far.
21
There are a plethora of L2 chains where you can use your ETH on hundreds of dapps. Have fun!
29
Stake it and keep it for ever.
8
Exact reason I sold all mine.
4
It depends what you find practical/useful in your life. If you want fiat, sell the ETH for fiat and use that to buy things for yourself...If you want to earn more ETH, stake it...If you want to dabble in trading, then trade it...If you want to explore what Ethereum the network can do, try out some social apps/platforms like lens or farcaster. Finance apps like aave, curve, etc...There are a lot of things you can do with it but the question would be, what do you want to do, or expect to be able to do with it

You can buy a gift card to my restaurant using ETH !!!  Www.ScargoCafe.com. Buy online...We added ETH as a payment method over a year ago but have never promoted it and never had an ETH sale.  You could be our first!  Limit if $500 per day..We’re located on Beautiful Cape Cod Massachusetts and we’re one of the area’s most popular year round restaurants.  Come see us!!!

I bridged mine to Axelar to take a stablecoin loan. Pooled that to earn interest to pay the loan off in Osmosis. NFA, just what I did.

defi!..look into aave, curve, and some other big bluechips first.
4
Sell your eth when it goes to 8k each.Use 50% of the funds on yourself.50% keep liquid for reinvestment in about 12 months after that.
2
"Line goes up"... Call it investing or holding. Line goes up is not such a cool thing to say as you might think.

Go to uniswap and get Kendu Inu on ETH chain. There is a dApp launching called kenduchads.com where you will EARN eth based on a 5M kendu bag minimum to participate . You have 6 days before launch. Do some research on the main website and join the TG. GL.
2
Hypothetically - anything..In actuality- nothing really..Smart contracts, etc, aren’t really there yet

Swap a little bit for $Kendu. You have 7 days to get 5 mil $Kendu and be set for Kendu Chads.

You can actually use it to buy gift cards. You can check piggy cards.

Pretty slick you have access to a bank account with Fiat that apparently isn't getting sucked away by inflation.can you easily send money to family, friends, or for business to anyone in the world in a couple seconds/minutes 24/7? That could be useful, otherwise It sounds like you can do everything you want to do just fine with your normal money. Why are you buying crypto?
1
Spread it across 3 projects maybe. Oracle, RWA and AI. I would say you look into ONDO, supraOracles and FET.
1
You could look at grabbing an nft. I own a few and my guess with this next cycle, we will see some blow up. Gives you  different set of exposure while still maintaining(assuming the nft doesn’t crumble) your ETH
1
You can easily go into the store and buy gum with ETH, however you can use it to power web3 Dapps or simply stake the ETH and earn a return on it

1
You can hold it
1
its a store of value/investment bro same with a block of gold you dont have to watch number go up its about your fiat purchasing power going down. why hold fiat when every year its purchasing power is less and less when you can hold btc/eth and your purchasing power goes up. plus you cant get screwed by a bank (for whatever reason they like) when you are your own bank.
1
ETH is the currency for using the Ethereum network. So, you can do anything available on the network. You could convert currency, take out a loan, lend currency, play games, gamble, launch a token, etc...Imagine buying oil and wondering what you can do with it. That's ETH. But if you don't have anything that needs oil, the only reason to have oil is to one day sell it to someone else who needs it, if your needs change in the future, or if more use cases become available in the future. ..As always, do not buy what you do not understand. Don't be the guy in 1998 without a computer or a pet buying stock in pets.com.

I don’t know what can you actually do with three grand? That might be 800 or 5000.

You can hold it until 2033 and hope the supply remains stable. By then the M2 money supply will go from the current 21 trillion to 33 trillion. ..M2 grew 10x over the last 40 years. Will double again in 10 more. Trillions more USD units to come. Plus trillions of other units managed by governments...Then that 2 ETH will have done what you hope. Carries value to yourself into the future.

1
Ok here are a couple of real world reasons why eth the asset is valuable...- stablecoins that run on the eth network need eth when you transfer them. Stablecoins are great for cross border payments, and save a lot of money for remittance . Take a look at rwa.xyz..- decentralised finance. Apps like uniswap whilst currently are used for swapping order cryptocurrencies are very efficient ways of creating markets. They will rival the nasdaq and other exchanges in the future. Eth is used to  pay for gas on these apps. Why? Because it’s so much more efficient to have a tokenised version of an asset (bond, equity etc) on the same ledger as the money (stablecoin). You can get atomic settlement instead of 2 day clearing with multiple middlemen...There are many more use cases that will get disrupted as more commerce comes on chain, such as gaming, gambling and identity. But the above two are already taking off. Might not be useful to you just yet, but it already is for millions of people doing global remittance..-
1
Not much, whatever it is you do you’ll pay a lot of gas for. Just swap it for BTC and chill

Did you consider staking your ETH? Imo, if you plan to hold them for the long term, the best way is to put money to work for you. I just have a small amount left for gas and most of my bag is staked in Rocket Pool. I have one part of the bag allocated in DripFI so I can get benefits such as Airdrops and whitelisting spots for some other projects such as KSU, AUK, BTP...
0
Convert 1 ETH to USDT or USDC, so you have half ETH half fiat. Start following [this trading bot I invented](https://www.twitch.tv/ethaitrader), but divide the trading volume by 200, so when it buys 2 ETH, you buy 0.01 ETH. Follow it religiously, your 2 ETH will become 3 ETH after a year, 5 ETH after 2 years, and so on.

Fine. Line go down.
1
I’m looking for uses beyond line goes up. Like, dApps that are useful or practical like say, there are useful apps on Web2.0 that are useful and practical that I use everyday. What would using ETH everyday actually look like and is it even worth the $6k?
-1
stake where?
1
Not really interested in line go up and earning more. ..I’m interested in the other applications you mention, like using for its intended purpose. I assume this tech wasn’t built to simply watch a line go up and just build apps to earn for ETH and watch line go up more. ..However why would I pay fees to use a social network, which presumably has like 1% or less of the users of any traditional social platform?
-3
I don’t understand all that mumbo jumbo. Like why? I want to use it, not simply watch line go up.
-16
I know but why defi when I can safely earn about 5% with my fiat, and I don’t have to worry about my fiat dropping 40% in a year. It’s also a lot simpler and FTIC insured. Again just taking the eth use case and comparing it to my existent options with the same capital.
-11
Lol I wanted to the say the same thing. Been in Kendu for 2 months now and wasnt ever disappointed. Im not gonna say he will 100x his ETH from here but a 2x is imo a super safe bet on Kendu and that's as conservative as I can get

I got so many comments about buying gift cards, rofl. I might as well sell if so many people recommend this as an actual use case of this amazing revolutionary technology. I was honestly hoping after 8 years of innovation that I’d be able to use smart contracts in an interesting way or SOMETHING. Kind of sad tbh. ETH seems to have just morphed into an “investment” or “store of value” like BTC. That’s the narrative I’m picking up here, and I understand it, but that’s not the answer I was looking for.

I don’t want to purchase gift cards, rofl. Alarming how many comments seriously suggested this. If this is where the tech is 8 years on, count me a skeptic lol.
1
I already did that. Used to have 22 eth. Now I have two. I already know how to play the game of the greater fool; I’m interested in other applications.
1
Is using it to do things wasting it? I don’t get this comment

wtf is a kaspa

What are you on about? Dapp development has been on fire for years now, leading innovation in the space. Ethereum is doing ~300 tps and basically free to use on L2s because transactions cost fractions of pennies. The L1 fees barely get above 10 gwei now, compared to the sustained 200-300 gwei that we had during the last bull run...Ethereum is fast, cheap, decentralised, secure, and a relatively huge amount of dapps.

Um no, bitrefill, travelswap.xyz

Zoom out. What's happened with eth vs fiat over the last 5 years. Will it continue going up over the next 5, idk. But that's part of why we are here...If you want more control of your money with less volatility, go usdc and carry it in your own wallet.
1
He's basically just here to try and convince Ethereans that Ethereum is uselss...This guy claims he has 2 ETH. He also claims he's not interested in line go up, so he clearly doesn't treat this as an invesment. And he also has no idea what ETH is for, so he didn't buy it to use. ..So are we suppose to believe he blew half a grand on something without intending to make money on it, and without knowing what it's for? All with the full knowledge that it might go down 40% at any time, like he keeps emphasising? He's clearly full of crap, or he hates money and wants to lose it...He either lied about owning ETH, or he bought the top, is now underwater, and is angry about it and pretending he doesn't care about line go up.
11
Oh right. Like spend it buying gift cards to spend on the convenience store?
1
There are many options. ..if you don't know much and want a super easy way and don't care if an organisation does it for you, then use coinbase or any exchange that offers staking services. ..If you're keen to stick with the ethos of Ethereum and be decentralised, trustless, and hold your own assets, then swap to rETH and stake that way. ..In the not so distant future you'll be able to run a rocketpool node with only 2 ETH butcurrently that's not possible. 8 ETH minimum at the moment...If you're really keen to get into the nitty gritty and run your own hardware then check out things like Obol, for DVT (distributed valitator technology)..I leave out solo staking as an option because you state less than 32 ETH
2
If you are not interested in line go up, then you don't need 2 ETH, unless you own an organisation that relies on Ethereum blockchain to run. Yes, such organisations exist. The Singapore government, for example, authenticates education certifications using Ethereum. It's a quick and easy way for any employer in any corner of the Earth to spot forgeries in a split second without having to order a background check...Ethereum is like a decentralised database. If you have no use for a database for your day to day activities, then you don't need that much ETH. In the future, you may be required to hold a bit to interact with organisations and merchants who use Ethereum or it's L2s, but that's probably a decade or two away, and there's no chance you'd be required to hold 2 ETH worth.
10
Market builds apps and stuff to fulfill the wants and needs of its immediate customers. That is how the free market works in any industry. ..Unfortunately, the vast majority participate in crypto for the line go up game. So devs mainly build things to assist users to play this line go up game. You will be hard pressed to find an app using ETH that isn’t about helping you to buy/get more ETH or sell more ETH for fiat. Smart ones are dressed up in fancy narratives like play to earn, social, etc. ..Any project deviating from helping user to make money eventually meet the Darwinian outcome. They go broke and leave the market, because no user wants them or fund them.
1
It's intended purpose is an investment you clown, ..You buy, you hold, you invest, wtf is so hard to understand about that
1
It's not meant to make sense.
4
They borrowed against an asset to purchase real world things. I mostly use DEFI in this way. I have something valuable “ETH” and can use it to borrow to pay for things now vs. selling my ETH. That is in every sense of the phrase “using it”.
4
it also went up 95% year to year, but lets not talk about that
15
You may get 5% on fiat but when the inflation is 5%+ you actually end up with less value. I know inflation has got better but IMO any return you can get with fiat is so significantly inflated away it ends up negligible...But eth is near 0 inflation / deflationary. And you can easily get 5% return. Maths speak for themselves
4
But every time someone tells you something unique you can do with ETH that you can't do with fiat (e.g. L2, stake, lend, etc) you say I'm too afraid to do that so this is what you end up with.
4
Crypto is meant to be a decentralized currency. Is it not performing it's function?
1
You missed the stfu part.
0
Depends on what you are using it for. If you use it to buy things you could buy with fiat then yes it's wasting it. If it's investing it in a way to increase your stack, then it's not wasting it...But be careful with the DeFI stuff.. I guy I know lost 700 ether risking his assets.
1
I hear you. So like what dApps are actually useful that doesn’t have a non-crypto corollary that I could easily use for free like a social platform and isn’t just an app to accumulate more crypto in the hopes line go up?
2
Stop spitting facts. People like to do no research and spew off what they hear others say instead
1
Adoption of ethereum as a currency is still not widespread in the US or any country for that matter . .Ethereum still hasn’t got its “paypal” moment . .300 tps is very low if the system has to scale globally. .Yes L2’s are awesome and the infrastructure is improving . I was hoping it will accelerate much quicker . .I am a big believer that some public blockchain will be the future of banking and a marketplace of goods globally but ethereum is as of today far away from it .

I was gonna suggest hookers and blow, but heroin and deep web gambling is also good.

My thoughts as well, but better explained. Lol.
4
Not at all. I can do that with fiat. Why would I go through another step to achieve the same goal?
1
Thanks for your advice! I've held onto eth for ages but really really should have staked more. Are there any other guides or "staking for dummies" you may have? ..Where, how much, timelines, tips, etc...
1
Thanks for the informative and honest response...What exactly is the purpose of selling eth on the open market then for individuals to hold?
1
That’s not the narrative 8 years ago. What’s changed? What are you “investing” in? You don’t own a portion of any company or a stake in ethereum itself. You’re simply holding a digital asset hoping to sell to someone at a higher price later. There’s no underlying asset or cash flow.
1
I mean, sure, very confusingly. This seems like the most common response from people, but feels completely out of step with the original intent of why eth was created. Maybe I am completed out of touch here though.
0
Classic "picking up dimes in front the steam roller" there...Maybe you can get 5%. But there's a chance of a 40% drop too.
4
Ya I guess I was thinking more games or other non-defi apps built on it. I knew those were more popular 4-8 years ago. Seems eth is now just clever ways to make more eth in the hopes line goes up and then you sell for fiat. Little disappointed tbh.
-6
As just a regular dude, why would I spend ether, whose price is volatile, to buy gift cards, or anything else? My post is trying to understand what things can I do that I can’t necessarily do with fiat. Everyone just mentions things I can easily do with fiat - get 2-5% interest, buy things, lend it, etc. Not a single person has mentioned an interesting or practical use case for smart contracts, which were my initial interest 8 years. If you’re telling me ether is just now another cryptocurrency, then I’m not sure it’s price is justified by anything other than a game of the greater fool. I can use ALGO or some of my other coins to accomplish the very same tasks. So why would I use ether?
1
How does the price ever go up if we all stfu.

Ethereum isn't built to be a real world currency so maybe that's where your negative outlook stems from. It's going to be a very long time, if ever, if that's what you're waiting on

The other reply helped me to understand what you were asking. I previously thought you were asking why an individual would sell ETH...If the question is why the ETH foundation sold ETH to individuals, if individuals have very little use for it, then the answer is:..Ethereum needs to be decentralised to work. That means it needs as many people to hold it as possible. Every additional person holding it and staking it, provides an additional layer of security to Ethereum. Otherwise, it's no different from a regular centrally controlled database and there's no point to the entire technology. Might as well use Amazon AWS...In essence, the individuals who hold and stake it help to secure the network. They, in term, get rewarded with fees and block rewards, though they have to take on immense capital risks to do so, so this is only for true believers.
6
>What exactly is the purpose of selling eth on the open market then for individuals to hold?..I didn't understand the question. The purpose of selling eth on the open market is to get fiat because our economy still runs on fiat and almost nobody takes ETH as payment.
3
It is part of the ethos of making a fully decentralized and transparent ledger system to  make the gas available equally to anyone who may want it.
3
You’re investing in the network when you hold ETH. Companies that build raise money in ETH. The more ETH is worth the more funding they have as .an example.
1
It's an asset... just like stocks... you hold it and it grows and you invest ..You should not be in crypto 🤣🤣🤣
1
Well hold on... these tactics of borrowing against your assests were things only the weathlthy was able to do in traditional markets with some having high limits before you can get started. You now have access to similar products with only a handful of eth. Some of this is alien to average folks (the nonwealthy) because we wete never shown or taught it. So take these nuggets of information, research and look deeper. These dudes trying to put you on.
2
It was important first for ETH to have value for decentralization and security purposes. That’s a big topic all on it’s own but it laid the foundation for what we have today. It’s my bet that we see growth into other utilities that could benefit from a borderless decentralized approach that aren’t purely financial. Digital ownership and tokenization is one speculative example that may play out eventually. ..Social networking may indeed grow as it isn’t entirely necessary to have a centralized entity own/ control user accounts, data, etc. ..Truthfully we will have to wait and see. Invest in the building of the network by holding and creating value if it’s something you believe is worthwhile.
1
No, you can get a real return of 5% and have the option of gaining additional value over time, despite the volatility. .If history is a guide, you made more APY after inflation over 3-10 years with ETH than with any fiat.
2
The only disappointing thing in this post is your lack of understanding of ETH coupled with unwillingness to learn.
5
Are you trolling? Mr Troll. Or just don't know much about all this? 🧌🧌🧌
1
Because if you buy the gift cards with the ether, you don't pay taxes on the gains? That's a very, very real benefit to a "regular dude" ..Your post was about what to do with ethereum. It had absolutely nothing to do with smart contracts. If you wanted answers related to that, you should have specified. ..I'm not going to sit here and explain the ethereum blockchain to you. Honestly, it seems to me that you lack the capability of understanding. It would be a legitimate waste of anyone's time to sit here and explain it to you.

Thats the hope, the entire world should view eth or some other coin as a viable alternative to making transactions just like they see a cheque as an instrument today ...Putting that aside , we need dapps with real world applications working on a large scale as a medium term goal . Like a real estate dapp where you can list, buy or sell property  OR an amazon on ethereum  (or some public blockchain)

> it's no different from a regular centrally controlled database and there's no point to the entire technology. Might as well use Amazon AWS...You got at least one thing right

It doesn’t matter that „no one“ is using ETH as a payment substitute, as you can have a debit card filled with ETH and use it in any Visa accepting store for normal purchases.
1
You don’t even know what you’re writing. You’re not even worth arguing with considering how little you understand about the difference between a digital asset like ETH or BTC and a stock. You think number go up is investing. 🤣🤣🤣
1
Historically, that may be true. But the whole scheme relies on new users coming in to provide those gains...We had a once-in-a-lifetime situation when it was all new and exciting, people were bored at home and (in the US) they had stimulus cheques to spend...We won't see those days again. In fact, people are skeptical and jaded.
0
I just remember 4-8 years ago using it for interesting things like Gods Unchained or Zed Run. No one has mentioned a single interesting dApp outside of defi and staking. Now it seems like the consensus in this thread is that ETH is just a mechanism to accumulate more ETH at which point you just dump your bags on the next hodler when you reach your price point. Just seems like the entire vibe has changed. Now it’s just stake your eth durr durr and hope line goes up in the future. I’m legitimately interested in other use cases that could have a practical effect on my life, and if no one can point me in that direction, I may as well dump it now.
-1
I really don’t. I’ve been holding for 8 years, and have never really done a deep dive into the ecosystem since then, so just curious 8 years on what can I actually do with it that I couldn’t back then. 90% of the responses here at telling me to stake and use dApps that make me earn more ETH, but surely after 8 years something more exciting as happened that I can use in my everyday life that isn’t “buy gift cards” or “stake”, two things that I can do easier with fiat. Not trolling.
1
I don’t pay taxes when I spend fiat either and I don’t need a separate wallet and go through all the intermediary steps to simply buy a gift card to Walmart. ..Well that’s a huge problem if the average person needs a lecture on the entire technology to actually understand what the hell it is for, and even then, they could be told to buy gift cards. Thanks for the response though.
1
Durrrrr
0
I partly agree on stimulus checks and that. ..But I‘d say the once in a lifetime opportunity is just starting now: ..We have the ETF since yesterday, which makes it easy to buy for the mainstream. ..Populistic governments are increasing around the world, making more people think how to rescue their wealth when public debt is skyrocketing in many countries. Some will think, fiat is not the safest option and diversify. ..Only 1-5% of people are invested in crypto at all, but more are learning about it.
1
Gods Unchained is still around so now you're complaining because now there are more options? New defi games you can play to grow your eth (instead of spending eth on Gods Unchained). The problem isn't ETH.
1
Alright bro well you're obviously hell bent on refuting anything anyone says. ..Have a good day. /s
1
Are the ETH original dev team happy that big Wall St companies are muscling in, providing security and usability that ETH lacks, and taking a sizeable clip?..(Pretty sure Satoshi is spinning in his grave, but we'll never know for sure.)
1
I’m really not. I’m trying to understand with a very simple example that a lot of people have mentioned. Gift cards. Like WTF? Lol. If this is where the tech is 8 years on they people legitimately think of mentioning it as a use case, I’m out and handing my bags to the next fool when and if the price gets to 6-8k.
1
The only reason people are recommending gift cards is because you said you're too scared to use dapps on the blockchain. ..Are you actually retarded?

No. Are you? Where did I say I was “scared”? Why are you so toxic?

Isn't it $590M in, $484 out. +$106.8M net
2
What fund are people rolling with?..Been a long time holder of GBTC and ETHE until this year. When BTC ETFs came out, I moved my GBTC to fidelity’s FBTC, and am now going to do the same with my ETHE/ETH moving it to Fidelity’s FETH...What benefits do people see with other funds like ishares or bitwise over fidelity?
2
Excuse me? How much?
1
Not looking good at all.
1
Lower but not low enough
1
Yes roughly (outflow in red, inflows in green)
1
Why did you initially switch from Grayscale to Fidelity? Lower fees? BlackRocks ishares is nice
1
$106M
4
how low do you think its going today?
4
Their wasn’t much media attention on them
1
At this point ive sold everything Grayscale and have moved 100% to fidelity..Fidelity has self custody, rather than relying on coinbase, and has lower fees in general. Overall fees comparable to other new ETFs..Grayscale should have reacted much faster to the changing landscape of ETFs, their outflows have been substantial
2
I don't know. If they grayscale selling follows the same pattern as it did with bitcoin it can go pretty low the next few weeks I guess.

I agree, i think Fidelity is doing it right and Grayscale dropped the ball at the most important time

Many things cause the price to go up and down, traders closing positions, people selling Ethereum on the news, global events, etc Not sure why it didn’t jump up either

Interesting
2
this has ~25% of the btc etf volume. Extrapolating dates according to such etf, is dumb
1
If both grayscale then possibly, ones mini ones regular with higher fees. Their hoping people withdraw from the main to mini

That would be pretty sweet, why by Christmas tho?

Yesssssssssssssssssss 😈

soooooooooo.....????

Depends on how buying goes and many other things. But when people but the ETH ETFs the price should go up since they have to buy on market
2
For this news? About two months ago

👀👀👀
1
less media coverage than the BTC ETF, so may take longer
1
Do they buy Eth the same day or do they settle the next day or some other schedule? If the price just followed the spot price and they settled Eth purchases later, it seems like there would be a delay of at least a day wrt impact on spot price.
2
Putting a specific date on it is extremely difficult but gotta have a range of something

I see, I don't remember seeing this with btc, It shows I own both and the same qty of both ( I owned original grayscale eth)

Because Christmas
3
It depends, if they have "left over" ETH they'll create a new share with that, that may buy later that day of demand is higher than the ETH they have, or they can buy during the day right away
1
so date prediction changes

If you owned the grayscale before yesterday, it was probably the ETF converting
2
Lmao Fair enough
1
got it, any news on how staking will be handled with eth etf ?

SEC hasn't approved it yet, but if they do and companies decide stake or create new funds that stake, I imagine they'd pay it out like some sort of dividend or payment. Check out the substack page for more

ETHE is a spot ETF now. It just is keeping its higher fees. Keep in mind long term capital gains. If you have holdings that you have held for a significant period of time you could be screwing yourself. If you are going to sell anyway why would you wait a few days? So you just want to pay the higher fees for a few extra days?
4
I’m going to wait a few days. Gonna look for a slow day to convert.
3
depending on your capital gain tax situation I would just rip the bandaid off sooner than later.
2
It's in my 401k so taxes aren't an issue. I'm just afraid of getting caught in a premium discount situation as ETHE outflows will be very large initially.
6
Does ethe get stake revenue?  The new spot ETFs do not.  So that could be a reason.
2
Prices are good. I just converted.
7
No, it was one of the required changes by the SEC, that the ETF's couldn't offer staking rewards as dividends.  :-(
2
Well now that high fee looks really unreasonable...  What exactly is better about an ETF compared to a cef?  They just don't want to be otc?
1
Grayscale just kept the fee high because they know a certain number of investors will either be lazy and not transfer OR they bought so low that there would be huge tax implications so they are stuck paying the high fee. They did the same for BTC. Kind of gouging tbh, but they are just doing what’s in their best interest.

We chose to release it on July 22nd, marking the 10th anniversary, to give our community another reason to celebrate, be happy, and feel proud of how far we've come. ..We appreciate your kind words and acknowledgment of the effort that went into creating this video...[~https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1815316383233925498~](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1815316383233925498)..[~https://x.com/preston\_vanloon/status/1815351701299232883~](https://x.com/preston_vanloon/status/1815351701299232883)..[~https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1815322655295148198~](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1815322655295148198)

Sure. Peer to peer transactions on the internet. I can't do that with fiat.

Thank you for your perspective. While we recognize that the Ethereum blockchain's launch date is indeed July 30, 2015, and commonly celebrated as Ethereum's Birthday, this video marks a significant milestone by commemorating the contributions and growth of the Ethereum community over the past decade. ..Different milestones hold significance for various members of our community. Some may celebrate December 1, 2020, as the start of the new Ethereum (PoS), while others see September 15, 2022, as a key date. Each perspective offers us unique reasons to be happy and celebrate our journey. I'd love to invite you to join us in this moment of happiness and reflection...The anniversary celebration to give our community an additional moment of reflection and pride in our collective achievements.

crypto is not P2P... in fact the two peers who transfer crypto never communicate with each other - instead they go through a myriad of third parties maintaining the blockchain..Also the idea that crypto allows you to send value instantly is false.  I prove that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4118s).
0
I watched the bit you linked to and there was almost nothing about peer to peer transactions. It was about crypto being slower and more expensive than traditional payment mechanisms and how users have to convert back to fiat to settle transactions.
1
That segment debunks the claim that crypto is an easy way to send money from peer-to-peer...The fact that bitcoin is not P2P is another separate issue.  I explained why that was false - did you not see what I wrote?  I'll copy it below:..>crypto is not P2P... in fact the two peers who transfer crypto never communicate with each other - instead they go through a myriad of third parties maintaining the blockchain..With bitcoin, you have 2 peers who never interact.  Instead they interact with third-party nodes running the blockchain who change the centralized database that is the blockchain, then the two peers check the blockchain to see what's changed.  It's not actually peer TO peer.  It's peer-to-middleman and other-peer-to-middleman.  That's how it works.  It doesn't fit the traditional definition of peer-to-peer in any meaningful way...This is yet another example of  how crypto bros make up their own definition of words that have other meanings in the real world.  P2P has a specific meaning - peers talk to each other.  This does NOT happen with Bitcoin.  Comprende?..If you don't understand that, then you don't understand crypto & blockchain and we can't have an intelligent discussion...If you disagree that it isn't P2P, explain to me how 2 peers communicate with *each other* (and no middlemen) during a bitcoin transaction?  That's not the way it works and I challenge you to demonstrate otherwise.
1
Your statement is inconsistent with my experience. If I run a node and send crypto from my personal wallet to someone else’s personal wallet, who is the middleman specifically? Because I’ve done that many times for years and I’ve never interacted with any middleman. Additionally, crypto is a much easier way to transact in ways that the banking system considers illegitimate, risky, or gray area. I’ve had my debit card declined by the issuing banks many times, but I’ve never had a crypto transaction declined, with successful recurring transactions over a period of more than half a decade.
1
> Your statement is inconsistent with my experience...This is called, "anecdotal evidence" and is not in any way factual or scientific...>If I run a node and send crypto from my personal wallet to someone else’s personal wallet, who is the middleman specifically? ..This "someone else" NEVER CONTACTS YOU DIRECTLY.  ..What part of that can you not comprehend?..Peer-to-peer means just that: two systems TALKING TO EACH OTHER...That does not happen in this instance...Do you need me to draw this in crayons?

Are you all saying once Eth starts to trade on the stock exchange the going rate will be the same $$ as any other exchange $$?  .If so why do so many think the stock market will help drive the price?  Is it just because it’s on the stock exchange?
5
Good news
2
Speaking only for myself here.  I’m retired with Roth’s, IRA and other investments in my portfolio.  The last thing I would do would be to liquidate any of those to buy crypto.  .That said while I still worked and had surplus funds I got into the crypto world. ..I just find watching all this play out to be interesting.
2
Tons of people do not have set up a crypto wallet and do not want to set one up. Also, lots of people have retirement accounts with money to invest.  All of these people buying will create demand for Ethereum.
4
It will go up because some people have a lot of money in places like their Roth IRA & want exposure to crypto in their stock portfolio.

the increased demand for the finite Ethereum token should drive up the price when compared to fiat dollars.

I’m not saying this to be mean, but I think you have a long way to go before starting to write your own PoS UTXO consensus algo as a HS student who has just started programming.
5
This being r/ethereum I'd question whether you need your own PoS implementation and whether you couldn't rely on blobs and Ethereum's PoS implementation to secure your utxo chain.
3
Hey OP. Genuinely curious here. Why UTXO?
1
How many years of proposals, discussions and rewrites it took for Ethereum to go PoS?
0
i just wanted to learn, since both account and utxo are viable ones, is there something wrong with utxo model which i may not know?
1
Many, but important differences are that it went from pow (to first get a good distribution) to pos, it doesn't utilitize utxo and that pos was barely explored at the time.
1
It's not readily compatible with smart contracts. You would need eUTXO which will have a conversion layer and it will always be slower than addressing scheme that supports smart contracts natively. This is where Patricia/Merkle tree shines. That's what Ethereum uses and is readily upgradeable to have quantum resistance (look up: "Lamport signatures") should it ever be required in the near future.

Ye thanks, ive already got root hash of transaction with merkle tree implementation for extra validation, just trynna find a ways to make a pos cons, figuring things out

Saito is a proven scam

The problem is relates to congestion pricing, fee-burns, auctions for blockspace or mechanisms to allocate fees to different parties. The impossibility proofs that are getting written are mostly supporting specific trade-offs here ("given that X is impossible..."). Examples:..[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151)  .  .and this..[https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321)..If you have both pareto-optimality and incentive compatibility then collusion is always suboptimal as no subset of participants have byzantine strategies available that makes them better off. So on the most abstract level, any solution implies a highly-efficient and more scalable design generally, since no-one has a viable strategy to pull money away from where it is supposed to go.

Check out University of Nicosia courses. I think there are some free ones plus degree courses https://www.unic.ac.cy/iff/education-and-training/ .. if you put it out there you’re looking for ‘experts’ you’re going to attract scammers in with the genuine people and not know enough to tell the difference. Unfortunately that’s the nature of the space, which is its strength as well as its weakness in terms of mass adoption

Here:..NFTs were a hype cycle that never had any utility in the realm of "pictures". Utility in NFTs is really based around features you won't even know you're using NFTs, like Uniswap V3...Crypto: Learn about finance first. Understand how the stock market works, then make your way into defi. Defi is the same but much more complex since you see the code but nothing is backed by insurance like banks have...  .You can use things like investopedia for finance and economics. For defi, learn about protocols through defillama. First and foremost, don't fall victim to dunning kruger effect and think you're an expert after a few months. ..Before using an defi protocol, read the documentation over and over again researching the terms until you really understand it. Don't be one of those people who borrow from Aave then say "How does the APR work, why is it lower than last month?"
2
My first reaction is to tell you not to pay to learn about it. Google, YouTube, etc...But, what are you trying to learn? The coding? The art? How to build a website for NFTs? Or are you looking into the value aspect? Buy and sell? Or perhaps you are interested in the proof of ownership concept?
1
Anyone offering to help you if you pay them with no verifiable proof they are a so called expert is a red flag. The first thing you learn in the crypto space is that there are scammers everywhere, and it is hard to trust anyone. I learned the hard way years ago. I lost, gained, got scammed, and prospered at times. Those experiences were invaluable “tuition” in the crypto game. I am far from an expert, but just a regular guy/dad/husband/friend who helped my close friend & family get into crypto without having to learn  the hard painful lessons and experiences that I had to learn the hard way, back when I had nobody to ask that I could trust. I am far from an expert, but I’ve been around long enough that I can steer you in the direction of where to look, and what not to do so you are not scammed. Either way, good luck!

Title is misleading. It should be going “beyond pro-crypto politicians”..TL;DR we must fund and support pro-free speech politicians.
2
Maybe it's overly cynical, but I'm not sure I have much hope for political coalition building that is mainly founded on values. Consider that the anger over early 2000s copyright stuff did not really, as far as I know, produce legislative wins. Pirates don't have money, and you can't make a lot of money from digital piracy. Cryptocurrency on the other hand, there is a lot of money in it. There are big companies with a vested interest in legislative outcomes, and there are many individuals who have bags they want to go up and want to back someone who supports their financial interests. I think that's why successes have been achieved and why there are politicians willing to give crypto the time of day...I do want to stand with the underlying goals of freedom and decentralization over just freedom to trade tokens, and I want those goals to be politically popular, and not end up abandoned as soon as convenient. Not sure how we get there though.

consider using one of the Ethereum Layer 2s. They are way cheaper.
27
Ethereum is where its at. Best to use a L2 like base
6
Yes. Between the gas efficiency of the layer 2s and the documentation available, ETH is the best
4
Polygon is good because it will soon be connected to the AggLayer which will provide your dapp with deep liquidity 
3
after krc-20 is well established no

Polygon is sure good, but chia is probably furthest now.

yes it is. But you need to create it in ethereum and bridge then to the layer you want to operate on to simplify bridging for the users

Thanks! That saved me a bunch of googling. Any opinions about Polygon?

Here's some data sites that will help you understand the different L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem:..* https://l2fees.info/..* https://growthepie.xyz/..* https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk..* https://rollup.wtf/..* https://www.orbiter.finance/dataDetail?nav=Rollups
17
Polygon, Base, and Arbitrum are all good.
4
While there's nothing wrong with Polygon, it's only a side-chain compared to an L2 (which directly inherits Ethereum's security)...Fees are actually lower on most L2's, so you're better off using either Optimism, Arbitrum, or Base instead of Polygon anyway.
5
I recently sent 1.5k Polygon from MetaMask to Coinbase, and it costed me about 6 cents. Also, I think the fact that the software is "EVM Compatible" , yet faster than Ethereum is pretty impressive. I was reading that it's currently the most used coin. Also, just fyi, there is a Visa card coming out later this year which uses Polygon USDT as its base. A company named Tangem, I believe is releasing the card. So anyways, lots of reasons to be optimistic about Polygon, imo

so easy to hack crypto which is supposed to be hard to hack. am I missing something
1
Its arguably impossible to hack crypto and if it ever was it would just be treated like a software bug. The chain would be forked to exclude the fraudulent transactions, fixing the bug and allowing the network to sync and agree on the fork. This has happened before...What can be hacked is other peoples centralized assets like computers, network traffic, local wallets, etc...To avoid any losses, don't keep your crypto in wallets you do not control the keys of.
3
When has that happened before?

[Btc overflow bug](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident) or the ETC/ETH hard fork due to the DAO (although this wasn’t really a protocol level bug, but a smart contract that held so much ether it posed a protocol risk to PoS)

ETH layer 2s. Ease of development and low cost. But the toughest part is getting the data. Especially if you're gonna have betting lines. I've started a similar project and I can tell you the least difficult part are the smart contracts and eth interfacing. The tough part is writing web scrapers and sourcing data near real-time. You don't need to push it directly to the blockchain, but your gonna run in to trouble with keeping your data up to date.

It's simple: Polygon. Look at Polymarket and its success on the chain.

Good questions/feedback! Thank you. Here are some of the current approaches (the app is in dev testing):..- No registration, only need to connect wallet  .- All contest details/entries/picks submitted to smart contract  .- Contract will be locked once games start  .- Scores/winners calculated off chain (this can be processed on chain, but gas price concern) - Location restrictions to align with legality  .- Data: paid/licensed APIs..Here's a current test contract on Sepolia - [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x50cb189683fc1417ee04b0d371a3471ede8f7e67](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x50cb189683fc1417ee04b0d371a3471ede8f7e67)

This is great feedback, thank you! Your def right, the jobs to keep the data real-time and normatilized from sport to sport is challenging. I am using a licensed API, which has made it more straight forward. I have MLB working well, and plan to add NFL soon...As soon as I choose a network...I will send the dev link to try it out :)

Title: "Connect a wallet" without giving private key?
1
WARNING ABOUT SCAMS: Recently there have been a lot of convincing-looking scams posted on crypto-related reddits including fake NFTs, fake credit cards, fake exchanges, fake mixing services, fake airdrops, fake MEV bots, fake ENS sites and scam sites claiming to help you revoke approvals to prevent fake hacks. These are typically upvoted by bots and seen before moderators can remove them. Do not click on these links and always be wary of anything that tries to rush you into sending money or approving contracts....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wallets need to sign transactions. In order to sign transactions a private key is required. With metamask you can link it with a hardware wallet like ledger, and approve transactions with the device. Otherwise, if you need to sign, you will need to create a new key or add your key to metamask. One more option is to use your phone (if you have a wallet on it with your key) and connect via QR code.
3
You can generate a public key (address) from your private key. And share it with service. It could be enough to receive...If you need to sign a message (prove the ownership of the address) or use a non custodial wallet, you will have to import your private key. I guess a non custodial wallet like a Trust wallet is a safe choice.
1
Just create a new wallet using MetaMask. It's no big deal to have a second wallet for airdrops. With airdrops, be care of token approval scams.
1
Do they need to sign transactions even if it's only for _receiving_ tokens?
2
But the service has some kind of UI that only allows selecting a predetermined "wallets" all of which are product names, there's no UI whatsoever to give just a public key. And those wallets you can connect are browser plugins and phone apps it seems. I don't want to give the private key to either. ..While I didn't try all of them by far, I tried MetaMask that looks like the most popular one, and that one does not seem to support giving only a public key. Or is MetaMask so thrustworthy that it's no problem there?
1
It depends. If it’s a “claim” of sorts, then yes. If some other actor is initiating the transfer, then no. Many dapps will want a user to sign a message with the private key to prove ownership etc. So the connect wallet flow you are seeing is part of that. ..Keep in mind many airdrop sites are scams and may ask you to sign something you shouldn’t, like a token approval. Be safe. Your paranoid stance is a good thing.
1
No.  Just your public key (AKA receive address) is required to receive tokens.
1
MM is somewhat OK. The problem with MM is that you store your private key on the machine. I would add, claim, and delete if I was concerned with using MM...If you can't give your private key at all costs, you can write the software yourself. It will require reverse engineering of the website.
1
Then why is MetaMask's UI asking me for a private key (or generate private key), and provides no UI whatsoever to make me enter only an existing public key of a wallet I already created offline?
1
You say you only want to keep a paper wallet but you want to use MetaMask? You can't have your cake and eat it too.  The whole point of a wallet is to store and manage keys so you can interact with blockchains and smart contracts.  .  .If you want to receive the airdrop create a new wallet and once you receive the tokens you can transfer them yourself to your paper wallet.

OP if you clarify what you meant you will diffuse about 100 arguments in this thread
10
BlackRock launched a tokenized money market fund on ethereum called BUIDL. Pretty big deal.
39
Ernst and Young (EY): Nightfall, Starlight
16
None of them use it in any meaningful way that is essential to their business. It's tests, proofs of concept at most.
35
PayPal runs a stablecoin on Ethereum
32
Coinbase, Stripe, Uniswap, Blackrock, Circle, Visa, Moneygram, Grab, Robinhood, to name a few.
67
If you're waiting on some sort of mass adoption event, I got bad news. ..The vast majority of applications across various industries just need a regular ol' database - simply because it provides straightforward CRUD capabilities and a centralised point of operations...The main issue is that smart contracts are immutable. Since the ledger of a blockchain can't be modified - it's only a handful of use cases that can take advantage of that sort of system. Mostly niche businesses in supply chain tracking, managing digital assets and fintech. A company like Consensys come to mind.
7
I don’t think people realize the value of blockchain for settlement. Settlement is a pain in the ass with legacy banks
10
I've bought things from vapes to woodworking tools with ETH just from sites that accept it along regular payment methods.
4
Microsoft uses it to pay vendors, and that's just the part they talk about. Lots of companies are using it, but don't want to reveal their plans, for obvious reasons.
16
Most of the utility (like games, voting, attestations, NFTs, etc) happen on L2s like Optimism and Base which rely on ethereum under the hood

It's self-evident since transaction per second speed is still very slow, the amount of useful services on it will be limited. Give it another 40 years of evolution of this type of technology, and you'll have enough TPS to allow every person on the planet to interact on a true "global singleton". That said, who uses it for what at the moment is a good question, but it should not be surprising if it is not that broadly used, even if the technology is revolutionary (as it is still too slow... "smart contracts" are revolutionary, a public ledger with public-private key cryptography is revolutionary, but the transaction per second issue has not been solved yet. )
1
Tether and Circle...Argusbly best financial business model on planet earth. So good that Tether out earned Goldman...They provide fully backed stablecoins which are used on Ethereum for permissionless transactions ...Ethereum also enables private transactions via zk proofs.______________.....BlackRock and Franklin ...Tokenized assets on Ethereum and Polygon via smart contracts to enable permissionless 24 hour global transactions of assets with near instant settlement .______________...Polymarket ...Prediction markets enabled by smartcontracts and pseudonymous accounts ...This makes predictions more accurate and outside the jurisdiction of the US

MapMetrics is a navigation app that rewards users with tokens for driving and provides speed camera alerts. This is a real-world application of crypto, demonstrating how blockchain technology can be integrated into everyday activities to provide both utility and incentives.

Venmo. If you have a gapless wallet you can store off network. It worked yesterday. I pulled Hundreds out of Ethereum. Pumped $5 in gas and deposited the change back into my Eth wallet. It was amazing and enraging.

…crypto died a long time ago…and if you disagree I’d bet you weren’t in before 2015.

I think the above auto-warning tells you all you need to know about the actual use of crypto ...
1
Every bond, share of fund, and financial instrument and derivative that can be traded is being tokenized on the etheruem network. This is massive, Blackrock is massive. Tokenization will enable simple, secure transactions, new kinds of bundling of financial products, and massive growth. It is about automating the custody, paperwork, and settlement processes in investing. Truly massive.
11
I know for a fact that other asset managers are exploring tokenised funds right now too.
2
Jesus. They just got started. Do you have any clue the technical complexity in reconfiguring tradfi for blockchain. Or maybe the whole transformation is supposed to happen over a weekend?
3
But that's how it starts...You always test before you start using a new technology. ..Especially for Blockchain you need a dedicated team to build a good product, which costs a lot of money as well

I don’t think most people realize how massive Stripe is. Among other things, it’s Amazon’s payment platform.

It’s not a new technology. My employer is using generative AI a lot more than ethereum and we are a tech savvy company. There are use cases for cryptographic tokens but not many actual problems solved  with them.

Oh I know. The future is unknown. Just telling the OP the current state without any hype.
2
Uhm, BUIDL absolutely is. Circle absolutely is. What are you even on about? How can anyone say these aren’t ‘useful’ or ‘real’? Mind blowing. Is it that they aren’t a set of complex smart contracts to qualify as a ‘dapp’? Like you need a game or a dex before it’s real?..There’s nothing saying ETH smart contracts need to have complicated behavior to be ‘real’ or ‘useful’. Thats just naive.
6
Coinbase has wallet and Base. Uniswap is a dapp. Circle is a stablecoin. Aave is a multibillion dollar lending platform. They’re major billion dollar companies. ..Many major non web3 companies have existing infrastructure in place that support their revenue streams. Most dapps will come from smaller disruptors imo. The rest will either accept it as payment or use the rails to facilitate payment.
16
That's a no-true-Scotsman fallacy. Coinbase alone has a market capitalization of 61 billion dollars, how is a 61 billion dollar company not "major"?

Yes, wrapping assets to enable, you know, all the benefits of an open distributed ledger. Thats not using the moneyness of ETH, that’s using the network to unlock a new behavior that didn’t exist before.

Basically the process of making a payment final. So in finance when it moves accounts. Know how it takes 2-3 days for banks to send funds abroad? It doesn’t need to be that way but they make money on it being that slow

This is done. Completed. Finito...Chainlink is talking to 40 banks about tokenization of financial assets and the need for an oracle to provide offchain data. LINK is executing projects around this...It will take years you realize to tokenize house deeds to complete real estate transaction. This involves many entrenched interests...Blockchain will not overtake centralized computing models but will coexist with it. Since there is trillions in sunk investment it takes time to reengineer existing infrastructure to accommodate blockchain's strength...Decentralized finance is going big guns on Ethereum, the Microsoft Windows of an established defi industry. This started several years ago...Given your criticisms I'm sure know that from the time the Internet took off in 1994 with the emergence of Netscape it was not until 2005 that AJAX and fully mature web based client server applications emerged. ..Maybe you should run these development projects then we'd see them in a matter of weeks.

Coinbase is about trading crypto. Uniswap is about trading crypto. Circle is about trading crypto. Aave is about trading crypto. It's all stuff to try to accumulate more money...OP was asking for what you can actually do with that crypto money.
72
Your proved their point
6
Well, I think the hope was to find a company not directly involved in crypto sale and exchange... ..Using coinbase to prove that it's being used is kind of like proving that a restaurant is popular because the chef keeps eating all the french fries. Yes, the restaurant is going through many french fries, just like a popular restaurant would, but the cause is within their own organization and doesn't mean that there's any genuine connection to the outside world

We tried it a few ways; .- Provably fair slots. Nobody cared. .- probably fair poker. Nobody cared. .- transferable digital assets. They buy to consume not trade, and those who trade try to earn (Axie) .- “irrevocable payments” lol that’s not an upside for any good businesses ..I worked with a lot of guys who made retirement money from eth presale and bitcoin. We worked on many ways to make it a business. Nah. ..I worked on a business funded via ICO to bring unique gaming proposition to esports fans. Nah. ..I think transferable digital ownership of non-consumable digital assets (books, movies, music) was the most promising use case a decade ago. Then streaming came, nobody cared about owning digital music anymore pretty much overnight.
2
This is naive. Circle isn't about trading crypto, it's about creating a strong digital dollar. Aave is absolutely not about trading crypto, it's decentralized loans. ..Yes, obviously it is all money-based, it is a digital financial system. What do you expect is being built here?
9
You can help fund North Korea’s weapons program
13
Let’s try to zoom out a bit, because if you think about it, cryptocurrency exists to be spent however you see fit, to hold as an investment, etc the same way fiat cash can be used. ..I think where ethereum’s use case steps in is transitioning away from centralized control of the internet, ie the 2000’s emerged social media companies which harvest and sell huge amounts of data to advertisers, 3rd parties, etc. The 2010’s brought about Stripe/Square/fintech improvements but these are also centralized, the same as banks. Ethereum provides a means where these companies don’t have to be relied on to conduct transactions and various engagements online.
3
No, OP asked:..> What major companies actually use Ethereum for anything useful at all? Smart contacts and everything. Does anyone ever use them or is it just talk?..Coinbase, Uniswap, Circle and Aave all qualify as answers to that question.
-4
Not really. Their point seems to be that nothing is being built at all, when clearly things of value are being built.
2
Yeah but like… it’s a financial platform, so all of the companies using it are going to be using it to facilitate and settle financial transactions…
1
That's not an accurate analogy. The restaurant is making money, so it can't possibly be entirely supported by its own employees eating its food. It'd be like proposing a food chain that consists entirely of predators that eat each other. There *must* be incoming coming from the outside...Again, this is adding arbitrary new limitations to what a "major company" is that OP didn't have in his question.
-4
This isn't what OP asked...For your question specifically, there are plenty of other companies that have been mentioned in this thread. Stripe, AngelList, Microsoft, PayPal, Ernst and Young, BlackRock, just to randomly repeat a few of the names others have mentioned.
2
Hundreds of billions of dollars. Millions of users. What in the hell is your criteria for adoption if that does not satisfy it?
2
Making payments on Amazon. 
2
The question was not "what major companies accept Ether," it was "what major companies *use Ethereum*."..Ether isn't intended to be a general-purpose jack-of-all-trades currency. It's the token that's used to keep Ethereum functioning smoothly, and its characteristics are tailored to make it good at that specifically. So it's fine if other uses are better served by other tokens.
11
Sure but it accepts it on the eth network.

That’s a slow ETH transaction. So worst case scenario. It can settle on L1 in seconds

it's easier to use than worldwide transfers when your employees are worldwide, it's also faster. and if you would want to, it could be tax free...  .A lot of companies with remote workers use it as a currency for salaries. Cypherphunk probably does not want to say which company he works for but there is A LOT of small/medium companies that will do this.

And what's useful about any of those?..What makes any ordinary person think "Hmm, I want X in my life. I should start using crypto for that!"

You said a bunch of words but you didn't make any cases or points.

Umm okay I'll fix the technicalities so my main point is more clear. ..The chef is very rich and buys all of the French fries..The French fries are really bad and he wouldn't be eating them if he didn't work there..Kinda like all the crypto people buying and trading ethereum on coinbase..Technically OP didn't have the limitation in their question but we are daring to venture beyond.. aren't we so brave..Here's another analogy. Ten million people have a small lizard on their shoulders. The lizards eat blackberry pda's. Everyone is buying BlackBerry PDA's in order to feed their lizards. A reddit user asks wisely if there are any people who actually *use* BlackBerry PDA's. Someone responds, "duh, ten million people use them to feed their lizards!" Another person dares to venture into the guess that op was hoping to find someone with a non lizard-feeding use -- a use that proved the PDA's were more than just lizard food
5
I disagree, that is exactly what they asked when they used the term "useful", granted buying and selling crypto can be useful, but if that is what they were asking then they wouldnt even needed to ask.
2
My criteria for adoption of a piece of technology is that the technology is used as a tool, rather than its price variation being the reason it's used.
2
No they arent. maybe someone is, but 'they' are not.
1
Exactly. Ether isn’t a currency. It isn’t for payments in the real world. Nobody should expect it to be used that way.
2
I’ve never heard of a 10 minute ethereum block time. I think you’re confusing an app who chooses xxx blocks before they’ll credit your account with actual block settlement time.
2
The lack of specificity smells like BS
1
You're making up your own criteria for "useful" and "ordinary person" here.

It’s seriously wild the willful ignorance in ignoring the financial use cases
1
They haven't contributed any further comments in this thread about what they mean by the term "useful." You don't know what they mean by that. You even grant yourself that "buying and selling crypto can be useful."

No, all those listed companies are ways for you to make more money. But what the hell am I gonna do with that money once I've got enough of it?..So far the only use I've gotten form Ethereum, was to donate to Ukraine directly, but I'm guessing they just sent it to an exchange to trade it for dollars so they could buy new equipment with the dollars.

I do grant it, it's just extremely obvious

This is like saying the stock market, venmo, robinhood, zelle, and banks are all useless because they're just ways to make or move money...This is a digital **financial** system. Yes, most of the use cases are going to be **financially** related.

No, they're not *just* ways to "make more money." And even if they were, that's not *useful*?..> But what the hell am I gonna do with that money once I've got enough of it?..What a terrible problem to have! I suggest you use it to hire someone to tell you what to do about it.

Okay, so by your standards they're useful, then.
3
It is a financial platform. Yes, most of the use cases are going to be financial related. Why type of use cases are you expecting? It seems you’re just hating to hate because you want ethereum to be something other than a financial platform.
1
Normally you trade either currencies that are accepted at most stores, stocks which give you partial ownership of a company, or materials...Whereas with ethereum, you generally need to convert it back to fiat first before you can actually use your riches.
4
>Ethereum is a technology that powers digital money, decentralized applications, and a new open internet. ..I'm looking for examples of decentralized applications that aren't all amount money. If it's not that, then Bitcoin is better, no?
1
There are now smart contract credit cards that will allow you to spend your crypto without exchanging it back to fiat. I’m building a mobile app that enables this very use case. As if it were your Chase Sapphire card within your Chase ecosystem with savings, investment account, and Zelle.
2
What you're looking for is not gonna really be around in the US for a few years. There still isn't even proper rugulation/guidelines around crypto. You're gonna have to go to a country with an unstable currency. That's where businesses and individuals are accepting crypto, specifically USDC/USDT, as payment.

"Crucial" seems like a bit of an exaggeration. If you don't already know *why* you need an Archive Full Node, you probably don't. It's entirely possible to build an archive node from a non-archive node, so you have all the information you need to build it after you've fast synced a node.
7
Can you please, just, not post things like this?..Bitcoin maxi's get latched onto the immense requirements of running an archive node and confuse archive nodes with full nodes.  And most people don't understand the distinction (or the fact that Bitcoin has no equivalent) enough to correct them...Your article is going to get linked by maxi's for years now talking about how "centralized" ethereum is due to their own lack of understanding.  Not your fault, but you're making things much worse.
7
The reasons in this are very vague. Something something historical data. It's pretty unusual to find a problem where an archive node is the best solution. For most purposes a normal node is fine, and when it isn't you'd often be better off making a custom index.
3
Exactly this.
2
I don't care what the bitcoin maxis say but I do worry that somebody's going to waste a load of time trying to run their software in a way that doesn't help them, or worse use a hosted service when they'd have had a better experience running a normal local node...If anyone from Allnodes is reading, please don't do marketing like this, it doesn't enhance your reputation to put it mildly.

Sequencer fees. Transactions require gas, gas has a price. Many transactions are bundled and committed to the l1, which requires gas, and again gas has a price. The l2 takes margin here, so that is the value capture. More transactions = more earnings. Adjust the price as needed.

You know how Mastercard and Visa often charge something like ~1% for card transactions? It's almost like a hidden tax where both the customer and merchant lose out (deadweight loss)...Now compare that to L2's, which are currently hovering around half a cent (~$0.005) for transactions that will only become cheaper over time. And due to Ethereum's inherited security and open nature, now there's an opportunity for competing L2 payment networks to provide cheaper fees or a better service if any dominating L2 payment processors were to begin taking advantage of their monopolistic positions (and that's not even mentioning the unique advantages that applications such as DeFi enable)...So in this scenario, both the merchant and customer benefit...And instead of payment card network processors completely monopolizing digital payments, now there's an alternative option that's: cheaper, trustless, open source, innovative, and enables/allows true ownership of digital assets.

Yes, I understand all the benefits of an L2..But what are the incentives and the business model for the companies that are building L2?..For example, how does Matter Labs make money from zkSync Era? At the moment, they're making money because they own the sequencers and take the fees. But eventually, sequencers will be decentralized and run by third parties. So how will Matter Labs make money?

Did it occur to you at any point in this that falsifying market activity with the intent to sell a token for more than it's worth may not have been ethical?..My experience with these is that the majority of teams doing the launches just do back to back launches with new identities each time, so they can reuse far more of their assets than you would expect otherwise.

yes, since I am more familiar with Lido's stETH, will try to explain stETH.  .In normal conditions, stETH gets postive rebase which mean the balance is increasing...If few slashing events take place and the (instant and subsequent) losses could be covered by the rewards, stakers' stETH still gets positive rebase...If there is a massive slashing event, stETH may get negetive rebase, which means stETH balance could decrease...However, no massive slashing takes place in Lido so far and Lido has an insurance fund to try to cover as much as possible.
3
rETH works the same as the other poster described with Lido...Only difference being on Rocket Pool validators are required to put up (minimum) 10% collateral before participating. In case of bad or malicious validation this collateral is taken away from first (and the validator removed from the Ethereum network) before the Rocket Pool network experiences any penalties. If some% of validators are slashed beyond this 10%, as an rETH holder you'd notice a temporary decrease in APR but wouldn't be slashed yourself. Only if a large% of validators are slashed at the same time would the ETH backing the rETH pool be affected, meaning how much ETH you can redeem your rETH for...I outlined the most likely case for a large slashing event in my other post. The other case for mass slashing would be majority collusion, which I don't think is likely at all. Either case would be extremely bad for Ethereum and most (not all) stakers....Client diversity is KEY (ie *not* using a majority client). Since RP is permissionless I can only assume not all validators are using the same one client... The minority of validators still online after a mass slashing event would receive a great boost in staking rewards, so the rETH APR would increase 2-3fold despite its value decreasing proportionately to how much ETH was slashed - too many variables to guess when/if those two would balance out, but with an APR under 10% it would probably take a very long time.
2
Thank you very much for the explanation! What could cause a massive slashing event?
1
This is great info. Thanks a lot!
1
If there's a bug in a validator client. The more validators slashed at once, the more severe the penalty is. If GETH with its 55% majority proposes two blocks with the same header# simultaneously and verifies them both, the network would think it's being attacked which could result in an up to 100% slashing penalty. If only a few validators experience a bug, or fumble their job/machine, the penalty is much lower.
2
Do you know if there is a document explaining what are the different slashing conditions? I guess this must all happen automatically, slashing is triggered algorithmically and not manually by other validators
1
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/..>There are three ways a validator can be slashed, all of which amount to the dishonest proposal or attestation of blocks:..>By proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot..>By attesting to a block that "surrounds" another one (effectively changing history)..>By "double voting" by attesting to two candidates for the same block..>If these actions are detected, the validator is slashed. This means that 1/32 of their staked ether (up to a maximum of 1 ether) is immediately burned, then a 36 day removal period begins. During this removal period the validator's stake gradually bleeds away. At the mid-point (Day 18) an additional penalty is applied whose magnitude scales with the total staked ether of all slashed validators in the 36 days prior to the slashing event. This means that when more validators are slashed, the magnitude of the slash increases. The maximum slash is the full effective balance of all slashed validators (i.e. if there are lots of validators being slashed they could lose their entire stake). On the other hand, a single, isolated slashing event only burns a small portion of the validator's stake. This midpoint penalty that scales with the number of slashed validators is called the "correlation penalty"...There is also what's called an inactivity leak. This is different from slashing generally, but can result in lost ETH as well. If your validator is offline or misconfigured for any reason you experience this leak, it is about proportional to the amount of rewards earned through a day - ie being offline for 7 days you will need to be online for 7 days to break even once again. This leak also occurs whenever the chain is unable to reach finality, which I'll go into below....https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/..Ethereum uses a 66.67% consensus majority. This means even if 33.34% if the network is in disagreement with the majority, the majority can be slashed and removed from the network. It also means if 33.34% is in disagreement the chain cannot finalize and inactivity leaks begin until the 33.34% falls under its 1/3 majority naturally over time...Validators are also able to manually slash other validators. This happens during attestation when validators are randomly selected to verify the last series of blocks (during each epoch, 6 minutes, how long it takes for the chain reach tx finality). The validator who detects a phony or malicious block is able to collect the slashing reward for themselves, which are typically just burned in all other cases. This leads to a prisoners dellima of sorts which is good for security (making collusion effectively impossible, either lie and help break Ethereum or be honest for a large reward)...The slashing consequences and network behavior differ when 34-50-67% of the network is in disagreement with each other. ..Note: Rocketpool has voted to limit themselves at IIRC 20% of the total ETH stake, as part of a coordinated effort from most staking services to maintain Ethereum's integrity/robustness. Lido on the other hand has claimed there is no issue if they gain 100% of the total stake, this is their business model - some see Lido as a malicious entity as a result and advise against its usage, in part due to their centralization...It's in the cases of a 50-66.65% fork being rejected that would result in the most lost ETH. About 55% of validators are using GETH currently, so other than a very contentious action happening I believe a critical GETH error is the only way that could manifest as of today. There is an effort to get people to use minority clients, some EIPs are proposed that would increase validator yields for doing such, but people are always complacent and slow to act.. Assuming 75% of Rocket Pool validators are using GETH a validator mass slashing event that rejected GETH validators would result in rETH being backed with 25% the ETH that it should be...A contentious action may be something along the lines of USDT demanding validators use their modified execution client which grants them a 0.1% tax of every transaction, or else will not honor USDT redemptions any longer. 67% of validators may have greater than 32ETH worth of USDT on DeFi so would be incentivized to choose this new client and fork choice to maximize profit/minimize loss. This is extremely unlikely, especially as there's more ETH at stake than USDT in circulation, but just one quick example I could think of...>If 1/3 or more of the staked ether is maliciously attesting or failing to attest, then a 2/3 supermajority cannot exist and the chain cannot finalize. The defense against this is the inactivity leak. The inactivity leak identifies those validators that are failing to attest or attesting contrary to the majority. The staked ether owned by these non-attesting validators is gradually bled-away until eventually they collectively represent less than 1/3 of the total so that the chain can finalize again...>The purpose of the inactivity leak is to get the chain finalizing again. However, the attacker also loses a portion of their staked ether. Persistent inactivity across validators representing 33% of the total staked ether is very expensive even though the validators are not slashed...>At 50% of the staked ether, a mischievous group of validators could theoretically split the chain into two equally sized forks and then simply use their entire 50% stake to vote contrarily to the honest validator set, thereby maintaining the two forks and preventing finality. The inactivity leak on both forks would eventually lead both chains to finalize. At this point, the only option is to fall back on a social recovery...>At >50% of the total stake the attacker could dominate the fork choice algorithm. In this case, the attacker would be able to attest with the majority vote, giving them sufficient control to do short reorgs without needing to fool honest clients. The honest validators would follow suit because their fork choice algorithm would also see the attacker’s favored chain as the heaviest, so the chain could finalize. This enables the attacker to censor certain transactions, do short-range reorgs and extract maximum MEV by reordering blocks in their favor. The defense against this is the huge cost of a majority stake (currently just under $83 billion USD) which is put at risk by an attacker because the social layer is likely to step in and adopt an honest minority fork, devaluing the attacker’s stake dramatically...>An attacker with 66% or more of the total staked ether can finalize their preferred chain without having to coerce any honest validators. The attacker can simply vote for their preferred fork and then finalize it, simply because they can vote with a dishonest supermajority. As the supermajority stakeholder, the attacker would always control the contents of the finalized blocks, with the power to spend, rewind and spend again, censor certain transactions and reorg the chain at will. By purchasing additional ether to control 66% rather than 51%, the attacker is effectively buying the ability to do ex post reorgs and finality reversions (i.e. change the past as well as control the future). The only real defenses here are the enormous cost of 66% of the total staked ether, and the option to fall back to the social layer to coordinate adoption of an alternative fork. We can explore this in more detail in the next section.

This is a fantastic asnwer, thanks a lot!..What is your opinion on this:  .\`\`\`  .Note: Rocketpool has voted to limit themselves at IIRC 20% of the total ETH stake, as part of a coordinated effort from most staking services to maintain Ethereum's integrity/robustness. Lido on the other hand has claimed there is no issue if they gain 100% of the total stake, this is their business model - some see Lido as a malicious entity as a result and advise against its usage, in part due to their centralization.  .\`\`\`..Also can effectively Lido use users stETH to interrupt Ethereum finality?

PSA to anyone else that sees this:..There's no such thing as an simple way to make money with MEV. MEV is extremely competitive, searchers hold their strategies closely, nobody is making a public bot or youtube video teaching other people how to make money instead of just doing it themselves.
25
The address 0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4 is so busy because it's an address of a non-custodial exchanger. It does not belong to the scammers. They just used it to convert your funds to another currency, probably monero.
7
It belongs to Changenow which is an exchange allowing you to transfer coins and tokens across different networks and wallets, without direct link...Hackers and scammers use it to try and break their money trails.

I was almost scammed by the same Uniswap bot back in 2022. I just had a feeling it's too good to be true so I did some research on twitter and found out it was a scam. I'm sorry for your loss though. Have you had any progress trying to retrieve your funds?

Probably not, no. In case the scammer really converted it to Monero, there is nothing really you can do I guess. If the scammer converted it to a traceable coin, even then the chances are low as the amount will probably not be worth any investigation. Sorry for your loss!

There definitely is, although I don't know if it's worth you pursuing. You can check to see if the exchange is KYC, and if they have an obligation to some jurisdiction to reveal information about the deposits if subpoenaed. Although law usually won't enforce for only $2k, but if the scammer goes down eventually, maybe you'll get your $2k in with 10 years from now. Maybe that $2k would be worth much more. ..It's up to you if you want to file a police report. It'll just get shelved for years, and there's like a 1% chance you'll get your money back

ZK rollups still need to post enough data to Ethereum in order for people to recreate the state of the rollup so they also have call data...Essentially a merkle root of the state of the rollup is stored on Ethereum. The whole merkle tree is stored by the rollup nodes. If the rollup nodes were to shut down, everyone's funds would be frozen. Enough data to recreate the whole merkle tree needs to be posted to Ethereum so either other people can start up rollup nodes or merkle proofs of assets can be created in case the rollup nodes shut down without sharing it...So zk rollups also need blobs

On hyperliquid  is a thing called funds which does this. While I want to encourage you to build your own contract to make the learning I also want to warn you that you may need a contract audit for people to trust your contract. .There is no easy fix for your crosschain problem, but you could have the fund trade on only one chain but distribute the token on multiple chains,  but if someone wants to redeem he needs to bridge back first. .I have built such a contract pretty similar to what you want to build (single chain, EVM compatible) if you want the code and I'd also be interested to give your JCT a chance, happy to connect.

I'm deploying a protocol on fantom (soon Sonic) soon, where anyone can create an index token, and others can join a strategy. One of the abilities is for Owners of the indexes can swap between underlying assets, which provides opportunities for people to hook up bots. There will also be built in manager fees.
1
I plan to verify the contract source code on etherscan, so everyone can see the source code...I thought all L2s are supposed to be in the same system. After all, that's why L2s are not side chains isn't it? If calculating the sum of a quantity across multiple L2s is so difficult, I think L2 still has a long way to go. Is there any plan to enable this kind of interoperability?
2
Sounds interesting, but I want to make my own smart contract.
1
They’re not interoperable that way for now. The L2 interoperability is unfortunately not trivial to implement. ..I wanted to build a lending protocol where you can post collateral across multiple chains, but it seems to be extremely difficult to implement trustlessly. It’s one of the things that’s limiting about L2 for now. ..I’d recommend using traditional bridges and only allow ETH deposits and withdrawals on 1 chain. The code is also easier to implement and is safer as well.

Meme coins will wreck you...Solana is for degens. If you want network instability and centralisation you can go there.
6
Trading meme coins here involves higher and more volatile gas fees compared to Solana, impacting smaller trades. Ethereum offers greater liquidity and a larger market, but with more competition and potential market manipulation. Transactions are generally slower on Ethereum, and the development environment uses Solidity for smart contracts, which differs from Solana's. These factors make trading on Ethereum distinct from Solana.
2
I don't trade meme coins, but I think you'll find most on the Base rollup, but Arbitrum and Optimism will have some too....Transactions on those rollups are practically instant, and fees about $0.01.
2
High fees.
1
The first part is true, the latter is a load of bull

What about scam tokens there ? In Sol lots of tokens are straight up rug pulls ... How it is in base ?
2
Rollups cheaper than sol

I never understood why anyone would bother releasing meme coins on ETH mainnet. put that shit on a cheap rollup or something.
2
Huge outages. Coordinated chain restarts...Uh?
2
Where theres people and money there is corruption.
2
I don't know, but do meme tokens have any other purpose than rug pulling and pump & dumps?
1
The only thing I'll agree with you on is the outtages it had, the restarts weren't very coordinated as they were put for weeks last time waiting for every single validator to get the memo and apply the patch.         .It's not nearly as decentralized as ethereums L1, true, but there's not a single L2 that I know of that comes close, and the L1 isn't really usable in the current form, so if we're comparing apples to apples I'd say it's still more decentralized than any L2,and yes I own both
-2
Many many outages of different kinds. Dos attacks. Congestion...The fact that it's possible to coordinate a chain restart over discord is proof enough of the centralisation...How isn't layer 1 ethereum usable? There's a fee market. You pay the fee. Your transaction goes through...As apart of the rollup centric roadmap, ethereum has created a Web of infrastructure, layers, bridges, Etc, that allow for scalability...Ethereum layer 2 solutions aren't decentralised, you're right, but at the pace that the Ethereum ecosystem is evolving, that will change quickly.

idk but it feels a bit better..We can stash gold all we want, but if shit hits the fan, gold becomes worthless, and it depends on who is willing to take it as a form of payment and at what rate. I can go with it in my pocket and someone can just take it away from me, and i have to give it by hand..Crypto is way more flexible, and if stored non-custodial way, there is no way of someone taking it from you, and at this point there is enough critical mass to accept crypto as a legal tender (i bought the very laptop im writing this on with crypto, i bought a car with it, i pay with it, i accept payments with crypto cus i know people that would take it)..And believe it or not, there are people that dont see 1 ETH as 3000 USD, but as 1 ETH, we owe them one big thank you

It’s the same ETH. It is worth the same amount. As long as it is on base, you can only buy things on the base chain. But that is true of every chain. You can always bridge it back-and-forth anytime you want.
3
If you think that bridge is ROCK SOLID then it's fine. If you don't get any use out of the ETH, anyway, then might as well keep it on Ethereum - it's safer. Bridges are an additional layer that can get hacker or w/e.

Switch your eth to Iota Evm, you can switch with lowest fee's < 0,001$ to any other supported evm chains. ..Check out Layerzero.

I keep funds on Arbitrum..These L2 are centralized. .So be aware
0
Pro tip:..BASE has not yet issued its own token.  There’s a high likelihood they’ll do so, and that when they do, it will involve an airdrop to reward early users of the chain...For that reason, I’m keeping some funds on BASE and trading a bit there.  Unless you use that ETH to become an LP in a lucrative pair on L1, I think there’s likely to be more upside (until they release a token) if you stick to using BASE.
-2
I mean mostly I wanted to buy an nft I really like and keep the rest in my wallet, so I think I will stick with base for now. 🙂
1
Yes..But there's a slight difference...As explained [here](https://cryptobriefing.com/vitalik-buterin-skeptical-of-cross-chain-bridges/), "it is safer to keep custody of a native blockchain’s assets in that same native blockchain than it is to store them on a non-native blockchain.".

Okay, thanks
1
It's possible they will do an airdrop, although arguably they might not. Airdrops are marketing tactics and insider value extraction tactics. Base is gigantic and led by the largest US exchange. Anyone in crypto already knows it exists. Personally, I doubt an airdrop will happen but it's possible. If they due, it's strictly a value extraction play for insiders.

thanks

If you read Vitalik's full comment linked in that article, he is referring to holding ETH on Ethereum (**which includes L2s like Base**) being safer in comparison to holding a wrapped version of SOL from Solana's chain on Ethereum (*and vice versa*)...>Now, imaging what happens if you move 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there's a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it's still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this...>**For this reason, it's always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum**. **And in this context, "Ethereum" refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it.** If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so "cross-rollup" applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked. And if Ethereum does *not* get 51% attacked, there's no way to 51% attack Arbitrum and Optimism separately. Hence, holding assets issued on Optimism wrapped on Arbitrum is still perfectly safe.
6
Lots of people who own other cryptocurrencies have no awareness that BASE exists at this time, which was a big part of the reason they launched BRETT...In my experience awareness that Coinbase is behind it is also not terribly high among the type of people who are seeking out memecoins...If they decided not to reward early users with tokens when they launch one, they'd be the first L2 to my knowledge to fail to do so.  I think the likelihood of that is slim.
1
Yeah, I read that too after sending the message..But I'm not sure to understand it completely...I don't understand how keeping ETH on an L2 would be as safe as keeping it o Ethereum L1.
1
The people who invest in memecoins are not going to get much from an Airdrop anyway. It's primarily gamed by devs that can automate and insiders who know the algorithm...Yes, the argument that they will do an airdrop is a good one because they can game it and make tons of more money than if they didn't. But to those who know how airdrops work, it's a liquidity trap
1
Any L2 ETH persists inside of the L1 by definition. It never goes off-chain or leaves the L1. ..You're just leasing the L2 to move your ETH within the L1 smart contract. It does this in batches of large numbers and via fancy compression techniques (while utilizing blobs, which have a separate fee market from blocks), reducing the network cost to move balances around vs you doing it individually...If the L2 censors, goes offline, breaks, or otherwise fails to do its job you just revert back to L1 to move your funds out of the L1 contract instead, and that can be done without the L2's help/permission. This would be inconvenient if you're avoiding L1 fees, but not insecure. Even in malicious attempts the L2 cannot steal or misappropriate your ETH/crypto-assets since those remain secured by L1 validators...You are right to assume not every L2 is inherently as secure as the L1. Not every L2 is a "real L2" with this sort of scheme in place yet, many are still in their early-beta days with admin keys that can change the contract functions (to avoid detrimental bugs during live testing, and to upgrade to a final/decentralized state more efficiently), however Base(which is really Optimism) is not one of those L2's. Stage 0 L2's have no fraud proofs and are centralized, Stage 1 has fraud proofs, and Stage 2 has fraud proofs and are maximally decentralized. You can compare risks/progress of all the different L2's at L2beat. Any L2 with "fraud proofs" allows you to force-exit from the contract even if the L2 has gone offline.

OP this is gonna be complicated so follow along...What OP could maybe do is to buy/sell a contract to buy ETH at X price. This at least ensures that should OP win, he’d know that his winnings can pay off X amount of ETH. If he loses, he’d need to buy ETH at X price, from his own pocket. However, assuming ETH is X price now, OP could sell his ETH at X price now. ..Let’s give it an example in numerical terms for clarification. OP sells 5 ETH for let’s say 2K each for a total of 10K USDC today. OP then buys a contract to buy 5 ETH at 2K on election day for a total cost of 10K USDC. He now bets 10K USDC against Trump with a 2x payout, meaning he’ll win 10K USDC if Trump loses. ..On election day, Trump loses. OP wins 10K USDC, which is then used to settle his contract. This results in OP effectively winning 5 ETH, no matter the price of ETH on election day. This means that OP wins 5 ETH against his original 5 ETH. ..If Trump wins, OP loses his original 10K USDC, and has to buy 5ETH for 10K (or void the contract). This means that OP effectively loses 5ETH, no matter the price of ETH on that day. ..Of course we haven’t taken into account of premiums etc. ..In short, buying contracts ensures ETH is at the same price now and on election day, so that OP could bet in USDC now and still has a fixed ETH price on election day, effectively turning the bet into an ETH bet.

Are there any L2s in particular that would suite Augur? I wonder how much work it would be to re-deploy it, I guess its all open source.

Last time I checked you could deposit ETH into Bovada then it was converted to USD for balances and bets. Generally on Bovada you can't bet on something to NOT happen. Bovada currently has no US election markets up.

Arbitrum/Base/Optimism all have subcent fees and are 'ETH equivalent' meaning the same contracts can be deployed there. Polymarket runs on Polygon, so that seems like a viable option too...Optimism and Arbitrum were designed so they can be forked and still inherit the security features of the L2. Base for example is a fork of Optimism, part of the OPstack/Superchain (Arbitrum chains are called Orbits). This way when Optimism upgrades to further decentralize or turn into a ZK-rollup Coinbase can inherit those features with very little work in their Base L2, leaving them to focus solely on scaling Base for the best UX without worrying about security/zero knowledge proofs etc. I'd love to see specialized app-layers emerge as these forks (eg: OPCraft) rather than tons and tons of 'ETH equivalent' chains that we don't really need...If it's all open source it should be pretty straight forward to redeploy on L2 for relatively little cost. The fact no one has done it sort of makes me think it wasn't all open source, maybe the frontend was closed source and did a bit more than it lead on. I haven't looked into it whatsoever so just positing, but it is weird especially given Polymarket's great success lately (basically turning out to be this season's NFT or DeFi craze).

Most CEXes like Binance allow you to buy fixed dated ETH contracts. Most DEX don’t offer such contracts and are usually perpetual contracts which doesn’t suit your needs. There are a few DEX that allows you to buy these “traditional” contracts but I’m wouldn’t put too much money into these platforms. ..I’d highly recommend buying these contracts on a  CEX that has a license in your country.

Please walk me through it..Put up ETH and borrow USDC on Aave...Take the USDC to polymarket and win...Go back to Aave with the same amount of USDC I got from there and get back the same amount of ETH I gave no matter what the price change has been in the meantime? I have effectively frozen the exchange rate?..The amount of USDC I have left was the amount I profited.

Format your computer, make sure to choose the option that removes everything. ..And get yourself a hardware wallet, never input your seeds onto your computer. ..Make sure to not download anything random in the future too. If someone asks, check the items on Twitter etc first. Sometimes others have been exploited also.

Stop using wallets on computers you also download other shit on...Reformat your computer now. To the core.

Hey, one more thing..I got tonnes of DMs regarding recovery of funds by many people. That's a scam right? Just to confirm once.

OP you don’t need to drop $180 or whatever on a hardware wallet to keep things safe..You can go with a free multi-sig option like Gnosis, or keep your key literally printed/written out and stored offline in a couple places (a version of what folks call “cold storage”)..Or both

Before you run and get a hardware wallet, double check the known scams and issues in the related subreddit. For instance, people buying ledgetwallets from eBay have bought compromised hardware wallets.

True, but I think for OP in this case simpler is better - no seed phrases on the computer, ever. No need for the top-end hardware wallet, just the $79 Trezor Safe 3 can do.

Fake emit transaction. ..Nothing left ur account. ..They effectively broadcasted a fake transaction using the public information on the blockchain. This is meant to scare u and trick u into thinking u sent funds out, prompting u to accidentally interact with the foreign address. ..This can also be seen as a form of address poisoning since u now have a foreign address in ur operation history. ..Ignore these types of fake tx’s and u will be fine.

Rent is native Solana behaviour and not in the Ethereum protocol. So what you are asking for cannot on exist on Ethereum currently.
5
Some blockchains like Chia requires that all tokens are minted using a positive amount of their utility token that you can get back when your burn them but this is not the case for Ethereum. Of course, Ethereum smart contract developers are free to implement this in their tokens/NFTs if they want, but I don't think it is a common practice.

It's also the chain that transfers the most value each day (~ 4x more than Bitcoin):..https://money-movers.info/..And has the most economic security (cost to attack the network):..https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4727999..It has about twice as much value in it's DeFi ecosystem as every other crypto combined:..https://defillama.com/chains..And it has more developers working in its ecosystem than the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place chains combined (and the 5th largest is an Ethereum L2):..https://www.developerreport.com/..Add to all that, traditional financial institutions (such as Blackrock, the biggest asset management company in the world) *"are coalescing around open-source #Ethereum for tokenization"*:..https://x.com/matthew_sigel/status/1801342560977190937..And the tokenization of real world assets is already 85% on Ethereum:..https://dune.com/queries/3083611.......There's a few more points for you.
13
Most decentralized smart contract chain by a mile. Which is one of it's most important strengths IMHO.
23
You might want to explicitly call out the fact that Ethereum's energy consumption is negligible compared to Bitcoin...The proof-of-stake system also has *far* less economy of scale than proof-of-work. Economy of scale is a strong centralizing pressure...BTC is just as much a "store of value" as any other cryptocurrency.
7
Id say you missed out on one of the most crucial Design Philosophy / differentiator:..Ethereum takes a radical no bullshit approach when it comes to decentralization and credible neutrality. Where "competitors" like Solana et. al. take every shortcut possible to try and claw themselves into relevancy no matter the Philosophical sacrifice, Ethereum does the technical heavy Lifting with the by far largest and best dev and Research teams in the space to build somethimg that can actually become the protocol for the Internet of value for tomorrow, which means scailing the hard way while retaining decentralization.
2
A few nits - eth has been inflationary since traffic started moving off chain after Dencun 4 months ago ..Store of value is not a technology, it's just a basic property that Eth has just as much claim as Bitcoin does...Eth and BTC separate themselves from everything else because they are the only projects that have decentralization and a significant market cap...Ethereum has smart contracts, the largest developer community, a roadmap, and energy efficiency...Bitcoin has simplicity, first mover advantage, market cap, name recognition, PoW (which is a strength or weakness depending on who you ask), and has certainty due to its status as a commodity, it's simple goals, and hard-scheduled issuance rates.

Following

Comparing ETH to BTC is like comparing NVIDIA and Amazon, or men and women. You can't equitably compare things that are fundamentally different. From an investment standpoint, I see no reason not to own both.
1
Easily the most decentralized layer 1 and also boasts the most developer activity. With the continuous efforts being put in by rollup-centric frameworks such as Fuel, Fluent, Lumio, and Cartesi etc, its attractiveness to Web2/Web3 developers will only continue to go up a notch.
1
I think the vast majority of people outside of crypto and probably a majority in crypto are majorly underestimating how huge nfts are. ..Anyways good list. ..I am curious though. Will ethereum ever be able to attain fast enough TPS to make L2s obsolete? Will there always be a need for L2s?

What are the most widely used practical applications on the Ethereum blockchain today? It still seems like mostly a gambling device to me.

Read "Broken Money" and you will have a different perspective of Ethereum....It lost its immutability during the DAO hack when it split. It's history can be changed or deleted....It also lost its Decentralization when it switched to Proof of Stake. It will become more and more centralized as money keeps going to the large Stake holders who will gain more percentage as time passes. ...It also lost its Trusted Ledger and proof of history with Proof of Stake. If a blackout were to happen, which chain would be followed in a proof of stake system when it starts back up? Solana had this issue already....I'm not hating, I only own both and nothing else but I know Ethereum will never be Bitcoin, but Bitcoin can take properties from Ethereum or have them done on second layers....Ethereum's main function in my mind was to be the Blockchain of Blockchains allowing developers to not have to worry about mining, users, or network and can bootstrap onto its system. Now we have 100,000 shit coins because any scammer or developer can make a token.

>First mover advantage for smart contract technology space; strong brand recognition as the hegemon, similarly to BTC in the cryptocurrency space but specifically in the smart contract space;.."Smart Contracts" have been around prior to the advent of blockchain.  In the database world, they're called "stored procedures" and they have much more power and flexibility than Ethereum's version...>Smart Contract tech vs. BTC's store of value tech is a more wide-ranging use case in an ever-digitising world..Technology is a "tool".  Not a "use case."  It remains to be seen if any SC technology actually excels in any particular use-case.   I maintain [the official list of blockchain claims](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/) and in 15 years, nobody has been able to cite a single thing blockchain does better than non-blockchain tech...>Network size/development history; proven trackrecord of success and improvements so far, and imaginably this will continue even despite competitors like SOL..What "success" are you referring to?  To date, there's not a single thing *any* blockchain app has done that's better than existing non-blockchain applications...>Many Layer 2s and Stablecoins rely on the ETH network so their success feeds into ETH's (and vice versa) - with the example of Polygon, it provides ETH more scalability, lowers the fees and increases the speeds, at least until ETH itself is able to achieve these feats within the first layer..Again, begging the question with this presumption of "success."  The L2s in most cases with blockchain, do not expand functionality as much as they compensate for limitations in the base design.  Eth may be slightly more scalable than BTC, but again, it's still nowhere near remotely competitive with existing non-blockchain ledger systems that have been in use decades prior to the advent of blockchain...>(At present) disinflationary due to burn rate; not so negative in the face of long term holding in this particular area..The inflation/deflation argument is a marketing gimmick, not a legitimate feature.  Anybody championing a money system as being deflationary doesn't understand basic economics and how money is supposed to work in society...>Staking (at least if you have a lot of ether or you want to be a part of a staking pool)..Another marketing gimmick with no actual utility beyond pandering to degenerate gamblers who want to excercise highly leveraged gambling.  Staking creates no value or utility and is just an excuse to reduce the likelihood of there being bank runs on the limited available liquidity in the market, which if done to a certain extent, will cause the ponzi to collapse...>NFTs (I mean some people think that's important, right?)..Again, another marketing gimmick, designed primarily to create an illusory "use case" and "perception of value" where in reality, there are none...>Good history for going up in value already, and a better record in this area than BTC, making it potentially more bullish; Spot ETF on the way already too..Nope.  Identical to BTC in terms of having zero intrinsic value and no way to create value or utility in the real world in any competitive way.  Any and all "number go up" metrics are primarily a function of wash trading, market manipulation and market inflation caused by billions of unsecured, un-audited stablecoins being arbitrarily introduced into the market.

Important information.....Bitcoin HAS 'smart contracts" too......stop throwing your value away on a shit coin...
-1
> And has the most economic security (cost to attack the network)..Most of theses analysis focus on the cost to buy Asics or tokens to attack the network...This is interesting but what if someone can override property rights ? If you don't need to buy Asics or eth but you can use the already owned ones ? The governments can do that and they don't need to be profitable...We seen a portion of that power with tornado cash and the OFAC compliance. All that just with réglementations...Most of analysis don't take that in consideration, but I would be interested to see analysis about this.

BTC is just as much a “store of value” as any other cryptocurrency…...No other crypto has as secure of a network as BTC and no other crypto is as predictable as BTC. You can use many different things as a store of value but that doesn’t mean all stores of value are equally as desirable.

>  In the database world, they're called "stored procedures" and they have much more power and flexibility than Ethereum's version...Yes, except, in a regular database, any admin can update the code at will. You seem to miss something absolutely fundamental about blockchains. The value of decentralization.
3
You say there is not a single thing blockchain does better then non-blockchain tech. I disagree. The sending and receiving of value on the blockchain far exceeds anything before it. Example…....https://financefeeds.com/bitcoin-breaks-all-records-with-a-massive-1-347-billion-transaction/..1.347 billion dollars worth of value was sent between two parties for a cost of 2.06. No bank or payment processor could come close to the speed and efficiency made possible on the blockchain. ..You also claim that staking has no value and is a gimmick. Ser staking is how the network is secured. Bitcoin uses miners/electricity and ethereum uses stakers/liquidity. ...My final point of contention…...Nfts is not a gimmick it is a technology. An extremely disruptive and revolutionary technology. ..At it’s core it is just a tech innovation that allows for trustless authentication and verification of anything. Physical, digital, time and space are all domains where nfts are applicable.

> No other crypto has as secure of a network as BTC ..Very much depends on your metrics...>  and no other crypto is as predictable as BTC...This one is outright false. Super easy to disprove, barely an inconvenience. For example, make these two predictions:..* If I buy $1000 worth of BTC right now, how much will it be worth one year from now?.* If I buy $1000 worth of DAI right now, how much will it be worth one year from now?..Over the past year BTC's price went from a low of $34,000 to a high of $98,500 and is currently back down to $78,800...Over the past year DAI's price went from a high of $1.0012 to a low of $0.9979 and is currently at $1.0001...There are cryptos that are *designed* for stability. Bitcoin is not one of them.

How so?..Ethereums economic security (cost to 51% attack the network) has surpassed bitcoins ages ago...Additionally, the two biggest mining pools on bitcoin build 50% of all blocks. That means only by Controlling two entities, half the blocks on bitcoin can be censored...Looks significantly better on ethereum

This, like most crypto "bridges" with the real world (web3, A.I., NFTs, "tokenized assets", etc. etc.) will be up front in the crypto news narrative for a little bit, then when that fades, we'll be back to where we started from.  These ETFs are just desperate attempts to try and get people who invest in real stuff, to try gambling at the highly speculative crypto casino.  **It never lasts**.

Just a reminder: ETFs still don't answer "the Ultimate Crypto Question" which remains un-answered after 15 years: Name one specific (non-criminal) thing blockchain is better at than existing non-blockchain technology?   That simple question remains unanswered, going into the second decade of crypto hyperbole.

gary the egg never approved anything, the one department in the sec did the approval. the other 3 departments never approved it. bitcoin was approved by all four departments, including egg head...this is going to get interesting. if anyone has worked in these environments, you would know how spicy things can get behind the scenes. would love to see gary in these meetings.

It means investment funds and pension funds will now be able to get exposure to eth in a reliable way. ..The biggest comparisons are with the gold ETF that happened in 2004 and Bitcoin in January. ..When the gold ETF was approved the price went up by like x7 over a 10 year period. ..But when we compare the launch of the gold ETF and Bitcoin ETF. The gold ETF is actually a tiny little launch 😂 ..Bitcoin got waaaaay more money into the ETF in a few months than gold did when it launched. Which means the growth should be even better for Bitcoin long term. ..In terms of ETH we will have to wait and see how much money is flowing I to it in the first few months to see a comparison. ..But overall this is a good thing that they are approving it. It means that they are now accepting crypto as a legit financial instrument. Both of the biggest players Bitcoin and ethereum. Are pretty safe now I. In terms of getting banned or some bullshit like that.

I said the same about Bitcoin's ETF but I was 200% wrong. We are no longer in the amateur markets of 2015. It's no longer the pump and dump ran by a few whales. It's now a professional market. After a few meetings the institutions will jumpin, you watch!

ETH fudders need to sit back and rethink their entire thesis. Every single argument they have is being disproven. First it was the merge, then it was scaling, then the whole security argument. This moment solidifies Ethereum.

It's better at keeping any immutable record. Every other technology requires a trusted custodian. It's already way better at this, it's just not being used as much as it could be. ..Do you want irrefutable proof that a photo or video existed at a specific time and have been manipulated since? Publish a hash on the block chain. Pre-register a hypothesis? Blockchain does immutability better than any other technology in existence.

> It's better at keeping any immutable record...Not by any meaningful metric.  A log file with cryptographic signing that is posted to multiple places is probably more reliable, and it doesn't help money launderers and human traffickers...>Every other technology requires a trusted custodian...This is another myth, that blockchain doesn't require middlemen and trust.  in fact, quite the contrary.  Instead of known middlemen that can be held accountable (such as centralized authorities, government and well-regulated corporations) you guys instead replace them with random, anonymous people and coders who are under no obligation whatsoever to be moral or ethical - they're exclusively motivated by their own selfish material interests.  I'd say believing the latter group is more reliable requires tremendously more trust...>Do you want irrefutable proof that a photo or video existed at a specific time and have been manipulated since? ..Look up, "The Oracle Problem."   Blockchain is only as reliable as the humans who submit data onto that system.  Blockchain itself isn't the mechanism of trust...This is a great example of how you've fabricated a problem you claim blockchain solves (somebody modifying data after it's been written to a database) which is not a problem anybody ever actually deals with.  If you have trusted Oracles, then the method of data storage is irrelevant...>Blockchain does immutability better than any other technology in existence...No it doesn't.  it's slower and more resource intensive than thousands of older, better technology that can do the same thing...And the big problem with blockchain is: *tokenization*.   Your desire to decentralize the database means that the database is only as dependable as the solid value of the tokens around which its ecosystem depends.  So if ETH or BTC at any point in the future, no longer becomes desirable and stops going up in price (which is a mathematical **inevitability**) then there's no longer much motivation to operate the blockchain, then **your "world's best immutable database" ceases to exist.**

Bitcoin is close to it's all time high. But the halving just happened and even though it reached all time high past cycles over the last 15 years after the halving. The price goes back to the all time high and does an increase in multiples. What the multiple this time will be is anyone's guess. ..Me personally I think it goes between 140-200k ..So that is a 2-3x the last cycles all time high..69k X 2-3..Those multiples are lower than other cycles. Cause there seems to be diminishing returns. ..If you take the averages of what has happened after 18months after the halving in the last 2 cycles it has gone up by like 18x and I think the last cycle it went up by 7.8X ...The average of those 2 puts it around 500k to 1 million 18months after the halving. I think it will be much lower 140k-200k to be honest... Either way bitcoins isn't going anywhere. If U do buy be ready to hold ur position for 4 years if you can't do that and need the money earlier than rethink this through. The last thing U want to do is buy high and sell low. If it does drop after U buy just keep working and keep buying more until the next cycle. U HAVE TO!! wait until the next halving where the supply of new Bitcoins rewards gets reduced again. Which puts pressure on the price cause there is less on the market usually. And U can recover ur money and most likely a bunch of profits. ..The US government has approved the giant financial institutions to sell Bitcoin ETFS. they have an incentive to hire people to go out there and sell these new etfs cause they have service fees from managing it. So just an educated guess I think the price will go up over the next 10 years. ..As for ETH it usually follows Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes up so does ETH. ETH hasn't hit it's last all time high yet. ..The ETH ETF hasn't launched yet either. So I think it will increase by a bunch still. My estimate if Bitcoin gets to the lower range 140k or so. I think ETH goes to 8-10k maybe a bit more. ..Buying the ETH ETF is a bit weird cause if you buy real eth you can "stake" it and get between 3-4% in ETH so ur growing ur ETH amount. That was one of the things the SEC said the ETF companies can't do with ETH is stake it and do the payouts or keep the payouts. ..And it makes sense that they did that to be honest. When you stake your ETH you lock it up for a bit of time. ..If you don't know about ETH staking you should learn about it before U do anything like staking. Cause there are scammers out there. You have to do it with reputable services particularly decentralized ones. ..I think the most reputable one that is run by an actual company is Coinbase if I'm not mistaken. But they are centralised. I think a good decentralized one is called lido. ..You really gotta do research on this. But ya it's a way to grow the amount of eth you have by helping to secure the network. .And it's practically free. You can't do that with Bitcoin. ...If you want to take care of your own Bitcoin and eth then buy it yourself and self custody it. Buy in exchange and then take it out of the exchange to your crypto cold storage wallet Learn about that process. ..If you don't want that responsibility then the ETF works fine but ur gonna pay management fees. It also goes against the ethos of crypto where you don't need anyone to hold your money for U. U take care if yourself. But U gotta be careful don't lose the keys don't use random software that can steal it. Get a cold storage wallet. You gotta do research bro. ..If U wanna buy some and be responsible for it ur self before setting up cold wallet and before the price goes up like crazy then use a reputable exchange. Like Coinbase. Those guys aren't going anywhere and have never scammed anyone. As a matter of fact Coinbase hold the Bitcoins that the ETF companies buy lol. That's how much these guys are trusted. ..Good luck and welcome to crypto. It will definitely change ur life if ur smart and patient about it :)

>A log file with cryptographic signing that is posted to multiple places is probably more reliable. ..Ooohhh, yeah, I hadn't thought of that. Like, I guess if you had encrypted information distributed in multiple places like some kind of distributed ledger that would be fuckin reliable. ..Shit. Got me there...No one is inherently trustworthy. There are only incentives and systems. Say I kept my log with 3 corporations. What prevents them from changing it? Sure... Maybe legal troubles if they get caught, but how would they get caught? It's your word against theirs, unless.... Unless they don't all change. They're caught off there isn't consensus. Blockchain validators have a strong financial incentive to be in consensus. Congrats. You now finally understand literally the very first thing about blockchain. Just now. For the first time...But on tokenization, it absolutely does not require that the line keeps going up. It only requires that the token has value. The block chain requires validation, and that validation is incentivized with rewards. There's absolutely no requirement that those rewards increase over time. You just misunderstood Dan Olson, who unfortunately misunderstands blockchain. I was subscribed to folding ideas long before that video though, so I can deal with a few undercooked takes...The speculative value of cryptocurrency depends on growth. Just as the speculative value of Tesla or Apple, or Nvidia, or Ford, or AT&T or Gold depend on the line going up. That speculative value is the main draw for investors now, though staking in ether effectively creates a dividend which replaces some of that. But even now, the value in blockchain isn't purely speculative...Here's one thing his video misses. You, also, in an emotional sense, have a position. If you have chosen not to invest in cryptocurrency, that's a position. You succeed relative to your peers (capitalism is inherently competitive) if cryptocurrency fails. You fail relative to your peers if cryptocurrency succeeds. If you're honest with yourself, you must see this reality...I also have a position. I bought my first ether at $12. I'm considering selling soon to purchase a house outright. That doesn't mean I'm right and you're wrong. But it does mean that if someone in this conversation would be seeking vindication for their opinion, it wouldn't be me...And what else? Quite the gish gallop you dropped. ..The Oracle problem is only a program in a subset of problems. For example, it's not a problem I'm the use cases I already have in my last comment. ..Proving that a video hasn't been manipulated since a given datetime is completely useful, for say, dashcams. ..We know when the crash occurred. We know the video hasn't been edited since then if it was hashed to the block chain. The only other possibility is that the video was fabricated before the crash, which just really wouldn't apply in nearly all traffic incidents. This might not seem important to you now, but AI video is still improving at a breakneck pace. ..No Oracle problem. See? ..Maybe you should approach this topic with more curiosity.

Is there an eta when ethereum ETF will be available to purchase?

What are they going to do, ban the internet?

What's a flip e pening?

Banning BTC would be terrible for ETH adoption. We're all in this together.

They won’t do this since the us gov is a top 10 BTC holder

Great response, however, I think it is in vain. Dude has a clear lack of understanding.
2
Nope no ETA yet, they approved it but still need to do the full paperwork for it to be made available. They haven't said when but within the next 6 months to a year most likely.  my guess cause it will be an election token the Democrats will play with. ..Biden will push it through to say he is also crypto friendly. But you don't want to play that card too early. So my educated guess is that it will go through closer to elections in the US. ..If ur interested in buying eth you don't want to wait until it's fully approved/processed to buy some. If it behaves like Bitcoin it will go up before the launch then it will launch and the price will go down. Buy the rumor sell the news type of play. Then it will recover after that dip etc etc etc.
2
They can raise taxes on bitcoin and other proof of work shit coins that waste the planets resources. Meanwhile coins like ETH can have lower taxes

Flippening = Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin's market cap

Maybe for like a day. Then ETH would take it's well deserved number 1 spot. But I think ETH can get to number one even without BTC ban. BTC is ancient useless technology.

If my government did this, I’d surely leave. Also highly unlikely “wasting resources” would be the reason, as governments are good at doing that already without POW. Bitcoin and Eth will exist and thrive side by side for decades to come. Maxi mentality is silly 🤪

😂😂 okkayyyyyy Mr. Software engineer who started in the early ‘80s. That’s hilarious. 🤣 ..People of Reddit amaze me sometimes.

All it takes is 1 more slightly hotter heat wave in Europe and EU can ban/tax the hell out of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an ancient dinosaur. There is no need - whatsoever - for any cryptocurrency to suck up so much energy. It's just a useless factor. History showed that useless technology will always age and get forgotten. It's only a matter of time. Bitcoin has to upgrade to POS or something similar where energy is not required or it will die (i.e. it will lose it's number 1 place in crypto market cap, then lose top 10, then top 100 etc). I don't buy a bitcoin for the same reason I wouldn't buy horses and carriages to get around town or travel further away. If you love BTC then you should sell your car and buy some horses and a carriage.

So you admit you are the one who isn't qualified to be telling people about this technology?

Wow. Happy for you. Sincerely.

Congratulations on getting it back. Whatever you don't sell, I do recommend staking some so you'll get the amount you sold back over time, like 16k is a lot and I don't blame you for selling some, but putting some aside and letting it grow while letting it compound over time will probably be a good idea during these times. But like I said, though, you don't have to stake a lot, but it's just an option
1
Just HODL Until it goes to 10-15K and don't lose them for real

The password is completely unimportant as long as you have the 12/24 word secret phrase. You can just as easily use another wallet or wipe the existing metamask wallet and re-import your wallet with the secret phrase.

Research high interest bank accounts/CDs. At 4.5-5%+, just think of it as a more lucrative and liquid form of staking. Congrats~

Yeah you could cash out, or….. you could let it ride 😎

Your gonna sell right now??? I'd at least hold until April.

Can I suggest an alternative? .Put it in Aave (preferably as rETH or some liquid staking token that accrues interest), and withdraw USDC or DAI as debt, then spend that. Now you have almost 5 ETH in savings and the same spending cash.
