These kind of ideas are what drive all crypto subreddits. If you take a look into each crypto subreddit there is you might get the idea that mostly young people are drawn to it with the idea of becoming rich over night and feel absolutely great about themselves when the price goes up like they did something right. ..Discord servers of the respective currency are even worse...That does not mean that cryptocurrencies are a bad investment. ..Personally I think the technology evolving into cloud computing and data management especially holds great potential as transactions of any kind can never be manipulated.
5
You make your trades based on what reddit says and people trust you with their money.  What a wild world.
4
Since you are an accountant, my words might sound childish. Anyway putting my 2 cents, correct me if I'm wrong. ..I support your 2nd point the high price after the halving is bit of a hype and a lot of logic. If we look into the demand and assume it to be constant after the halving it automatically should go up because miners will be paid less for more work so their interest will go low. And at this very point the scarcity plays an important role. Low production high demand. Again once we hit about 85-90% of the total minable amount that would create another scarcity because mining gets tougher with time and the rewards go low. Technically, that 21 millionth BTC will never be mined. ..Now coming to the market, currently crypto still in a juvenile phase of acceptance. The market is highly controlled by whales and they legally don't come under any laws of blockchains that they can't hold more than X amount or sell more than Y amount. As a result their decision impacts the market a lot, specially the price of altcoins...Currently we are also facing a lot of obstructions from the govts. for a several reasons and at the same time many govts are utilising it...In order to conclude, I would say if we zoom out the crypto market graph we will get a growth as a whole, particularly if we focus on coins like BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL etc. Basically it's a long term investment and we need to keep an eye on the coins to avoid predictable huge losses.
1
> I‚Äôm an accountant at an insurance firm ..Stopped there - best of luck lmao
1
So you've based an entire financial decision and sold everything, based on some comments from some Redditors you read, on a maximalist sub that mainly cares about the price, rather than from a tech sub, and where most people probably haven't read up on the adoption development and much less on how blockchain works? And you even said that these people don't even seem to know about macroeconomics...And you preferred that over any real on-chain data, any of the growing real world utility, and the data from growing use for businesses. ..That might be the equivalent of going to Wallstreetbets, and selling all your shares of NVIDIA a year ago, because you saw too many people lacking any basic understanding of macroeconomics on there, while they were all shilling NVIDIA because their argument was that "stonks go up"...That sounds like the investment reasoning that would make you a great asset for Cathie Wood at Ark Invest.

good u should leave, lol. It's not for the faint of heart. I've said it for a decade now the liquidity or the \*worth of bitcoin has been pumped out, and it into the hands of speculators and alt coins. But u fail to grasp a few things...1) It is scarce, doesn't mean no one want it. Ask people around if they want donations, people will take all your bitcoins for \*free\* if u want lol. Bitcoin will continue to have value so as long as 2 people trade it deems it has value. Try asking for 1 bitcoin, or leftover wallets, you will never find out or get one lol...2) Halving takes like 2-3 years to reflect on prices if you look at history...  .If bitcoin was still at 20-40K would u still left or would u had hold if u it was 80-100K right now? You have to take bitcoin with it warts and all, the market manipulation, the big powers keeping it artificially low, how miners are mining at a loss etc... If you are expecting lambos and yachts, boy u in the wrong crowd. Go make $$$ trading altcoins when they do 20-40% overnight lol. Or go do that forex manager scam lol...  .The coin has inherent value due to it used electricity and computing to mine, as compared to fiat currency like tron/USD/ripple. You are not part of the "movement" so u can leave. no one cares. I bet u didn't even read the "bitcoin obituary" it's 400+ and counting now.....So you put over $1200, look how much u gone now? Do you feel scammed? glad u didn't buy at the top of the crash of 2020 or the crash of 2017.

Title:  How much programming skill is necessary to trade? 
38
To answer from a slightly different angle, for longer term,less time-sensitive or mathematically/statistically based strategies you could learn python pretty easily...The closer you edge toward "every millisecond > microsecond > nanosecond matters" the more skill you're going to require in languages "closer to the metal".
5
Having programming skills can definitely give you an edge in cryptocurrency trading, especially when it comes to developing trading bots or analyzing data. However, it's not a requirement to be successful. Many traders rely on technical analysis, market research, and gut instincts rather than coding. It really depends on your trading style and strategy. If you enjoy programming, it can be a fun way to enhance your trading experience, but it's not a must-have skill to get started and see profits in the crypto market. What's your take on this?

2-3 years late bro. I think there were algo bots 2-3 years ago with bybit and other websites. Due to regulations, many have gone out of US soil. So yea, so unless u can program with the trading API, and have your script/bot look at screeners etc.. you're like reinventing the wheel. I did my experiment 2-3 years ago with the bots, they are dumb as rocks and use micro-trading to amass wealth. Eventually u just become a "fee extractor". sure u make money but when u do you taxes, your accountant/tax man would be like, "WTF just HLOD" already. ..The problem with bots is they don't look back at history, they don't have a 'tier' system they look at their just look at certain coins and prices and trade like a blind trader. One of they funny memes was the "**holding bags"**, aka holding rare/untradeble tokens due to market changes...With house trading fees, AI bot (subscriptions), capitial gains tax, your better off just swing/long term trading...Look at bybit I remember they used to have 3commas, or bot trading competition on the best AI crypto bot trading. so yea you're not the one smart guy with glasses.

I think you wrote a watery text. ..If you look at it in general, the development of mankind all its existence is on the path of simplification, and you don't even have to agree with it, it's a fact. ..As far as technical analysis is concerned, it is the most obvious example of the possibility to "simplify" anything. ..automatic programs on the basis of code, analyze and give you already formatted data, so that you, my dear ones, do not get dirty and do not spoil your eyesight by looking at charts and trying to select the indicator you need, and God forgive me if I remember it candlestick patterns...imho, programming and coding is one of the components of any person's strategy.

Title: How do you DCA in crypto? Share your strategies
1
I chart what I wanna accumulate and set limit buy orders at strong support levels. ..Like BTC for example, I would have a bigger buy oder at the 60k level (seen from the daily/ weekly chart). That's the strongest support area and I just "save money" and pool it into this order...There are tons of different ways. Some exchanges let you place recurring orders like every 5th of a month buy $5 worth of whatever. .That's ok too! ..My orders just take longer to fill but they will eventually. ..When DCA'ing into crypto you need to do it for the long run! And don't give a crap on volatility. .Look at it in 5yrs time and laugh about it...Just because price is down doesn't mean it's over. Just because price is up doesn't mean it's the moon shot or never will return to lower prices.
3
Easy peasy lemon squeezy. DCA means: Selling or buying the same amount of USD over constant time intervals...I've tested it on historical data and it doesn't matter which day or if you do it monthly or weekly...There's no way to tell when to start or stop DCAing, because nobody can predict future prices.
1
Thanks, very similar to how I manage my portfolio
1
nope, there are different DCA strategies: "lower low" when instrument is dropping and you buy every new bottom, then calendar-based - its a classic. some use others like buy-when-rsi-oversold etc

5
My strategy remains DCAing into my favorite projects: BTC, ETH, LINK, ZETA, and PICA (cross-chain interoperability and restaking protocol on Solana). It has always worked great for me over my 4 years in the crypto space.
1
My strategy involves periodic DCA while actively seeking whitelist opportunities for promising upcoming projects. Currently, I'm accumulating points using the pinging app in preparation for AUKI's upcoming TGE.
1
Most don‚Äôt need a strat. They add and DCA. If you want a strat X you better start learning TA and when and where to buy and sell...It‚Äôs always best to DCA into positions , but at major support levels ...Removing emotions is whole other skill set
1
DCA and HODL. That's my strategy. Until I see significant gains, I am not going out. I am restaking on Picasso Network, that can be a good option for your SOL bag. When I am doing that, I am not that much worried about the market situation.
1
My strategy is to just hodl and wait for the market to drop beyond FOMO price range so I can start to DCA again. But if SUPRA has its TGE any time soon, I'm buying.
1
Buy the dips, sell the rips.

Yeah, TradingView rocks, but the constant increase in their pricing is getting annoying. Let's see what offer they'll give on the upcoming Black Friday - I have premium, expecting them to bump it up by 20-30 percent more than last year.
1
Thanks for the info! Never heard of them before. What makes them interesting to you? What do you like most about them?
1
Yeah, I agree. Plus now that they lowered premium benefits because of the new professional categories

Title: Guys I'm a complete nooby, I want to start crypto currency, not sure which to start with

Buy only Bitcoin. Watch the market and learn about altcoins, then slowly start buying them based on how much their value can grow in the future, start with established large caps like ETH, EOS, ATOM, etc. Don't be in a hurry to jump into any lowcap. The truth is lowcaps will give you the highest gains but they can quickly drain you of all your liquidity and you join the "crypto is bad" gang.

I'm really interested in learning about crypto but I don't know how to start and what do I need you know. Also I saw on tik tok people are saying ai dog is really good investment for the future so I don't know much but want to start at same time. Also if I have $100 where should I put them now, and which website should I buy.btc and eth from for canadian and which one is safe. Cuz honestly I know zero things about crypto but I want to start small
1
Be very careful out there. There's no place more infested with scammers than this space, I think. Start with basic YT videos I guess, something like "What exactly is cypto trading and how can I start?" And then if there are pple you know irl who you can ask for guidance and other stuff. ..Goodluck on your journey.
2
Just take it one step at a time to fully understand the exchanges supported in your country etc. Don't rush into it.

Here is an alternative way. Oasis and illumineX have ensured that crypto onboarding is simplified and seamless and need not depend on either any CEX or even Paypal. First, thanks to the [Oasis-Transak](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/transak-onboarding-simplification) partnership, users can buy Oasis native tokens Rose with native fiat currency directly from the [Oasis web wallet](https://wallet.oasis.io/). These tokens can be transferred easily to Metamask on the Oasis Sapphire chain through paratime transfer. Next, perform a cross-chain swap on the multichain confidential DEX, [illumineX](https://ix.exchange) the, and get Eth tokens or any other EVM tokens.

Unfortunately it seems like these platforms only offer futures derivatives. I asked in the support chats and while I haven't been able to chat with anyone - cause I'm not a registered user I guess - it looks like indeed they don't offer option derivatives...Did I miss something?
2
Oh I don‚Äôt know that I ever see traditional options anywhere really. I think coinbase might have them?

Most large CEXes have them. The problem is that the ones I tried don't offer options in my jurisdiction: that's the point of my post to start with...Why mods deleted your comments?

I‚Äôm not sure I can‚Äôt even see what I said. Anyways, check out rns.id as an alternative for being able to access those exchanges. Takes about 3-4 weeks but worth it. Obviously do some due diligence first make sure the program is still running smoothly. If I recall the cost is about 150 or 250 for a year. I ran it by my family attorney and he said it‚Äôs legitimate for now but the US policies can change quick so keep that in mind

One Example: Bob has 1 BTC but no $..Bob needs $ to pay for his only Fans subscription..Bob doesnt want to sell his BTC because he thinks BTC will rise..So Bob deposit his BTC and takes out a $ loan to pay for his Only Fans subscription..When Bob gets his salary he deposit $ back to the lending Platform and withdrawals his BTC.
2
what are you talking about. can borrow like 3-5x on most platforms. and then futures are 10-100x, perpetuals w.e.
0
Damn crazy analogy
1
You talking about leverage trading, up to 200X on perpetuals BTW..While OP talking about taking a loan that he can spend on what ever he wants, while using Bitcoin as collateral..But it's easy OP people do it because they want to save their BTC hoping for a major increase and not paying as much in interest.
2
Lol yea 3 to 5 on collateralized loans where I would. Pretty sure. 2x at the low low. He must be only looking at dex where funds aren't locked onto platform during the loan. Ofc those be less than 1 to 1. And best use case for those is doing it to double up a long on something. Deposit 100k usdt borrow 80k btc swap
1
Yes OP talking about a loan, which isn't locked obviously!.You don't trade with your loan, you can just use your funds as collateral in a leverage position on a platform otherwise.
1
Kucoin used to do those loans locked to platform tho. Think few others still do too
1
Sure that is a easy fix, many platform probably have that but it's not what OP is talking about, but a regular loan like bank loan but you use crypto as collateral!..Was thinking about 100X long when the bull run starts but Bitcoin only need to drop 1% to lose all your BTC but they probably liquidat your position around 0.5% haha..I'm still thinking on a 10X long during the bull market  though.
1
yea yea. understood. and you don't start as 100x long. how u make that play. is with a 5-8x leverage to start. and as its profiting. you increase leverage and the size. piece at a time. thats. how you end up doing like 60x riding a huge long. and it definitely can work. easily if you've been watching how its moving. can get that bottom within like 3% ish  .thats actually true value in platforms that offer crazy 200x 500x leverage. not for the initial. but to really ramp it up after your already green.
1
500X is crazy, but might try it for fun with a very small amount, never heard of it, but I'm sure I can find some Bahamas registered CEX etc that offer that kind of leverage without any requirements..I have used 3X before and now I understand it more with interest rates, volatility decay etc!
1
yea yea. im just saying. you start with that 3-8x. and only add money/leverage to it. as your profiting. you wanna ride a long from what you think is the super low point for a week or more. this is the way. like thats how start a trade that ends up massive with very little risk. if your wrong. and the bottom is lower. close out partial/all of it. and find a new entrance. OR AT LEAST. do not add anything to it catching knives down.  .attempting an entrance at 17x + leverage. is pretty much diving headfirst into a wall for most people. or will end up that within a few trades even if your first one does get lucky.

Bitcoin or etheruem are the lowest risks.  Anything else in top 10 or 30 are medium risk. The rest is high risk
2
I suggest considering an investment in QANX and holding onto it until next year, especially during the peak of the bull market. The project is at the forefront of the quantum resistance blockchain narrative which will experience significant growth.
2
It's called diversification. You're going to want to pick two hundred random coins and buy one dollar of each. Foolproof ..Really it just depends on where you sit on the risk curve. If you want the possibility of striking it big while most likely throwing your money away, it's really just whatever gamble makes you happy. If you would like substantial gains and are willing to sit in red at times while you stomach that volatility, Bitcoin is probably what you're looking for. If you are looking for a safe return that steadily grows without substantial drops, crypto probably isn't where you should be looking.

Celestia (TIA) is my favorite, modular data availabilty network, it's the future since mobile validators will then can become part of any blockchain. If they can develop into a mass adoption stage that you can use your daily phone as light node/validator for any "moduled" blockchain then it's a game changer. Million of nodes is a fucking decentralized blockchain model everyone hope for, and also solving problem for big data issue for any blockchain after years of operation.

I think RNDR is the best
1
$btc $eth are good long term hold. ..Any established network coin $Cro $sol $Ada are a couple. ..Or if you believe in a particular CEX you could go with their coin. $BNB $CRO $BASE
1
If the Litecoin is your favourite I suppose that you already have some in your wallet. But my pov is that even if LTC manage to hit the ATH you will get 4-5x from this point on. I'd spend that $200 on something else rather than LTC...For the future, LTC should be a good hodl, don't get me wrong, but I choose to invest in some upcoming projects and new technologies like BRC20 for example. With this recent ordinals hype I think there will be a bunch of projects to choose from. Memes are also a good way to make some easy money and Base chain looks interesting to me since there are many meme coins emerging there like ROCK and DEGEN for example. We witnessed how much some people made by investing in memes...I am familiar with the fact that some investors are not that into memes because their lack of tech but really don't care for that if they can go 20x, 30x, 50x or more.

These picks are solid. With the rise of DePIN and AI gaining momentum in the industry, I'm all in. Posemesh is one of the projects I'm currently bullish on, alongside Stobox.

Title: Trading/Scalping crypto pairs.
2
It interests me. I've always traded (but no scalping) with one of the pair being a stablecoin..I can see opportunities at trading non-stable pairs...Care to share your experience and conclusions?..Are non-stable pairs futures a thing CEXes and DEXes normally offer?
2
i'm not too sure on futures, I don't have access to trade those right now on CB, and after seeing big risk i kind of stayed away lol...I'm totally inexperienced, I have only traded the USD pairs with a slight edge but that's about it, def have had my share of losses...So far trading SOL-ETH has been good, mainly because ETH had been bleeding against SOL which made it a nice upwards trending market...I think if the goal is to increase your crypto holdings, it is a great way to do it, as it's not about how many gains in tendies, but how much crypto can I gain itself, so it's like a double investment imo...I found myself also constantly looking at the individual asset charts, trying to figure out the moves they will individually make so i can somewhat guess a move that the pairs would make. Hoping to keep the good luck streak up!..&#x200B;..Also, the ADA-ETH pair is mega slow, so i'm thinking it's because there is barely any volume/volatility on those pairs, but a small move is actually great. I got a few ADA when it was about 0.000187 ETH and sold around 0.000189, which doesn't seem like much, but it was profit regardless, but it took forever just to move 0.000001 up/down.
2
Perpetual futures should be flexible and a good hedge to avoid the risk of losing from both the tokens in the pair in case they both crash. At least I guess... the contract should be priced in a stablecoin and you should earn the difference whether you're long or short. But it could also be settled in one of the tokens which doesn't sound good IMHO. I'll give a look at that...Clearly the "stabled" pairs are more liquid but there should be almost no arbitrage chances given the very "quant" nature of these assets. Someone should immediately step in in case there is a spread that can be monetized...If a pair is "slow" it should mean that the 2 tokens are almost perfectly correlated...Careful about the positive trend on the SOL/ETH pair: look at the history and see for yourself that the last week isn't the "rule".

91
Peter Schiff has to be the greatest marketing genius the world has ever seen. His gains from playing the ‚ÄúBitcoin critic‚Äù are probably greater than had he went all in on Bitcoin in 2012.
2
Lmfao, so would everyone else. The man probably gets high off his own farts.
2
Never listen to someone who has no skin in the game
2
I‚Äôm sure I would too. I don‚Äôt think my hands are that diamond. Had I bought in 2010, I woulda happily sold that long ago. I understand it better now and will hodl for long term
2
Oh you would have sold at ATH.  You must be a f‚Äôing genius to have come up with that idea.
2
He's just too bearish to make decent money. He's been bearish for at least 20 years and was right about 20% of the time.
2
Yeh hold for 14 years, accumulating almost two decades of experience with BTC including what happens at halving‚Ä¶.. only to sell right before what would have been his 4th halving event if he‚Äôd held. Suuuuuuure
2
With respect to him, he has a gold company.  He's not going to back crypto. ..Many potential gold customers are now Bitcoin investors.
1
Btc critics don't understand btc that's why they are opposed.
1
And if my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bike.
1
Ah yes, the Bitcoin critic. A highly sought after profession right now‚Ä¶
1
Why would anyone care what this person has to say
1
Stop fucking talking about Peter Schiff or Cathie Woods. They shouldn‚Äôt matter to anybody.
1
Holy fuck no shit Sherlock. Fucking genius
1
Wow this is groundbreaking what an incredible realization. ..Too bad he didn‚Äôt buy any and he‚Äôs a fool!
1
lol this guy would have sold almost immediately for a loss- he‚Äôs been telling people to do for the whole time, costing anyone who listened to him potentially millions of dollars at this point (and climbing)¬†
1
How is his opinion even relevant? ‚ÄúI failed to buy in 2010, but let me give you this advice now‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Dude. You didn‚Äôt buy when you should have. Stfu.
1
At the bottom of that article it shows him shilling his ordinals, which is nft on bitcoin (backing a crypto).
2
Ah, the classic 'you just don't get it' cope
2
I feel not many people know this quote but I love you for it
1
It really would be nice to never hear this doofus‚Äôs name again lol
1
Even though I've been wrong several times over the last 14 years let me tell you what is he proper way to do things with my grand expertise!
1
This guy has been be best predictor of the bottoms.  What this means is, as unlikely as it looks now, this is probably the last time to get into BTC under previous ATH price.
1
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a recent quote? Been seeing it everywhere the last couple days.

Leverage doesnt matter. The only thing that matters is position size. If you reopen the position with lower leverage but higher margin, and the size is the same as if you would use less margin but 60x leverage, then there is literally no difference.

Hoge is my memecoin fr, but she's at 13m mkcap..There's a million reasons but I'd have to say dyor. They have a phat treasury, snapshot votes about what to do with it, and lots of things in the pipeline.
2
I completely agree with the subjective theory of value. Which grounds the fact that even the most useless/trash/etc thing in the right circumstances can gain huge value...But let's be honest: memecoins aren't successful because they do..>have a phat treasury, snapshot votes about what to do with it, and lots of things in the pipeline...In web3 (and in the "traditional" economy) there are incredibly sophisticated new technologies and market applications that no one cares about and that fail, while some silly memecoins reach hundreds of Ms of MC...Maybe today if you want to create a successful memecoin those you mentioned are necessary conditions to even be considered, but far from an explanation...The best explanation IMHO is probably instead that we don't know exactly why some are successful, but that good marketing, financial conditions and luck play a great role. In many regards I liken it to a beauty contest: very subjective stuff...Thanks for the feedback but actually I was looking for technical analysis/global macro related ideas, more than fundamental valuation ones...PS: with 13M$ MC (and probably even way higher) and low volumes I guess the investors wholly depend on the creator's whims about when to pump or dump. Investing in that case becomes mind reading. Good luck.

Do you have any news on this? I'm trying to google about it and this is literally the only thing that shows up. Also I see that there are supposed to be more comments on this post but I can't see any of them, is it just me?

nothing happened yet, i didn‚Äòt receive anything but didn‚Äòt get my account wiped either so it probably was just a joke or something‚Ä¶ be careful however, they could still dump some infected tokens in your account

After some more digging I think it might be real?? But oh well it's too late now lol

Just additional reminders:..1.	‚Å†Monero fair price after all large centralised entities will go away, should be some $1500:..https://moneroj.net/metcalfeusd/..2. Till year 2040, total coin supply of Monero will be slightly under total supply of Bitcoin, despite tiny tail emission...3. You can exchange Monero to/from other coins at various services and by various methods listed at the following two anti-KYC aggregators:..https://trocador.app..https://kycnot.me
2
Monero is turning into an outcast. I believe it will grow larger as this happens turning into a completely alternative currency.
2
>Monero is turning into an outcast. I believe it will grow larger as this happens turning into a completely alternative currency...I agree. It was a drop based on news, we could say, and not a problem related to its fundamentals. I believe it will recover from this drop soon.
2
I agree with you. The FUD always kicks in hard, but when there's intrinsic value behind a project - as IMO is the case for Monero, the price always recover.

Bitcoin is world wide KYC censored scam nowadays. It becomes completely anti-crypto in depth. Dirty coins can infect clean ones right during normal trading process over a blockchain. And various authorities can ban that dirty coins (even partially dirty, just 1% dirty) and prevent you from exchange them to fiat or something else...In no way Bitcoin behaves like Gold...What is behaves exactly like 100% fungible and indistinguishable Gold atoms backed by quantum mechanics is Monero. And Monero blockchain behaves like chemical substance called Aqua Regia. Monero coins can be dissolved and restored from the blockchain - aqua regia - and Monero atoms - coins - are always clean like pieces of Gold metal in real world. And till year 2040, total coin supply of Monero remains less than total supply of Bitcoin despite tiny tail emission designed to keep transaction fees ultimately low at 0.00005XMR...KYC approach in traditional finances is not a completely bad or good thing. One can register say at Interactive Brokers and trade traditional bonds and assets like Apple, NVidia, US treasures, etc. Furthermore, state jurisdiction protects your funds...But Bitcoin is entirely another thing. If you use it as a cryptocurrency, without custodial wallets, and bypassing state authorities, all your Bitcoins will be banned for sure one day. You can still see them at your wallet, but never can exchange it. Jurisdictions don‚Äôt protect you...If you use Bitcoin on custodial wallet of centralised exchanges and even passed KYC verification, your account or entire exchange can be hacked and nobody return you Bitcoin in foreseen future. Just google for MTGOX case. And, Bitcoin that doesn‚Äôt leave custodial wallets of centralised exchanges is not Bitcoin at all...Thus, Bitcoin with total KYC censorship established over its blockchain has no sense and has no value at all. You have to switch to traditional financial assets or migrate to Monero.

Its manipulation and planned. ..Plus I heard Grayscale is selling billions of dollars of crypto this week. Dont know if the news article is correct or not tho...Dips are for buying! Most of crypto is on sale...Im not worried, itll go back up.
5
I read that Grayscale had sold off a ton of their GBTC, which is contributing to the downturn. Nothing to be concerned about.

dip before the rip

Normal market dip after long bullrun.

Yall werent looking at 32k??? From the announcement??? He'll maybe 28...
3
Are people really bugging out over a 5% drop? I‚Äôve been waiting for it to bounce back down
3
Bitcoin is fun. It goes up a little ‚ÄúOMG PUMPPPPPPPPP BABY!!!! THIS THING IS GOING TO $100k SOON!!!‚Äù..Small dip and it‚Äôs always some massive conspiracy theory about why it even went down 1 Penny.
3
What kind of impact can we expect from the Bitcoin ETF?
2
[effac√©]
2
I read an article stating that FTX is unloading $1 Billion worth of Greyscale Bitcoin Trust. Not sure how much truth is behind it, but timing makes sense.
2
Carpenoctom says it's driven by GBTC outflows, since many of the new ETF products have preferable fee structures, so many people will be moving their money out of GBTC and into more affordable products
2
FTX dumped $1B on the market when the ETFs launched, probably to take advantage of the sudden buy pressure...It is incorrect to imply the ETF manager doesn‚Äôt buy and sell the underlying asset.  They are required to buy and sell actual crypto to track the spot as closely as possible.
2
Oh no it went down 12%‚Ä¶.. just hit the buy button and stfu. lol seriously when did we start panicking over swings this small?
2
Buy the rumor, sell the news. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2
Maybe BTC is now a Sh\*tcoin and the alts are the future.  I don't really believe that, but iit could evolve that way.
2
Everyone should've known the big boys play by their book...ETF run-up *buy the rumor*..ETF day *sell the news*..ETF  a week after investors order placed  *Buy the dip*..*Profit*
2
Monero just seems not to have the adoption and how are you able to validate total supply? Like if I had better answers I‚Äôd happily use it but so far it just seems like a huge risk that I rather not have to worry about
2
Get some sleep and good bro
2
A lot of old goons who on the fringe had their money managers pull their bitcoin and reinvest in the ETF‚Äôs it‚Äôs a safer bet...Don‚Äôt worry the halving will put us at $70,000 or more...I wonder what will happen when the last bitcoin is mined. That‚Äôs the real question.
2
In no other market or asset class would any rational analyst call what is happening right now a panic sale. Something like 80% of long term holders are still in profit.
2
It was low for 2 years then you came within the last month bought while it was high and now asking yourself "what happened"
2
The reason for the dip is massive GBTC and FTX selling. It‚Äôs well documented. And very temporary.
2
Who sells when there is blood in the market.
2
Buy, bitches!
2
Kids, what we are witnessing is a great phenomenon in the financial industry known as ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù. Literally a textbook incident. Huge rally pre etf which caused the price to pump. Then real traders that actually know what they are doing sell once breaking news happens and all eyes are on the asset. ..Which then causes major shareholders, or crypto investors in this case, to sell off en masse once the news happens. They bought at $30-40k and were happy with a profit selling at $45k. ..Now that crypto is dropping, all the Steven‚Äôs who thought they were going to 10x overnight are panic selling for a loss because they used next months rent money to try and make a quick Buck, only for the bulls to buy their panic sells at a lower price than they sold for.
2

These comments are so cringe. All conspiracy theory. There are well documented trades is GBTC and FTX selling. You‚Äôve got to do some of your own research. ..It‚Äôs also been like two weeks. ETF take us to the moon argument‚Ä¶.you thought we‚Äôd hit 100k 2 weeks after announcement? Zoom out. The way up to 40k ppl are partying. We correct and dip back down for a retest and it‚Äôs doom and gloom conspiracy?

Who's paying for this post? Look at the body of the post and then OPs responses in the post. You got multiple novels written within the comment section with links and data. Whats the play here exactly? Foment hate for the ETF? Or fear that bitcoin is now going to 0 because of the etf? You seem very prepared and coordinated.

I warned of this long ago, when you look at the macro and understand the threat that crypto is to the status quo of control over the people, you can better grasp how & why they will co-op it to eliminate the threat.

‚ÄúStore of value‚Äù they said. 25% price lost just days after their ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù ETF approval by SEC...[Bitcoin price after ETF approval by SEC](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/s/ehQQ6pibo6)..After , sh@t , 2024-2009 = 15 years of Bitcoin on the market...Result : from cryptocurrency to hardly KYC censored volatile scam.
0
I'm beginning to lean heavily into the presumption BTC was created not by a sole individual but a small cabal with tentacles reaching into every aspect of our seemingly free reality. If BTC does have a malicious agenda behind it, we are all so f***ed when the rug is pulled. We will have already, unknowingly, herded ourselves into a line that's blindly following the next through the newly built construct of a one world government.

Panic sell?  $BTC is ON SALE. ..Don‚Äôt sell your $BTC to the ETFs. HODL strong üí™ Buy more!..People buying/selling ETF BTC are just leasing BlackRock BTC.  ..Any price pump/dip has already been realized when the ETF initially bought the BTC for the upcoming ETF. ..Unless the ETFs directly buy/sell BTC the etf should t have direct impact on BTC pricing.
1
Check hashrate. Relax. Study the asset and network. If it‚Äôs gambling for u, hit the booth and cash out. If it‚Äôs moving  hard money 1000 to 5000+ days into the future for you and your progeny, stand down and study what you own.
1
Sigh. You have to understand the principle of markets in that its a net zero game. Theres winners and losers on each end...The ETF is regulated (obviously). When trading ETFs guess who are the losers? The market makers. So they short BTC to off load front costs to enter the ETF onto the platform before they pump it up (also the publicly anticipated halving has every one and their grandma trying to time their entry at lower lows)..Timing or not its a long term buy for this next 3 year cycle.
1
First time?

I think the powers that be are, effectively, insider trading. Tinfoil, but I would not be surprised if certain people (who know a lot of stuff that‚Äôs expected to happen will actually happen) are influencing, if not orchestrating, media, influencers and events that might  cause a dip‚Ä¶then buy, right before they know the price will double.

Grayscales high fees happened while new etf‚Äôs fees are lower. People selling out of Grayscale. Hopefully a percentage of these accounts buy back in to other etf‚Äôs. If so, we‚Äôll see ath witnin 2024.

I am fully prepared to sue the short sellers
1
For people that don‚Äôt believe Bitcoin is valid, I would encourage you to check out any large online gambling site.  They mainly prefer Bitcoin transactions.  Now these are people that are solely in the business of making money.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they insist on dollars, pounds, or other fiat?  They just say ‚Äúwe prefer to be paid in something that may or may not be real?‚Äù  Please.  These are billions revenue global enterprises.  They‚Äôre not stupid.

BTC falls every year around this time. I believe it's tax selling.

Let it dip.... then buy some more. I feel sorry for the people who just bought at $45K.

Buy the dip

Manipulation for them to buy even more Bitcoin before it goes way up
1
ETFs were only thought of as a moon trigger by morons who don't understand what ETFs are...Will it make Bitcoin go up long-term? Absolutely. But everyone doesn't just convert their entire 401k to BTC ETFs overnight because there are now 11 ETFs. They could have been buying miners and grayscale this whole time in their 401ks anyway...All this did was take a step in the direction to legitimize crypto as an asset and not just a beanie babie. If 15 years of growth and millions of people believing in it wasn't enough proof... Soon enough, it will be 6 figures per bitcoin, and everyone will say "gotcha" when it falls back down to 40k, and it will be proof that it was a scam all along. And then it will go to half a million and back down to 200k, and everyone will scream "GOTCHA." I knew it was a scam all along...And we will keep doing this for a while.
1
Satoshi said, every single man should be his own bank, his own custody, his own compliance. Bitcoin blockchain should be free of censorship. ..15 years have passed...Today, people don‚Äôt own Bitcoin directly and its blockchain is under hard KYC censorship...100% directly opposite to Satoshi.
1
Why Grayscale is selling Bitcoins if they cried all 2020-23 right onto our ears ‚ÄúWe Buy and Hodl‚Äù? What value has Bitcoin if it is under hard KYC censorship? Apple makes iPhones, Tesla makes cars, what do Bitcoin miners make, if there is hard KYC censorship over Bitcoin blockchain?
-1
I don‚Äôt think so , because altcoins are falling in advance , relatively to Bitcoin.
1
Like Bitcoin Futures long lasting dip started in 2018 after long bullrun in 2017? It is obvious Trojan horse, your precious Bitcoin ETF. They never buy physical Bitcoin.

Almost 25% in just few days, and after whole 15 years Bitcoin is on the market, it is still extremely volatile and has no practical usage as a cryptocurrency due to hard KYC censorship over blockchain, terribly huge and unpredictable transaction fees and confirmation times...https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/3f5Uqpak-Unraveling-the-Intricacies-Behind-the-39K-Bitcoin-Dip/

I agree with you in all the statements, Bitcoin will grow, sure, but on basis of 10 years or so. ETF is a classic Trojan horse. In 2024, there will be only slight price falling or roughly constant. Guys here didn‚Äôt listen to me.

Maybe I am dumb, but why are those funds also declining if people are just moving their money, eg, IBIT?
2
And how Bitcoin price is relevant to? They are all traditional financial products nominated in dollars.

No they are not required, if we speak about Bitcoin ETF. This ETF (all of them) has a type ‚Äúwithout natural coin supply‚Äù. This condition was mandatory when SEC approved Bitcoin ETF...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-08/jpmorgan-traders-ripped-off-gold-market-for-years-jurors-told..Basically, they "buy and sell" Btc that they don't own. Someone wants to buy their ETF? Okay. They spend $100 to own $100 worth of their BTC etf. The ETF doesnt go "buy" the $100 worth. But they can invest the $100 until the owner of the $100 ETF tries to sell it... then they can buy it on the open market. $100 is just for a simplisitic breakdown. Most people buy and HODL their crypto, so the ETFs hope for this. Once a commodity like crypto is allowed to traded on an exchange, now it's possible for traders and institutional investors to buy/sell ETF shares they don't own either and even work with each other off the books to keep selling the ETF as a lost. "Hey buddy, im going to sell the ETF at a 1% loss today. Get out first before I do that.." "Okay pal, Ill sell mine for a loss too next week and give u a headsup" JP Morgan got caught doing this in the gold/silver market in 2022 and had to pay a fine (fire some bankers). The precious metals market is still heavily manipulated.

This too, of course, but main reason is absence of natural coin supply. It was a main SEC requirement before approval. The idea of regulators is to dump Bitcoin price to nearly zero, by manipulating ETF price...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-08/jpmorgan-traders-ripped-off-gold-market-for-years-jurors-told..Basically, they "buy and sell" Btc that they don't own.

Maybe crypto will die at all. Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency today due to hard KYC censorship that can end by white list of clean Bitcoins and prohibition of self-custody. Bitcoin can survive, but it becomes a perfect anti - crypto scam...What is cryptocurrency, Monero. It is designed from scratch to replace Bitcoin. Even its total coin supply will remain less than Bitcoin supply till year 2040. Will Monero survive? I don‚Äôt know. But we must fight for our fundamental human right of financial privacy and presumption of financial no-guilty. But Monero remains to be a cryptocurrency till win or death.

Right, just keep buying dips, amiwrong?
2
Didn‚Äôt you try to ask your questions in r/Monero? The community is friendly to newbies.
2
Why are the ETFs safer bets?  They don't care about the price of bitcoin.  They care about getting authorized agents to give them money
1
You're talking 100+ years in the future
1
Yeah, there were plenty of opportunities to buy around $20k not even a year ago. I'm kind of disappointed the lows aren't lower tbh. I could see it doubling from here at some point in the next couple years pretty easily, but I was hoping for more time at the $20k mark to leave more room for growth.
1
and a flux of bitcoin miners selling at higher prices to cover expenses. And the others wanting to make money off the fear. A typical week in crypto.

If it‚Äôs well documented, it‚Äôs priced in

Those with weak hands are the only ones getting shaken out, mate. This is merely another attempt to test the resolve of investors.

The halving is nigh
1
It definitely has been resembling the precious metals trading. Market opens ‚Ä¶. SLAM THE PRICE!
3
Even worse than precious metal. ETF makes Bitcoin  linked more to high tech assets rather than hedging instruments...I am in Crypto since 2009, the very beginning of Bitcoin birth. What the hell are you doing here, at point of view of the initial adopters...You do all exactly opposite than Satoshi dreamed of. Uncensored blockchain...Bitcoin ETF is exactly denial of being self custody, but cryptocurrency is essentially designed for every singe man to be his own bank...What the bell, guys?! Today, Bitcoin blockchain is fully censored by KYC authorities.
1
Yeah I was pissed when gold hit $0
2
Can you explain this mechanism??
1
Bitcoin has no value since KYC censorship. I expect new ATH will never be achieved. People recognise it and switch to either traditional financial instruments or Monero.
0
In no doubt, KYC authorities are playing to kill Bitcoin in eyes of median customer. Satoshi designed Bitcoin blockchain to be resistant to censorship. But today it is under hard KYC censorship. KYC authorities can‚Äôt interfere and ban transactions right on the blockchain but they can easily mark your Bitcoins dirty or even issue a white list of clean Bitcoins and declare all others are dirty. Instead of financial privacy, Bitcoin brings presumption of your guilty. You have to recognise Bitcoin it is not cryptocurrency anymore, regardless of whether price of this KYC scam will skyrocket. True Bitcoin today is Monero. Even its coin supply will remain less than Bitcoin supply till year 2040. No futures, no ETF, but there are a lot of decentralised exchanges, atomic swaps, and merchants accepting Monero directly, and prepaid cards...Imagine there's no heaven.It's easy if you try.No hell below us.Above us, only sky.Imagine all the people.Livin' for today.Ah.Imagine there's no countries.It isn't hard to do.Nothing to kill or die for.And no religion, too.Imagine all the people.Livin' life in peace.You.You may say I'm a dreamer.But I'm not the only one.I hope someday you'll join us.And the world will be as one‚Ä¶

yuuuuuup.
1
It‚Äôs up 10% on the month and 40% on the year. Tryna get a panic sell going to get a nice sale before halving?
1
I‚Äôve leaned this way, but this is what causes me to like BTC. The biggest whale holders don‚Äôt want to rug pull it until they get the whole world to accept it and like it so they can profit more. Even the elite know the dollar is shit and something needed to be done. If you study history, the big wigs rob the public of funds first through inflation (dollar) then deflation (asserts like land, precious medals, and Bitcoin/crypto). I‚Äôm confident Bitcoin will eventual hit 1 million per coin if not higher do to this. Either by around 2030 earliest or 2040 latest
1
What exactly are you envisioning when you are imagining this "rug pull" that would have any ramifications other than large financial loss within a relatively niche financial sector? And what "one world government" structure that people are "blindly following" exists within BTC? Without these specifics, your comment is very scary sounding, but doesn't actually say or describe anything whatsoever.
1
Huh?  It‚Äôs been known to not be truly anonymous for a long time.  That‚Äôs why ‚Äúprivacy coins‚Äù exist.
1
You forgot about the trustless, global, immutable reconciliation of transactions backed by the world's largest single-purpose computer network part.

I bought at 64k...But I've also bought at every single other price in-between from here to 3k.
1
Yeah. I kicked myself for not buying when it went under $18k in 2022. I‚Äôm also skeptical of the ETF and how hedge funds could manipulate the living hell out of it, but I keep hearing that Bitcoin could have a higher market cap than gold one day. I‚Äôm still in the fence on that, but Bitcoin‚Äôs already proven a lot so far. If it can pull a market cap like that, then you could see like a 16x gain on even this price one day...So anyway, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not buying‚Ä¶
1
LOL if you actually believe this. I‚Äôm sorry for you.

People should have the individual freedom to lose their life's work when they lose their laptop! Free market baby!

I own my bitcoin directly and most people here probably do too
2
Because People used the Price difference for arbitrage. Also People Shift from Grayscale etf to other ETFs with lower fee‚Äòs..Its all obvious. Numbers don‚Äôt always go up ser

Because they track the btc price. Are you new here?

Don't be a bed wetter. It's fine. I bought more today.

I bought a car using bitcoin. So it works as a digital payment medium like it‚Äôs supposed to. Also it‚Äôs 13% according to CoinGecko l. Up 73% the past year

Its manipulation and planned. ..Plus I heard Grayscale is selling billions of dollars of crypto this week. Dont know if the news article is correct or not tho...Dips are for buying! Most of crypto is on sale...Im not worried, itll go back up.

I read that Grayscale had sold off a ton of their GBTC, which is contributing to the downturn. Nothing to be concerned about.

dip before the rip

Normal market dip after long bullrun.

Yall werent looking at 32k??? From the announcement??? He'll maybe 28...

Are people really bugging out over a 5% drop? I‚Äôve been waiting for it to bounce back down

Bitcoin is fun. It goes up a little ‚ÄúOMG PUMPPPPPPPPP BABY!!!! THIS THING IS GOING TO $100k SOON!!!‚Äù..Small dip and it‚Äôs always some massive conspiracy theory about why it even went down 1 Penny.

What kind of impact can we expect from the Bitcoin ETF?
2
[effac√©]
2
I read an article stating that FTX is unloading $1 Billion worth of Greyscale Bitcoin Trust. Not sure how much truth is behind it, but timing makes sense.
2
Carpenoctom says it's driven by GBTC outflows, since many of the new ETF products have preferable fee structures, so many people will be moving their money out of GBTC and into more affordable products
2
FTX dumped $1B on the market when the ETFs launched, probably to take advantage of the sudden buy pressure...It is incorrect to imply the ETF manager doesn‚Äôt buy and sell the underlying asset.  They are required to buy and sell actual crypto to track the spot as closely as possible.
2
Oh no it went down 12%‚Ä¶.. just hit the buy button and stfu. lol seriously when did we start panicking over swings this small?
2
Buy the rumor, sell the news. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Maybe BTC is now a Sh\*tcoin and the alts are the future.  I don't really believe that, but iit could evolve that way.
2
Everyone should've known the big boys play by their book...ETF run-up *buy the rumor*..ETF day *sell the news*..ETF  a week after investors order placed  *Buy the dip*..*Profit*
2
Monero just seems not to have the adoption and how are you able to validate total supply? Like if I had better answers I‚Äôd happily use it but so far it just seems like a huge risk that I rather not have to worry about
2
Get some sleep and good bro
2
A lot of old goons who on the fringe had their money managers pull their bitcoin and reinvest in the ETF‚Äôs it‚Äôs a safer bet...Don‚Äôt worry the halving will put us at $70,000 or more...I wonder what will happen when the last bitcoin is mined. That‚Äôs the real question.
2
In no other market or asset class would any rational analyst call what is happening right now a panic sale. Something like 80% of long term holders are still in profit.
2
It was low for 2 years then you came within the last month bought while it was high and now asking yourself "what happened"
2
The reason for the dip is massive GBTC and FTX selling. It‚Äôs well documented. And very temporary.
2
Who sells when there is blood in the market.
2
Buy, bitches!
2
Kids, what we are witnessing is a great phenomenon in the financial industry known as ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù. Literally a textbook incident. Huge rally pre etf which caused the price to pump. Then real traders that actually know what they are doing sell once breaking news happens and all eyes are on the asset. ..Which then causes major shareholders, or crypto investors in this case, to sell off en masse once the news happens. They bought at $30-40k and were happy with a profit selling at $45k. ..Now that crypto is dropping, all the Steven‚Äôs who thought they were going to 10x overnight are panic selling for a loss because they used next months rent money to try and make a quick Buck, only for the bulls to buy their panic sells at a lower price than they sold for.
2
Panic posting about a minor Bitcoin dip in the year 2024 is wild lol.

These comments are so cringe. All conspiracy theory. There are well documented trades is GBTC and FTX selling. You‚Äôve got to do some of your own research. ..It‚Äôs also been like two weeks. ETF take us to the moon argument‚Ä¶.you thought we‚Äôd hit 100k 2 weeks after announcement? Zoom out. The way up to 40k ppl are partying. We correct and dip back down for a retest and it‚Äôs doom and gloom conspiracy?

Who's paying for this post? Look at the body of the post and then OPs responses in the post. You got multiple novels written within the comment section with links and data. Whats the play here exactly? Foment hate for the ETF? Or fear that bitcoin is now going to 0 because of the etf? You seem very prepared and coordinated.

I warned of this long ago, when you look at the macro and understand the threat that crypto is to the status quo of control over the people, you can better grasp how & why they will co-op it to eliminate the threat.

I'm beginning to lean heavily into the presumption BTC was created not by a sole individual but a small cabal with tentacles reaching into every aspect of our seemingly free reality. If BTC does have a malicious agenda behind it, we are all so f***ed when the rug is pulled. We will have already, unknowingly, herded ourselves into a line that's blindly following the next through the newly built construct of a one world government.

Check hashrate. Relax. Study the asset and network. If it‚Äôs gambling for u, hit the booth and cash out. If it‚Äôs moving  hard money 1000 to 5000+ days into the future for you and your progeny, stand down and study what you own.
1
Sigh. You have to understand the principle of markets in that its a net zero game. Theres winners and losers on each end...The ETF is regulated (obviously). When trading ETFs guess who are the losers? The market makers. So they short BTC to off load front costs to enter the ETF onto the platform before they pump it up (also the publicly anticipated halving has every one and their grandma trying to time their entry at lower lows)..Timing or not its a long term buy for this next 3 year cycle.

For people that don‚Äôt believe Bitcoin is valid, I would encourage you to check out any large online gambling site.  They mainly prefer Bitcoin transactions.  Now these are people that are solely in the business of making money.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they insist on dollars, pounds, or other fiat?  They just say ‚Äúwe prefer to be paid in something that may or may not be real?‚Äù  Please.  These are billions revenue global enterprises.  They‚Äôre not stupid.

Manipulation for them to buy even more Bitcoin before it goes way up
1
ETFs were only thought of as a moon trigger by morons who don't understand what ETFs are...Will it make Bitcoin go up long-term? Absolutely. But everyone doesn't just convert their entire 401k to BTC ETFs overnight because there are now 11 ETFs. They could have been buying miners and grayscale this whole time in their 401ks anyway...All this did was take a step in the direction to legitimize crypto as an asset and not just a beanie babie. If 15 years of growth and millions of people believing in it wasn't enough proof... Soon enough, it will be 6 figures per bitcoin, and everyone will say "gotcha" when it falls back down to 40k, and it will be proof that it was a scam all along. And then it will go to half a million and back down to 200k, and everyone will scream "GOTCHA." I knew it was a scam all along...And we will keep doing this for a while.

Satoshi said, every single man should be his own bank, his own custody, his own compliance. Bitcoin blockchain should be free of censorship. ..15 years have passed...Today, people don‚Äôt own Bitcoin directly and its blockchain is under hard KYC censorship...100% directly opposite to Satoshi.
1
Why Grayscale is selling Bitcoins if they cried all 2020-23 right onto our ears ‚ÄúWe Buy and Hodl‚Äù? What value has Bitcoin if it is under hard KYC censorship? Apple makes iPhones, Tesla makes cars, what do Bitcoin miners make, if there is hard KYC censorship over Bitcoin blockchain?

"Okay pal, Ill sell mine for a loss too next week and give u a headsup" JP Morgan got caught doing this in the gold/silver market in 2022 and had to pay a fine (fire some bankers). The precious metals market is still heavily manipulated.

Maybe crypto will die at all. Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency today due to hard KYC censorship that can end by white list of clean Bitcoins and prohibition of self-custody. Bitcoin can survive, but it becomes a perfect anti - crypto scam...What is cryptocurrency, Monero. It is designed from scratch to replace Bitcoin. Even its total coin supply will remain less than Bitcoin supply till year 2040. Will Monero survive? I don‚Äôt know. But we must fight for our fundamental human right of financial privacy and presumption of financial no-guilty. But Monero remains to be a cryptocurrency till win or death.

Why are the ETFs safer bets?  They don't care about the price of bitcoin.  They care about getting authorized agents to give them money

You're talking 100+ years in the future

Yeah, there were plenty of opportunities to buy around $20k not even a year ago. I'm kind of disappointed the lows aren't lower tbh. I could see it doubling from here at some point in the next couple years pretty easily, but I was hoping for more time at the $20k mark to leave more room for growth.

Even worse than precious metal. ETF makes Bitcoin  linked more to high tech assets rather than hedging instruments...I am in Crypto since 2009, the very beginning of Bitcoin birth. What the hell are you doing here, at point of view of the initial adopters...You do all exactly opposite than Satoshi dreamed of. Uncensored blockchain...Bitcoin ETF is exactly denial of being self custody, but cryptocurrency is essentially designed for every singe man to be his own bank...What the bell, guys?! Today, Bitcoin blockchain is fully censored by KYC authorities.
1
Yeah I was pissed when gold hit $0
2
Can you explain this mechanism??
1
Bitcoin has no value since KYC censorship. I expect new ATH will never be achieved. People recognise it and switch to either traditional financial instruments or Monero.
0
In no doubt, KYC authorities are playing to kill Bitcoin in eyes of median customer. Satoshi designed Bitcoin blockchain to be resistant to censorship. But today it is under hard KYC censorship. KYC authorities can‚Äôt interfere and ban transactions right on the blockchain but they can easily mark your Bitcoins dirty or even issue a white list of clean Bitcoins and declare all others are dirty. Instead of financial privacy, Bitcoin brings presumption of your guilty. You have to recognise Bitcoin it is not cryptocurrency anymore, regardless of whether price of this KYC scam will skyrocket. True Bitcoin today is Monero. Even its coin supply will remain less than Bitcoin supply till year 2040. No futures, no ETF, but there are a lot of decentralised exchanges, atomic swaps, and merchants accepting Monero directly, and prepaid cards...Imagine there's no heaven.It's easy if you try.No hell below us.Above us, only sky.Imagine all the people.Livin' for today.Ah.Imagine there's no countries.It isn't hard to do.Nothing to kill or die for.And no religion, too.Imagine all the people.Livin' life in peace.You.You may say I'm a dreamer.But I'm not the only one.I hope someday you'll join us.And the world will be as one‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve leaned this way, but this is what causes me to like BTC. The biggest whale holders don‚Äôt want to rug pull it until they get the whole world to accept it and like it so they can profit more. Even the elite know the dollar is shit and something needed to be done. If you study history, the big wigs rob the public of funds first through inflation (dollar) then deflation (asserts like land, precious medals, and Bitcoin/crypto). I‚Äôm confident Bitcoin will eventual hit 1 million per coin if not higher do to this. Either by around 2030 earliest or 2040 latest

What exactly are you envisioning when you are imagining this "rug pull" that would have any ramifications other than large financial loss within a relatively niche financial sector? And what "one world government" structure that people are "blindly following" exists within BTC?

Yeah. I kicked myself for not buying when it went under $18k in 2022. I‚Äôm also skeptical of the ETF and how hedge funds could manipulate the living hell out of it, but I keep hearing that Bitcoin could have a higher market cap than gold one day. I‚Äôm still in the fence on that, but Bitcoin‚Äôs already proven a lot so far. If it can pull a market cap like that, then you could see like a 16x gain on even this price one day...So anyway, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not buying‚Ä¶

The ETF‚Äôs track exactly the same price action as BTC.

I think we‚Äôll see some event that causes the price to break down into the 20k range again or maybe even lower but buy orders from the new EFT buyers will quickly send the value higher.  Those EFT fund managers need to show quick value and ROI for the Boomers in order to get them to direct more money in this direction. We‚Äôll see. I‚Äôd like to buy more in the 20s!

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-08/jpmorgan-traders-ripped-off-gold-market-for-years-jurors-told. .Basically, they "buy and sell" Btc that they don't own. Someone wants to buy their ETF? Okay. They spend $100 to own $100 worth of their BTC etf. The ETF doesnt go "buy" the $100 worth. But they can invest the $100 until the owner of the $100 ETF tries to sell it... then they can buy it on the open market..$100 is just for a simplisitic breakdown. Most people buy and HODL their crypto, so the ETFs hope for this. Once a commodity like crypto is allowed to traded on an exchange, now it's possible for traders and institutional investors to buy/sell ETF shares they don't own either and even work with each other off the books to keep selling the ETF as a lost. ."Hey buddy, im going to sell the ETF at a 1% loss today.

They don‚Äôt have to corrupt the protocol to destroy the concept economically, ..If the vast majority of people utilize the ETF because if ‚Äúease of usage and/or less fees‚Äù then the actual demand for BTC  will decline along with the price. .The ETF isn‚Äôt holding the BTC on a 1:1 ratio and even if they were over time they will purchase the vast majority of BTC available and will effectively control the market. .The lower the price goes the more people will bail out. ..They do the same thing with gold & other PM‚Äôs through exchanges that have a fractional reserve, think of it as a fractional currency with gold as the backing asset, the exchange floods the market with ‚Äúpaper gold‚Äù and that depresses the price. ..JMO

Oh no, I am pro - hodl, but not a Bitcoin, you see, it is not serious, to have 25% typical volatility in few days, after get maturing for the whole 15 years. Even Monero has much lesser volatility and surprise, lesser coin supply till year 2040 than Bitcoin.

It's all a wild take, but what if BTC is intentionally designed to collapse the monetary system, or play a part in, to force the vast majority into a new financial system that encompasses the entire planet. A one world dollar. A one world government. With leaders of nations, the decision makers of the corporate world, and any and all who hold power of large groups of others start speaking at the world economic forum, it's alarmingly apparent this is the world they envision. A complete collapse of the tiers of wealth. Only the rich, and then the poor... When Klaus Shuab makes statements like " You will own nothing and be happy," I can't help but imagine the potential of this reality. ..Again, this is completely speculative and obviously a foot into the conspiracy theories doorway... But what if BTC is the first domino in making their reality come true.

If you don't understand the correlation between BTC and ETH, you have much to learn. Just because a spot BTC ETF bough 9000 coins, why would that move its price? Erc20 is where the money will be made, BTC is only a storage of wealth.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn‚Äôt have the same authority to conduct examinations of these products as with typical E.T.F.s..‚Äú..https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/business/bitcoin-etf-investing.html..2...‚Äú..As holders of bitcoin they undermine the very purpose, and so the long-term value, of a cryptocurrency.

This suggests that a 50% increase in the price of bitcoin may inaccurately affect the value of an exchange-traded fund due to its other assets...Restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. Bitcoin can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP and others. The Bitcoin ETF will not have the right to trade other cryptocurrencies, since it is not a cryptocurrency, but simply an investment fund that tracks the price of bitcoins...Lack of ownership of bitcoins.

Yes, it is a fight in progress. I described their plan. But we are a side of this war too. We must permanently fight for our fundamental human right - right on financial privacy and right on presumption of financial no-guilty. We must popularise and share in our social media to avoid to interact with Bitcoin ETF at all. We have to popularise privacy coins like Monero, because KYC authorities will create a ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù of clean Bitcoins (ultimate form of censorship) if we ignore to fight. Did you know Monero coin supply will remain less than Bitcoin supply till year 2040? Share this fact in your social media.

The speculators, big money, banks, and governments, have done everything possible to kill monero and projects like it. They want easily traceable, taxable, and controllable digital currencies.

ETFs are required to hold btc 1:1 and the custodian (coinbase) is a publicly traded company who is regularly audited..custodians do not have any more control over changing the rules of the protocol than anyone else..manipulating short term market price does not affect the operation actual bitcoin protocol itself..ETF is good for noobs to get started who are not yet ready for self custody. with self custody being the eventual goal

1
I don‚Äôt really see where these passages are a green light to not hold sufficient quantities of the underlying.  Where you find inconsistencies in ETFs are generally with index funds, where not every security is held, but the fund is required to hold enough other securities to qualify as an index.  The Bitcoin ETFs are not indexes, there are no other assets or asset classes included therein.  They can‚Äôt just sell unbacked placeholders.

Pumping Monero much? Worry about what you do with your own money. You'll sleep better.

Yes the blockchain is public information. That‚Äôs how it works

As I stated even if they are required to keep 1:1 they will over time effectively control the market. ..There are far more investors and traders with far more money than there are ‚Äúnoobs‚Äù and they want instantly conversion processes. ..They want to buy or sell and convert to cash or other assets in a streamline manner and they will flood the ETF. ..The upcoming halving will also have an effect, the more they can size the market supply now the better for them. ..Admittedly I haven‚Äôt looked @ the ratio issue but pretty sure this isn‚Äôt a regular ETF (like stocks) and I‚Äôm sure the structure & rules are different.

Being public or private is not a goal of a blockchain at all. Strict absence of censorship and strict guarantees on being self-custody is the goal. All other applications are secondary (voting system, proof of existence, etc) and could be achieved by other technologies.

whales have ability to cause short term fiat market price movements, that's it. they are in no way able to corrupt or co-opt the bitcoin protocol...as we get closer to btc being worldwide money and market cap becomes comparable to fiat, whales will have smaller and smaller affect on price movement.

Thus, literally you can‚Äôt buy a car for money only...Yes. That is hell of KYC. You can‚Äôt buy a car and furthermore, real estate for money only, in 21th century. But you could, in 19th and earlier 20th.

There is. They can‚Äôt revert transactions yet. But they can mark Bitcoins as dirty or even issue a white list of clean bitcoins. And then, ban all exchange operations with dirty Bitcoins. Also dirty Bitcoins can infect clean ones, being involved into trading (and generally speaking, mixing) process over Bitcoin blockchain.

I‚Äôm not concerned about BTC price at all, i don‚Äôt have or need any, I analyzed it throughly and was almost ready to enter the market until I saw the ETF coming, and another thing that I‚Äôm sure will trigger you, if you think the government doesn‚Äôt have the ability to block the transactions on the blockchain, you‚Äôre delusional. .Don‚Äôt bother telling me otherwise, I know better. ..I have far better performing investments. .IDC but I do understand investing and financial matters, and have my analysis, you can do you.

You can‚Äôt understand so basic concept like survivor mistake? Hint: there are possibly millions other people who tried to do the same, and failed. Can you buy a brand new car with official guarantee? You and millions other people who want to buy a car for Bitcoin? No. Your case is a rare exception from the KYC rule.

btc is about permanently transitioning from a theft-based monetary system of slaves to one of freedom. it's not about trying to find the right time to "enter the market"..can u explain how the government would be able to control all miners dispersed globally and force them to exclude transactions, and provide any evidence of such? there have been many historical examples of mining pools misbehaving and hashpower instantly being directed elsewhere.

I don‚Äôt want a new car. Too much depreciation. Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment network. That is all. Do you realize how common used car sales are between private parties. Every single one of those transactions could be conducted in bitcoin, or any other crypto of choice. You can sell a used car for Kit Kats if you wanted to. The government absolutely has no say in it lol. The only person who has a say is the person selling the car. And the term is survivor bias. Idk man, seems like a major over reaction to a 13% drop. Where was this post at the ATH?

Peter Schiff has to be the greatest marketing genius the world has ever seen. His gains from playing the ‚ÄúBitcoin critic‚Äù are probably greater than had he went all in on Bitcoin in 2012.
2
Lmfao, so would everyone else. The man probably gets high off his own farts.
2
Never listen to someone who has no skin in the game
2
I‚Äôm sure I would too. I don‚Äôt think my hands are that diamond. Had I bought in 2010, I woulda happily sold that long ago. I understand it better now and will hodl for long term
2
Oh you would have sold at ATH.  You must be a f‚Äôing genius to have come up with that idea.
2
He's just too bearish to make decent money. He's been bearish for at least 20 years and was right about 20% of the time.
2
Yeh hold for 14 years, accumulating almost two decades of experience with BTC including what happens at halving‚Ä¶.. only to sell right before what would have been his 4th halving event if he‚Äôd held. Suuuuuuure
2
With respect to him, he has a gold company.  He's not going to back crypto. ..Many potential gold customers are now Bitcoin investors.

Btc critics don't understand btc that's why they are opposed.

And if my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bike.

Ah yes, the Bitcoin critic. A highly sought after profession right now‚Ä¶
1
Why would anyone care what this person has to say
1
Stop fucking talking about Peter Schiff or Cathie Woods. They shouldn‚Äôt matter to anybody.
1
Holy fuck no shit Sherlock. Fucking genius
1
Wow this is groundbreaking what an incredible realization. ..Too bad he didn‚Äôt buy any and he‚Äôs a fool!
1
lol this guy would have sold almost immediately for a loss- he‚Äôs been telling people to do for the whole time, costing anyone who listened to him potentially millions of dollars at this point (and climbing)¬†
1
How is his opinion even relevant? ‚ÄúI failed to buy in 2010, but let me give you this advice now‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Dude. You didn‚Äôt buy when you should have. Stfu.
1
At the bottom of that article it shows him shilling his ordinals, which is nft on bitcoin (backing a crypto).
2
Ah, the classic 'you just don't get it' cope
2
I feel not many people know this quote but I love you for it
1
It really would be nice to never hear this doofus‚Äôs name again lol
1
Even though I've been wrong several times over the last 14 years let me tell you what is he proper way to do things with my grand expertise!
1
This guy has been be best predictor of the bottoms.  What this means is, as unlikely as it looks now, this is probably the last time to get into BTC under previous ATH price.
1
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a recent quote? Been seeing it everywhere the last couple days.

Title:  How much programming skill is necessary to trade? 
35
To answer from a slightly different angle, for longer term,less time-sensitive or mathematically/statistically based strategies you could learn python pretty easily...The closer you edge toward "every millisecond > microsecond > nanosecond matters" the more skill you're going to require in languages "closer to the metal".
5
Having programming skills can definitely give you an edge in cryptocurrency trading, especially when it comes to developing trading bots or analyzing data. However, it's not a requirement to be successful. Many traders rely on technical analysis, market research, and gut instincts rather than coding. It really depends on your trading style and strategy. If you enjoy programming, it can be a fun way to enhance your trading experience, but it's not a must-have skill to get started and see profits in the crypto market. What's your take on this?

Why don't you ask your AI?

2-3 years late bro. I think there were algo bots 2-3 years ago with bybit and other websites. Due to regulations, many have gone out of US soil. So yea, so unless u can program with the trading API, and have your script/bot look at screeners etc.. you're like reinventing the wheel. I did my experiment 2-3 years ago with the bots, they are dumb as rocks and use micro-trading to amass wealth. Eventually u just become a "fee extractor". sure u make money but when u do you taxes, your accountant/tax man would be like, "WTF just HLOD" already. ..The problem with bots is they don't look back at history, they don't have a 'tier' system they look at their just look at certain coins and prices and trade like a blind trader. One of they funny memes was the "**holding bags"**, aka holding rare/untradeble tokens due to market changes...With house trading fees, AI bot (subscriptions), capitial gains tax, your better off just swing/long term trading...Look at bybit I remember they used to have 3commas, or bot trading competition on the best AI crypto bot trading. so yea you're not the one smart guy with glasses.

I think you wrote a watery text. ..If you look at it in general, the development of mankind all its existence is on the path of simplification, and you don't even have to agree with it, it's a fact. ..As far as technical analysis is concerned, it is the most obvious example of the possibility to "simplify" anything. ..automatic programs on the basis of code, analyze and give you already formatted data, so that you, my dear ones, do not get dirty and do not spoil your eyesight by looking at charts and trying to select the indicator you need, and God forgive me if I remember it candlestick patterns...imho, programming and coding is one of the components of any person's strategy.
