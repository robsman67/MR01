Are you confident with your trading skills? there are lots of places to trade Bitcoin/USD. what country are you from?
1
Based in the US.  Yes, I am backtesting some rules and I can follow them, especially because I will be trading daily and weekly charts, nothing shorter term.

That's good, strategy is the best way to trade profitably. I don't trade most times these days but usually when I did, I was more into swing trading, I could leave it for weeks and close my chart.

Trezor Safe 3 ist eine sehr gute Wallet für einen relativ guten Preis von knapp 80€. Die Bedingung ist aber meine ich nur auf Englisch.

So buy low and sell high? Genius! What didn’t anyone else think of this! ..I joke, but in all seriousness, why do you think you have any innate ability to determine when it’s a good time to buy and/or sell? Far more money is lost trying to catch peaks and troughs than just DCA and waiting it out. ..It’s far less stressful to just DCA on a schedule than it is to try and time your entries and exits. Then you also have to consider the tax implications, depending on the country you live in. ..For me I buy the same amount at the same time every week. I don’t even think about it. I transfer funds to my account the night before and buy when I wake up in the morning, on the same day every week.

Who says it is going to go down again??

Learning to trade for profit is a huge ask and most people fail. Your plan to learn it just to use it for a short time doesn’t make sense. Either commit to learn day trading or just buy and hold.
3
I mean, we don't know! but even if it keeps increasing in price, it will have its drawbacks! I guess I was trying to bring light and get advise on what it seems to be simple; only selling BTC when its higher than what you bought it at / Purchasing only if the price is lower or equal to the last price you sold at (assuming we predict it will increase again and reach a new high) ..and obviously, if we get a mega dip, purchasing as much as we can again to sell back only when it recovers.

There are months in which BTC can fluctuate many times between 2%-5% price variations! What if we are there sniping every one of these?? Lol Idk seems stupid but seems as a money machine?? You can all clearly see I am new to this lol

The problem with selling bitcoin is that you end up owning less bitcoin and therefore worse off.
1
When you mentioned about indicators, what about the macro indicators I feel those are a lot more reliable. Meaning the Macro/cycle tops and cycle bottoms. like the Z score indicator and Such. I plan to exit bitcoin at the top of the cycle using those indicators
1
Don't you have to sell it at some point to realize a profit, though? Discuss.

Bitcoin is the profit. You realize profit when you sell your fiat shitcoins for it..Borrow against it or spend it.
1
Thank you for this detailed response. Appreciate it. ..I will try to answer and give one example. Z score. I see on charts over and over again, that if the Z score is above 7 (I think 2 Standard deviations above) that historically signals a cycle top. ..Or if MVRV is above a standard deviation threshold, it indicates (not perfect) a cycle top..Hence, I am planning to use these indicators in particular to exit when they signal a cycle top.

1
Bro I appreciate the response but can you first help me with the above question a posted
1
[effacé]
1
I’m talking about MVRV Z score. ..See your making it too complicated. It’s simple. If I’m looking to sell “nearly” around it close enough to the Cycle top price, I’ll know when that is based on the MVRV-Z score and MVRV Ratio. Very simple.
1
[effacé]

Ok thank you for your comments. Yes other question is… how come everyone doesn’t do this? Am I missing some details? Seems pretty straightforward to time the cycles, however , everyone always says “you can’t time the market”. But using these metrics and indicators, it appears that you can (kind of accurate) time the market

I suggest you think long and hard before jumping in.  There are any number of significant variables such as local government regulations, power consumption, noise factor and the ROI potential.

It's hard to imagine that anything you can find at Walmart would give you what you'd need to make your venture a profitable one.  Good luck!

Your entries have to be very good and you have to be aggressive and emotionally detached at managing your stop losses. To make consistent progress.

Title: Is this how leverage works?
4
2x is mellow, great for trading long time frames. I trade the momentum reversal on the weekly chart at 2x. Good starting point. ..At 10x you have to be really accurate at picking your entries. This is my scalp leverage.
2
Leverage is only radian reasonable for short duration not as a long term position. If you have daily adjusting you will be punched in the face more often than you win. Check out volatility drag to understand better.
2
My advice is just don't. Put your money on a risky low cap alt coin if you want to do something risky with potential big gains. Bitcoin has grown more than any other asset class over the last 13 years so you are sitting on a high growth (and allegedly high risk) asset, just stick with it and don't be greedy/stupid with leverage!
1
Ye but lets say I use 5-8x leverage rn on bitcoin, it most likely won't go down 20% unless the etf doesn't get approved which if that happens I could just cancel the trade. But if it does go up I could walk away with a couple of grand.
2
I understand your point but I do think bitcoin will rally up if the etf gets approved, and I understand the risk in crypto and I'm ok with potential losing $300 for a potential gain of much more.
1
Also what alt coins would you suggest? Things like solana?
1
5 to 8 x leverage on bitcoin is very advanced…. Especially 8x. You will destroy all your money as a newbie. Might as well go party with your savings…...On one trading account I do nearly 800% per year just using 3x leverage and just trading the momentum reversal indicator on the bitcoin daily chart. With good stop loss management. I just blindly buy and sell the signals. It’s boring, it takes a lot of patience and discipline. But it doesn’t take a lot of skill. And $100 can become $400,000 in 4 years. I use the market cipher indicator for this. But Tone Vays has a good and much cheaper MRI indicator. Probably any MRI indicator will do. ..Swing trading at 5x or scalping at 10x on bitcoin takes extreme skills…. No for the beginner. You will die.
1
With leverage you can lose more than your $300. Think about it why would the odds be stacked in your favour so you can gain 2x but not suffer 2x losses.
1
How much is the indicator you use? Market cipher indicador
1
How am I gonna loose more than $300?
1
Like $1000…. Or $1500 these days. Lifetime use...https://marketciphertrading.com
1
https://www.tonevays.com/indicator..This one is only $300…
1
If you can only lose $300 then why would you only 2x leverage, may as well do 1000x
0
Why is there such a massive price difference? Also do you literally just follow the indicator signals and earn 800%? I'm baffled.
2
Because if the price goes down the tiniest bit I would get stopped out.😂
1
How would I loose more money if let's say the rest of the money is in other cryptos or if I only have 300 in the whole account to start off with?
1
I direct messaged you a PnL sheet….
2
If you have negative balance protection then you could just lose your $300 and your account is closed. If not you are in debt.  .Honestly don't do it. If it goes up you gain more but then even if BTC rises dramatically over the next year there will be dips, likely decent size dips along the way,  5% happens regularly and that is it, money gone, game over.
1
It's highly unlikely that after etf gets approved bitcoin will dip below 40000 especially at the amount of resistance displayed at that level plus the massive consolidation at 40000-45000 which I think will act as a resistance .
1
If you think that then go for it. I have no doubt BTC will go up in value over the next two years but I have no idea what crazy event will happen next week. The ETF gets rejected or just delayed, price dips. If it was a sell the news event, people sell straight after the initial uplift etc.  .Basically what I'm saying is you are in a high risk/high reward category already with crypto, leverage is generally not a good idea.  .With crypto you can look at the fundamentals of a project and see it is good so there is a good chance of the price going up, this is fairly easy to see with BTC so buying it and hodling is a good idea. However when you introduce leverage you are simply gambling. Just like at the casino you CAN win, you can win big but overall, in the end the house ALWAYS wins.  .Have a go at leverage but for gods sake if you do win pocket the money, and start again, don't keep building it up on a bigger trade as you will 100% get rekt.
1
What happened today with the SEC Twitter account perfectly illustrates why leverage is a bad idea, a lot of people got rekt today!
1
I've got s trade with leverage I'm up 13% over night😂
1
Well like I said, at the casino you can and often do win, but in the long run the casino ALWAYS wins, it's just stats. Good luck to you, I honestly hope you do make money out of it but remember in the long run the odds are stacked against you. You can have 10 good days and watch it go up, just need one single bad day and it is all gone.  .If you make some money make sure you take some out, if you can take out your original investment then you are always in the positive and just playing with house money.  .Good luck and report back in a couple months time!

Title: Is it worth Day trading or Scalping a few hundred BTCs $300-400? Is it profitable?
2
Day trading is generally not a good idea, especially if you are a beginner. Almost everyone that sells their BTC regrets it in the long term. Most experienced bitcoiners will tell you to buy and hold long term (multiple years or more). But if you want to test the waters of trading then only allocate a small percent of your total portfolio to play with (maybe something like 1-5%). You'll probably lose, but you might learn some things. Personally, I think the best way to trade Bitcoin is to do it on the big long term swings - buy hard in the bear markets, and only sell a bit when grandma comes asking about how to invest in crypto.
3
Swap n commission fees might take more of your profit away if you wanna swing instead of scalp. Also it depends on what platform, spreads, broker and ofc your capital your willing to lose. .Are you willing to lose 300$ ?
1
You have to be insanely disciplined, use a stop loss, know technical analysis and not be emotional or chase losses. Bitcoin is very volatile so easy to be on wrong side of a trade tho I think it's less so since etf money..

Title: Is this how leverage works?
3
2x is mellow, great for trading long time frames. I trade the momentum reversal on the weekly chart at 2x. Good starting point. ..At 10x you have to be really accurate at picking your entries. This is my scalp leverage.
2
Leverage is only radian reasonable for short duration not as a long term position. If you have daily adjusting you will be punched in the face more often than you win. Check out volatility drag to understand better.
2
My advice is just don't. Put your money on a risky low cap alt coin if you want to do something risky with potential big gains. Bitcoin has grown more than any other asset class over the last 13 years so you are sitting on a high growth (and allegedly high risk) asset, just stick with it and don't be greedy/stupid with leverage!
1
Ye but lets say I use 5-8x leverage rn on bitcoin, it most likely won't go down 20% unless the etf doesn't get approved which if that happens I could just cancel the trade. But if it does go up I could walk away with a couple of grand.
2
I understand your point but I do think bitcoin will rally up if the etf gets approved, and I understand the risk in crypto and I'm ok with potential losing $300 for a potential gain of much more.
1
Also what alt coins would you suggest? Things like solana?
1
5 to 8 x leverage on bitcoin is very advanced…. Especially 8x. You will destroy all your money as a newbie. Might as well go party with your savings…...On one trading account I do nearly 800% per year just using 3x leverage and just trading the momentum reversal indicator on the bitcoin daily chart. With good stop loss management. I just blindly buy and sell the signals. It’s boring, it takes a lot of patience and discipline. But it doesn’t take a lot of skill. And $100 can become $400,000 in 4 years. I use the market cipher indicator for this. But Tone Vays has a good and much cheaper MRI indicator. Probably any MRI indicator will do. ..Swing trading at 5x or scalping at 10x on bitcoin takes extreme skills…. No for the beginner. You will die.
1
With leverage you can lose more than your $300. Think about it why would the odds be stacked in your favour so you can gain 2x but not suffer 2x losses.
1
How much is the indicator you use? Market cipher indicador
1
How am I gonna loose more than $300?
1
Like $1000…. Or $1500 these days. Lifetime use...https://marketciphertrading.com
1
https://www.tonevays.com/indicator..This one is only $300…
1
If you can only lose $300 then why would you only 2x leverage, may as well do 1000x
0
Why is there such a massive price difference? Also do you literally just follow the indicator signals and earn 800%? I'm baffled.
2
Because if the price goes down the tiniest bit I would get stopped out.😂
1
How would I loose more money if let's say the rest of the money is in other cryptos or if I only have 300 in the whole account to start off with?
1
I direct messaged you a PnL sheet….
2
If you have negative balance protection then you could just lose your $300 and your account is closed. If not you are in debt.  .Honestly don't do it. If it goes up you gain more but then even if BTC rises dramatically over the next year there will be dips, likely decent size dips along the way,  5% happens regularly and that is it, money gone, game over.
1
It's highly unlikely that after etf gets approved bitcoin will dip below 40000 especially at the amount of resistance displayed at that level plus the massive consolidation at 40000-45000 which I think will act as a resistance .
1
If you think that then go for it. I have no doubt BTC will go up in value over the next two years but I have no idea what crazy event will happen next week. The ETF gets rejected or just delayed, price dips. If it was a sell the news event, people sell straight after the initial uplift etc.  .Basically what I'm saying is you are in a high risk/high reward category already with crypto, leverage is generally not a good idea.  .With crypto you can look at the fundamentals of a project and see it is good so there is a good chance of the price going up, this is fairly easy to see with BTC so buying it and hodling is a good idea. However when you introduce leverage you are simply gambling. Just like at the casino you CAN win, you can win big but overall, in the end the house ALWAYS wins.  .Have a go at leverage but for gods sake if you do win pocket the money, and start again, don't keep building it up on a bigger trade as you will 100% get rekt.
1
What happened today with the SEC Twitter account perfectly illustrates why leverage is a bad idea, a lot of people got rekt today!
1
I've got s trade with leverage I'm up 13% over night😂
1
Well like I said, at the casino you can and often do win, but in the long run the casino ALWAYS wins, it's just stats. Good luck to you, I honestly hope you do make money out of it but remember in the long run the odds are stacked against you. You can have 10 good days and watch it go up, just need one single bad day and it is all gone.  .If you make some money make sure you take some out, if you can take out your original investment then you are always in the positive and just playing with house money.  .Good luck and report back in a couple months time!

That's good, strategy is the best way to trade profitably. I don't trade most times these days but usually when I did, I was more into swing trading, I could leave it for weeks and close my chart.

Title: When will Bitcoin crash?

In any previous pre-having run up we have never pumped this much, without a correction. We are above the usual Fibonacci level we normally reject from for a large correction. ..This time is a little different. So I think it’s hard to say when the dump could come.

When you least expect it.

So buy low and sell high? Genius! What didn’t anyone else think of this! ..I joke, but in all seriousness, why do you think you have any innate ability to determine when it’s a good time to buy and/or sell? Far more money is lost trying to catch peaks and troughs than just DCA and waiting it out. ..It’s far less stressful to just DCA on a schedule than it is to try and time your entries and exits. Then you also have to consider the tax implications, depending on the country you live in. ..For me I buy the same amount at the same time every week. I don’t even think about it. I transfer funds to my account the night before and buy when I wake up in the morning, on the same day every week.

Who says it is going to go down again??
3
Learning to trade for profit is a huge ask and most people fail. Your plan to learn it just to use it for a short time doesn’t make sense. Either commit to learn day trading or just buy and hold.
3
I mean, we don't know! but even if it keeps increasing in price, it will have its drawbacks! I guess I was trying to bring light and get advise on what it seems to be simple; only selling BTC when its higher than what you bought it at / Purchasing only if the price is lower or equal to the last price you sold at (assuming we predict it will increase again and reach a new high) ..and obviously, if we get a mega dip, purchasing as much as we can again to sell back only when it recovers.
1
There are months in which BTC can fluctuate many times between 2%-5% price variations! What if we are there sniping every one of these?? Lol Idk seems stupid but seems as a money machine?? You can all clearly see I am new to this lol

The problem with selling bitcoin is that you end up owning less bitcoin and therefore worse off.

When you mentioned about indicators, what about the macro indicators I feel those are a lot more reliable. Meaning the Macro/cycle tops and cycle bottoms. like the Z score indicator and Such. I plan to exit bitcoin at the top of the cycle using those indicators

Don't you have to sell it at some point to realize a profit, though? Discuss.

Bitcoin is the profit. You realize profit when you sell your fiat shitcoins for it..Borrow against it or spend it.
1
Thank you for this detailed response. Appreciate it. ..I will try to answer and give one example. Z score. I see on charts over and over again, that if the Z score is above 7 (I think 2 Standard deviations above) that historically signals a cycle top. ..Or if MVRV is above a standard deviation threshold, it indicates (not perfect) a cycle top..Hence, I am planning to use these indicators in particular to exit when they signal a cycle top.

Bro I appreciate the response but can you first help me with the above question a posted

[effacé]

I’m talking about MVRV Z score. ..See your making it too complicated. It’s simple. If I’m looking to sell “nearly” around it close enough to the Cycle top price, I’ll know when that is based on the MVRV-Z score and MVRV Ratio. Very simple.

Ok thank you for your comments. Yes other question is… how come everyone doesn’t do this? Am I missing some details? Seems pretty straightforward to time the cycles, however , everyone always says “you can’t time the market”. But using these metrics and indicators, it appears that you can (kind of accurate) time the market

Have you tried closing a trade that is in 5% or 10% profit and see how your actual account balance changes?..Also 10x is a lot of leverage on BTC if you are new to scalping. Your entries have to be very good and you have to be aggressive and emotionally detached at managing your stop losses. To make consistent progress.

Title: Is it worth Day trading or Scalping a few hundred BTCs $300-400? Is it profitable?
2
Day trading is generally not a good idea, especially if you are a beginner. Almost everyone that sells their BTC regrets it in the long term. Most experienced bitcoiners will tell you to buy and hold long term (multiple years or more). But if you want to test the waters of trading then only allocate a small percent of your total portfolio to play with (maybe something like 1-5%). You'll probably lose, but you might learn some things. Personally, I think the best way to trade Bitcoin is to do it on the big long term swings - buy hard in the bear markets, and only sell a bit when grandma comes asking about how to invest in crypto.
3
Swap n commission fees might take more of your profit away if you wanna swing instead of scalp. Also it depends on what platform, spreads, broker and ofc your capital your willing to lose. .Are you willing to lose 300$ ?

You have to be insanely disciplined, use a stop loss, know technical analysis and not be emotional or chase losses. Bitcoin is very volatile so easy to be on wrong side of a trade tho I think it's less so since etf money..
