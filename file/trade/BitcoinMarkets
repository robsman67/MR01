Lots of bearish takes on bitcoin seem to discount the fact that it’s trading - more or less - in lockstep with risk equities. And this is pretty typical when volume is lower and policy is tight. ..There has just been another big sell-off in both. And yet most of the bearish takes I see here focus only on bitcoin and its long-term prospects. ..Most of the big bitcoin runs have lined up with a pervasive risk-on attitude in markets. We don’t have that now. Just think about it logically. We are at the tail end of a tightening cycle in response to a major economic whipsaw distortion from the pandemic. Holders of leveraged assets are sweating, hoarding cash to buy down debt to avoid insolvency risk. Consumer goods stretched pricing to the limits. Real estate found a ceiling and began to stall. And a major election in the world’s biggest financial market is underway...In short, liquidity is waiting on the sidelines because now is the exact wrong time to make a lot of big moves. ..That said, two big catalysts for easing and kickstarting the flow of global liquidity are on the horizon. ..1) The US election. It is very common for US markets to stall out leading up to the November of the election. Major investors want to know the policy outlook for the next half decade before placing long-term bets. Almost always, no matter who wins, you get a run after the election. Now they know what to buy, so they’re all buying *something*..2) Rate cutting cycle. We are over the tipping point and the Fed will likely begin cutting interest rates this month. This reduces the debt burden on leveraged assets and begins freeing up liquidity ..And, as we know, when liquidity flows bigly, bitcoin pamps. In my opinion, any price action this month is not even worth looking at. Get out and order yourself a pumpkin spice latte. Go for a walk. Play some golf. ..In other words, HODL

This is a chart with the comparison of the cycles with a starting point of the cycle low. Which is what I believe is also where the start of the 4-year cycle is, and it's 4 phases within (accumulation, growth, bubble and crash, should be started...[https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-cycle-low](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-cycle-low)..BTC is just being BTC. It is right in the middle of the last 2 cycles...Now if you take out the genesis cycle (you will need to do this on the chart yourself), it looks like BTC is well ahead. ..Sorry for not providing the 2nd chart w/out the genesis cycle. I don't belong to glassnode.

Reading the early posts on today’s daily: aw, the smell of capitulation in the morning! Smells like wealth-growing opportunity. From their wallets to mine.

I think the S&P500 is looking close to being topped out here.  [On the monthly we’re seeing 3 drives on bear divs which has historically lead to a sharp drawn down.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gcw3IMNx/)  While many are eager for another 2008 collapse, I’m not convinced we’ll see this.  I think structurally (beyond just this chart) we’re closer to a 60’s or 90’s style reset with resumption of secular trend.
12
I remember being on the other side of the rate hikes back in ‘21 thinking ‘its priced in!’ … lol...well the shoe is about to be on the other foot… ..and we had the gox distribution , whaaat ? We are still sitting over 50k … this isnt so bad really …..complete mainstream apathy to the space? ..Perfect. ..Feels like a total reset and we are starting from 50k this time …

Any thoughts on whether it's likely US gov has been/is selling coins that moved to coinbase recently?

Potential higher low at $52.5k. Will it hold or will we retest the $49.1k bottom from last month? We’ll see...[Historically](https://www.coinglass.com/today), September has been the worst month for BTC in terms of average return (-5.03%) and September has been the second worst month in terms of median return (-6.30%). Historically, October is the best month in terms of median return and the second best month in terms of average return, followed by November which is the best month in terms of average returns...MTD we are below both the average and median September return right now even after recovering a bit from the potential higher low at $52.5k. If you subscribe to the idea that BTC will have a strong October/November as it typically does historically, seems like a solid entry point to load up and sit on your hands until Q4 arrives.

I’m officially creeped out by this slow, weird trawling around this zone.  Spidey sense is tingling…

curious how high can we recover before the markets open and we have next leg down

I came here originally because the insane fanboy vibe at r/bitcoin got so tiresome and I wanted more reasonable, well thought out takes. Now that this sub has been taken over by bed wetting doom boys, Is there a subreddit where I can go where there is less crying and complaining? I thought this was a trading sub but it’s been dumb around here for weeks. If y’all want to cover your positions shut up and open a short.

The minimal recovery that has been ongoing for the past 18 hours or so can only be described as pathetic, both in terms of the measly price increase and volumes (I am looking at a Bitfinex chart). Who can blame the market for the lacklustre demand, when, after an exceedingly rare and quite formidable bounce, which occurred around August 5, the price got hammered down merely two weeks later, pulverising the previous gains in a very short time? What irritates me further is that most of the top 100 altcoins on [bitcoinwisdom.io](http://bitcoinwisdom.io) are showing somewhat higher gains than BTC, which has been so typical in recent years...No matter how one slices and looks at it, the old days of fast (upward) movements and very good gains over the course of months and, certainly, years, which would dwarf anything seen in tradfi markets, seem to be gone. I am of course hoping that reality will soon prove this assessment wrong, and yet, this waiting game of hoping is in itself an indication that something feels off. My gut feeling is that in the best case, the price can make it past 100K by early or spring 2025, only to crumble again under the immense pressure from sellers, both newbies and long-term holders, who call it a day and cash out a very substantial share of their holdings...The way this price action and market are currently behaving, it will take nothing less than major governments or central banks announcing the establishment of strategic BTC reserves IMHO to push the price up to 150K and beyond. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I have not seen any statements to this effect, and I therefore don't expect this to happen anytime soon.

Just a rant from someone involved in the space since 2013: I think most people have stopped caring about cryptocurrency and bitcoin. The novelty of it all is played out. The original promise of a universal Internet currency accepted everywhere online is long gone. The days of crazy returns are also gone...OG whales and Gox payout recipients have been steadily selling off large amounts of their holdings for months on end, IMO because they've simply lost interest after a decade or more. The ETF's effect on price has been underwhelming at best, and ETF inflows seem to have peaked as well. Reading various forums, it's clear the vast majority are in bitcoin ultimately for the potential USD gains...To the extent that people like the properties of cryptocurrency -- self-custody, rapid transactions, low costs, whatever -- it's psychologically easier to just use USDC or some other stablecoin, whose UX is essentially identical to BTC except its value doesn't wildly fluctuate *and* it can pay interest...We've been in a bearish trend for 6 months now. Where is the money or even the interest for the next bitcoin bull run coming from?.___________.(And the downvotes followed by no real rebuttal generally means an uncomfortable truth has been stated...)

Are there any greater fools left?  With ETFs, retail have been able to provide liquidity for the OGs to sell.  ..Only large corporations and governments left.  Are they going to take the bags off us?  Seems like wishful thinking at this point. ..4 year cycles prob need to be broken.  Far too much long exposure from retail owning derivatives, miner stock and MSTR.  Belief in the 4 yr cycles means that retail can be edged to death deep into 2025.  ..I sincerely hope the supply shock does arrive, but shock is not what I’d feel if it doesn’t.  In the meantime, I’ve increased my DCA allocation

Wise words…. If I had stopped checking prices and reading this sub multiple times a day, I would probably had more BTC, less stress and a single handicap

Regarding TradFi, your number 1 point is the most influential sentiment influencer. TradFi investors want certainty and disdain uncertainty. It has always been that way.
3
How's the golf game going?
2
Dominating narrative now seems to be that the rate cuts will actually cause further sell off, and pump will happen few months later when effects can be seen...So I do not think people doubt crypto will be worth more some time in the future. People just do not want to round trip down theough the secular bear if it is going to start and drags crypto down.

I think it's safe to say this is the highest price that sentiment has been this low in this subreddit, ever.

M&M 's rules it all, seems to me. Chart, challenging to look at it.

It wasn't mainstream apathy the last cycle bottoms, it was mainstream distain and derision.

Could be, would explain *some* of the recent PA. ..And the rest could be explained by "they" taking advantage of the fear and pushing the price around during low-liquidity hours.

Sorry to hear that, you must be nervous a lot. I’m enjoying fall, it’s beautiful out. Hope you feel better!

No don't worry it's only like that during slaughter periods, then it allegedly turns super bullish during the bull run and for the remaining of time follows kinda the market sentiment but with a bullish bias

/r/bitcoin will be at its worst when bitcoin is going down../r/bitcoinmarkets will be at its worst when bitcoin is going sideways

There is no trading sub where people won’t come out of the woodwork to talk their book/try to pump their bags during uncertain/volatile times. Whether they really believe what they’re saying or not, no one can know.
2
We all turn bullish very quickly...We just moan when it’s not going up
4
You need to keep in mind the timeframe we're in right now in comparison to previous bitcoin cycles. Typical bitcoin bullruns don't usually occur until several months after the halving, or at least a year from cycle lows. This time we simply got an overheated pump at an unusual time because of ETFs. but instead of a massive blow-off top we got this slow bleed.
7
Like everything in finance, BTC outsized returns were a factor of potential, risk, and investors' profile and strong convictions. Risk is now much lower and although I'm not an OG, it seems strong believers have never been lower in proportion compared to people like you. So indeed there's no reason to have similar returns unless we get big fundamental news...Even then, gains can still be a lot larger than anything in tradfi, borderline meme stocks like Tesla (50% away from ATH after a 75% drawdown btw) or Nvidia will only do one facemelting bullrun. Altcoins got destroyed the past months and have bad liquidity, that's why you see bigger bounces. If you look at the 365 days change, their risk adjusted returns are horrible (excluding Solana, but not for the best reasons).
6
If you want the broad strokes on market direction, investigate global liquidity and velocity. These are the starting principles and dictate ebb and flow.  Read Stanley Druckenmiller.

Normies aren’t part of what happens next. There’s a difficult truth. ..I’ll worry when governments stop issuing unsustainable levels of debt. ..PA is rotten mind you. It helps to have seen.

Bitcoin was never about the spending, it was about the saving.  It’s been one of the most dominant juggernaut assets in history and 6 months of chop doesn’t take away from this.  ..Bitcoin is a totally unique asset that’s orthogonal to the rest of the market.  It’s what makes it exciting and also difficult to understand.  If the furthest you’ve travelled in the space after so many years is:  I can’t buy coffee with this shit and the only real use is to trade back to fiat then I’d assume you’re in the camp of not understanding what’s happening below the surface. ..The idea that ‘people have lost interest’ is silly.  BlackRock and US presidential candidates have to acknowledge Bitcoin now and incorporate it into their operation because it’s ingratiated in the collective mind.  This was impossible to imagine in 2018.  There may be issues with this, but it’s not as if Bitcoin has somehow lost favor.  It’s the opposite; Bitcoin is now a major global talking point.  Having been here for more than a decade it’s kind of mind boggling. ..The next wave of price appreciation always originates form the same place: As the denominator by which this asset is largely priced (dollars) inflates in size, the nominal value of Bitcoin rises as well.  And historically it outpaces the denominator.  It’s bested all other asset classes along these same metrics (asset/M2 money supply) over the last 16 years.  This may not always be the case, but it’s impossible to ignore or deride at this point.
22
People downvoting you clearly don't understand what these threads are for. This is a perfectly valid interpretation of the current situation.
11
Earning interest on stablecoins is not exactly without risk. You’re only safe with your BTC in cold storage.

>The original promise of a universal Internet currency..There aren't any promises on the white paper.   ...>OG whales and Gox payout recipients have been steadily selling off large amounts of their holdings for months on end..Prove it.  ...>they've simply lost interest after a decade or more...Your opinion is that they lost interest over those crazy gains over a decade!?  ...>The ETF's effect on price has been underwhelming at best,..Calling underwhelming from 16k to 73k.  ...>The ETF's effect on price has been underwhelming at best, and ETF inflows seem to have peaked as well...A few months of history and already calling the peak?  ...>And the downvotes followed by no real rebuttal generally means an uncomfortable truth has been stated....You haven't said anything but your baseless opinion.
7
I invest in Bitcoin for the long term reliable returns.  A very very low inflationary currency (BTC) is priced against a much higher inflationary currency (USD) will outperform over time. ..I'm going to down vote you now.
11
As far as I know the metrics showed OG whale wallets increasing their holdings, so that's a narrative in your head because the price went down. No need to engage the other (outdated) points because you've been negative for months and I don't even know why you're still around.
4
I completely agree with your summary. ..The only counter I can give is that during bear markets and long drawn out corrections I always feel like it’s over. ..Then a new narrative kicks in and we continue the ride. I’m holding onto a change in sentiment
6
I upvoted your post, because I like the fact that you are raising uncomfortable questions, which are the prerequisite for any interesting discussion. What you say resonates with the observations and vibes I have registered while watching the price action and following the discussion in here over the past couple of years...The matter of the fact is that BTC is not used in everyday commerce and trade and that the vastly overwhelming majority of transactions are executed by people with the sole intent of buying it in order to lock in hefty gains and at some later point convert those into fiat...There is no doubt that fiat currencies and the banking system in which they operate are staring down the barrel of a progressively worsening crisis of confidence that will at a certain point require a system reset and shockingly painful financial reforms of some kind...The fact that Bitcoin appears not to be benefiting, price-wise from this galloping crisis, but has in fact been showing increasing signs of weakness (Sartori ratio) in recent years, gives holders of this asset cause for concern. It is counter-intuitive and could explain the growing sense of frustration that is voiced in this forum, not just by newbies but also by very seasoned investors like yourself who have lived through every conceivable contortion the market has thrown at them over the years...While I don't really understand what is going on, I do share your sense of concern.
5
Institutions and governments, one would expect.
2
The argument is basically like saying fiat > gold. Obviously there is merit to this in terms of utility, but it is ignoring the core premise of BTC.  Utility was a dead idea a long time ago, and USDC isnt better than VISA anyways. BTC does move about 15B a day in value which is impressive in its own way as a p2p system, but this is meaningless vs SWIFTs 15 TRILLION a day.
2
You  are not OG from 2013 (maybe you been shitcoiner from 2013 ), I can see you never understood bitcoin ......Mt Gox coins gone to my cold storage and will be sold only in extreme need for cash and probably I will die with my HODL stack .

100% agree.

The only bullish thing I can think of is rate cuts. Even then, if it's 25 basis points and not 50 bitcoin will dump.

Many thanks for the suggestion, much appreciated.

*"Normies aren’t part of what happens next. There’s a difficult truth."* ..What do you mean by that, and what does this hold for Bitcoin, in your view? Are you implying that we are about to see a disastrous crash, followed by a major reset with currency reforms and the possible introduction of CBDC?..I must admit that I am quite worried about such prospects.
1
*"The idea that ‘people have lost interest’ is silly. BlackRock and US presidential candidates have to acknowledge Bitcoin now and incorporate it into their operation because it’s ingratiated in the collective mind."*..Perhaps one could say the rate at which *new* people and fresh capital are entering the space has been slowing in recent years while everyday use of BTC as a means of payment in exchange for an actual good or service is only marginally higher than in 2009?..Another explanation as to why price rises have began to slacken very noticeably (Sartori ratio) over the past couple of years might focus on the effect of futures trading. In the precious markets, where holders have over the decades suffered immense frustration over the lack in price appreciation, despite the fact that their assets are universally perceived as hard and rare, many observers speculated that the price of spot gold was manipulated through "paper trading". These people often used to point to the fact that much more "paper gold" existed than real physical material...I have seen the argument that something similar has been going on with BTC futures and "spot" BTC, and perhaps the new ETFs also play a role in hypothetical price manipulation to the downside. Unlike with gold, silver and other PMs and metals, for that matter, there is no industrial demand for BTC, which one could argue makes it more prone in the case of a crisis of confidence...These are just random and uninformed speculations. Unfortunately, I lack the skills to analyse such matters with the rigour and depth that is required to obtain clearer and more definitive findings.
5
This isn't really "chop", it's a slow-but-steady decline of over 25% and counting...Investment firms and politicians can mention Bitcoin all they want, but I don't think they're actually minting many new buyers anymore. You need new money for 'number go up', and it hasn't been happening in spite of some well-known firms and people acknowledging bitcoin. BTC conferences are just circlejerks among old timers. ETF interest seems to have peaked. If there really are tons of new buyers, they can't even absorb the massive amount of coins old-timers are selling off...And yes, BTC has bested other asset classes over 15 years because *it started from a market cap of zero*. Now that it's well established with a $1T market cap, the likelihood it continues to do so over the next decade or whatnot is slim at best, in my opinion.
2
+1 This place is for discussion.  Discussion involves multiple perspectives.
1
>There aren't any promises on the white paper...There may not be any promises but the paper starts off like this.....*"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"*..*"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"*..That initial premise is long gone and replaced with a store of value proposition which is absolutely fine but lets not deny that there's been a change of plan...
1
I have no idea how anyone could look at the chart over the last 3 or 4 years and call the returns "reliable"..."Reliable" is a bank CD where you earn a fixed, known-in-advance amount of interest every month, not an asset that might double one year, then drop 75% the next, regardless how it performs vs inflation.
1
instead and on the contrary, btc is global and independent, high value, decentralized and trustles settlement system -it's not about transaction speed -it's about tx final settlement time and tx reversibility. ..on the other hand swift is simply secure messaging intrabank system - with final settlements taking days or even weeks to settle. it's centralized, level of trust may be restricted depending on macro conditions, same for fed wire and fed now - fed ledger entries for reserves transfers are updated once a month or even quarter depending on tx volume. not to mention % cost of transfers...also on the other hand btc takes on average 10 minutes to finally settle, tx are cheap and value independent,.
3
As I understand it, 50 bps signals to tradfi that "this is only happening because we're in serious trouble" and they panic sell. Starting with 25 bps is better now but the fed should've started that 2 months ago
1
ETFs were not what caused this awful downtrend in the past few months. In fact they're the only reason we got this premature pump before the typical bitcoin cycle. It's OG whales dumping + PA coming primarily from heavily manipulated futures market/exchanges.. Particularly Binance and OKX. Specially thanks to dumbass overleveraged longs who kept repeatedly doubling down instead of simply simply buying spot.
1
CBDCs are not cryptpcurrencies: they may be digital, but their issuency and other control is not the effect of code chosen by the community....I don't see what currency reforms could be added. Certainly not to prevent individual actors (retail) to participate, there's no need for that, tradfi markets have shown that big participants don't need that to get whatever share they want through manipulating market psychology. Which is what they do best, and I think that's what the above poster wants to say....About a big crash: in my mind, tradfi actors will not break long term TA and indicators, because that would break the product they have started to sell. So for instance YoY and 4y returns will stay positive. But that still makes enough place for them to crash hard enough to make retail desperate (42k$ ??), and they will....Actually, everytime I see a frustrated, angry or dejected comment, it reminds me that we are very much retail here (I don't mean that I'm not affected, or that I'm 100% sure it'll always go up, but that I know the number above which there's no reason to loose faith, and below which the only thing to do is to end this admittedly very nice adventure and look at other investments and topics).
1
Precious metal rehypothecation or paper derivates are easier methods to obfuscate real supply in physical money markets as compared to Bitcoin because audit of storage around these real assets is onerous. ..It’s really hard to account for how many gold bars are held in Fort Knox or any other storage facility.  And do you trust the source?  How often is the data refreshed?  Can you verify for yourself?  ..In turn, Bitcoin is digital and open to review by anyone as a public ledger which makes these kinds of audits easier and more transparent (while not totally immune to the above)...The idea that Bitcoin wins as a payment network never computed to me (despite language to this end in the white paper), as payment rails are already hardened (Visa, ApplePay, etc) and not a real pain point (at least in the west). The problem was never spending; the solution was saving a hard money asset that’s immune from centralized manipulation. ..*Runaway central bank monetary policies completely destroy the savings of hard working ordinary individuals around the world.*. This is why people are interested in Bitcoin.  ..The fact that Bitcoin isn’t used as a way to pay regular transactions has *actually* bolstered the price.  This is the whole MV = PQ theory in economics whereby the velocity of the money spent as related to goods affects the value of the money itself (as they’re interrelated).  When velocity is low (i.e HODLers) the price of that asset increases around demand.  ..People don’t spend assets that appreciate; they spend assets that depreciate.  It’s why the FED keeps a 2% inflation rate to encourage spending. This makes dollars *useful* but not *valuable*.  People often conflate and confuse the two wanting Bitcoin to work as dollars in order to be ‘valuable’ when it’s the opposite.
11
They’re minting so many new buyers that Bitcoin hit new ATH’s *before* the halving which never happened before.  You’re too zoomed in.   [Bitcoin is now in the median range of all prior cycles based on time.](https://x.com/nsquaredvalue/status/1831465800596607396?s=61)  Price got over its skis and now mean reverting.

Narratives are created by the community and are constantly evolving..."Store of value" is a narrative...&#x200B;..The fundamentals are created by the developers and evolve slowly, if at all...*"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"* is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin that has not changed...I could send $10M to someone on the other side of the globe, this morning on a weekend, for $0.32 in fees, have the transaction confirmed in the next block and be settled with finality in the next 10 minutes directly peer to peer with no other entity involved. Just like always.

> "Reliable" is a bank CD where you earn a fixed, known-in-advance amount of interest every month, ..nothing is reliable if inflation eats your interests.
9
My time horizon is longer than 3 years. Even in tradfi, VC investing is 5 years of capital calls followed by 5 years of distributions. So you need to look at 5 years as the minimal benchmark...Edit. Just to add, you are only looking at one timeframe when you say "last 3 years". That's cherry picking. ..And when I compare it against VC funds, that's a short investment horizon. The largest endowments look at a timeframe of 100+ years and regularly invest in evergreen funds which make VC investing look like day trading...Have another down vote.

This comment being downvoted proves they dont have a clue. This is why they keep getting laughed at in finance subreddits. No arguments, just cult emotions.

>instead and on the contrary, btc is global and independent, high value, decentralized and trustles settlement system..How can BTC be regarded as truly independent when buyers/investors need to first go to an exchange that is overseen and regulated by the powers that control the fiat money system with its (central and commercial) banks and transaction networks, plus the underlying internet and electrical infrastructures upon which all of these actors depend?
-1
Thanks for your reply and explanation...>*The idea that Bitcoin wins as a payment network never computed to me (despite language to this end in the white paper), as payment rails are already hardened (Visa, ApplePay, etc) and not a real pain point (at least in the west). The problem was never spending; the solution was saving a hard money asset that’s immune from centralized manipulation.*..Can Bitcoin be truly independent from central manipulation and censorship, when users/investors need to first go to an exchange in order to convert it into a different currency that runs on another payment network, in order to purchase a good or service in the real world?..The way I see it, the two aspects are closely interconnected. The powers who have the ability to shutter or suspend the operations of the onramps/exchanges, who can blacklist the BTC owned by someone, who moreover control said other payment networks (and who probably entertain clandestine relationships with the manufacturers of HW wallets) are the ones that are actually pulling the strings...IMHO, Bitcoin's independence is impressive on paper but eventually it is highly theoretical. When push comes to shove, the average BTCer today finds himself painted into a corner in many different ways. I believe the Canadian truckers and their backers would probably agree with this statement.
1
Average annual returns were great up until 2021, *because the asset class started from a market cap of zero*...Since it hit $1T market cap, it's basically gone nowhere, because the supply of new interested investors has died out. Or at least they're being balanced out by the old-timers' massive dumping. If you're betting on the oft-mentioned "institutions/governments" to swoop in and keep the party going forward, I get that. In the sense of companies or governments holding BTC on their balance sheet as an inflationary hedge, I personally don't think it's ever going to happen to any significant extent and I don't know where future returns will come from.

1. They may prefer, but don’t need to use a centralized exchange...2. They may prefer, but don’t need to trade it for fiat money. ..3. They may prefer, but don’t need to transact over Internet. (Radio, satellite and SMS works).

Useful store of value was necessarily required before recognized global payment.  We’re moving through that middle phase right now.

You're confusing my explanation of long term institutional investing methodologies to predictions of institutions investing in the crypto asset class. I'm not talking about what institutions invest in. Simply defining what a long term investment horizon looks like.
5
Interesting, but then, from the perspective of the average BTCer, are these feasible options that people are familiar with and actually using?..Where or how do people buy BTC without going through an exchange, through an ETF and without having a normal bank account in the first place?..Are houses, flats and cars routinely paid for in BTC? Can stocks and securities be paid for in BTC?
1
Alternative transaction methods are feasible but won’t be commonly used by those with Internet access. There are wallets that support SMS.  ..You can acquire BTC outside traditional banks and exchanges through P2P platforms, in-person trades, and Bitcoin ATMs.   ..Paying for large assets like houses and cars happens but is not yet routine. You can buy stocks indirectly by converting to fiat money, or buy tokenized stocks.

Title: Day Trading advice needed - How to exit a position properly?
9
I know you said you don’t like them, but when I’m just scalping I always use trailing SL/TP. However my strategy is to limit losses at the expense of (potential) limited profit. ..I can have a tight stop hit and exit the trade with minimal losses 100+ times before I’m in the red for the day because a single trade in the right direction with a trailing TP can easily make up for it. ..Cut your losers quickly, let your winners ride (until the trailing TP hits)

Look into trailing stops. When I was trading, that was one of my favorite methods. You essentially set a price or percent delta and the stop will follow the price up and then trigger when it falls a certain amount. For example, if the price is $100 and you set a 1% trailing stop, the stop will start at $99. If the price moves up to $110, then the stop will move up to $108.9...It's a way to lock in a gain, and also be able to participate if the price just keeps rising. The art of it is determining how big the delta should be to ride the price up without the stop getting hit from random fluctuations...EDIT: Sorry just saw the rest of your post about trailing SL/TP. I would advise playing around with the trailing amounts to get a better result. And you could even look into making the trailing dynamically based on the current volatility to customize each trade.
2
Trailing TP? What do you mean? It is just regular Trailing SL, just when the price moved in expected direction so much, that it stops out in the profit?..Either way, you gave me an idea of "catching peaks". If price is moving slowly in desired direction, it should let it ride. However, if it "peaks", it should sell position into that peak for great profit...This is not sureway to exit a position, but definitely a good one if it happens.
1
Hmm, interesting point about dynamic trailing. I'll try something with it, and tell you how it went...  .Thanks!
1
By trailing TP I simply mean what some might refer to as a "trailing SL" with the SL (eventually) in profit. Yes, exactly like you said. ..For example, on a long I might set a trailing stop that is 1% below the current price. If that stop is hit quickly, I'm out 1% (not accounting for leverage), no big deal. However if the price goes up as I expected it to (since I opened a long) the trade is in profit as soon as the price is 1% over my entry and my stop moves to in profit. The stop will continue to move up behind the current price so that I "catch the peak" as you put it, within 1% at least...The difficulty with this strategy is volatility. You have to adjust the trailing stop percentage and leverage. As volatility increases, I lower my leverage and widen the percentage of my trailing stop otherwise you just get chopped to pieces...You'll never find a strategy that gives you perfect entries and exits. My goal is simply to limit my downside risk while capturing as much upside as possible. If I can make 50% on one trade, I can lose 1% over and over and over and still be in the green.
3
Nice thoughts, much appreciated!..  .Which timeframes do you trade in general? How do you calculate volatility?..I know it's an example, but IMO, 1% trailing is pure gamble. Similar to "100X leverage trading strategy", right?

The dip keeps dipping
15
2% range on a 1 minute candle for payroll is insane
13
If you squint hard enough, you'll see a higher low on the daily
12
if we hold 52k and make a higher low, I’ll be happy. If we go below that then look out below. But I’ll be buying anything in the 40s.
12
$MSTR not dropping as much (so far) is some kind of a bullish divergence, maybe 50k will hold.
11
So while everyone is pretty bearish here, I’ll pile on.  September tends to be a terrible month for equities and momentum in BTC is heading down locally.  I wouldn’t be shocked to see [BTC retest the ETF breakout before a reversal.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/D0VLG1CQ/)
18
Despite the negative sentiment, if Bitcoin can hang on right here and range for the rest of the year, it would still be consolidating in a bullish formation. I wrote about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1f4m45k/comment/lkos56e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about a week ago, sharing that price could head down to that lower trendline again and form a higher low, between $53-54k. Well, that's [where price is now. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VdKmYiCz/)Breaking down from here shows the next stop could easily be the bottom of the [larger pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CliypUgr/), which would make a lower low in the $47-48k range. This would probably scare enough people into thinking price is headed down to $42k or $38k. It would feel awkward to buy there, once support has seemingly broken. Likewise, it also seems scary to buy here. So, if you're bullish, these are the things to watch. ..On the bearish side (that's where I hang out), a breakdown from this level would seemingly disrupt the larger bullish consolidation unless it's quickly bought up before the daily and weekly closes. For bearish confirmation, I'd ideally like to see a much deeper selloff below the broadening pattern into the $38k-42k range and towards the 200 week MA. From there, see how big a bounce occurs and assess. ..Until price starts to show some strength and returns above the daily[ moving averages](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5W94p041/), I'm holding my shorts. My guess is that if the 50 week MA fails (red on [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLKcQ2v0/)), price will want to drift back towards the 200, closer to $40k. ..Let's see! Good luck friends. ..-Victor Cobra

This was posted 9 Feb 2024:..>In sum: 2017 took us from 1K to 20K. 2025 will take us from 100K to a mil...>This is conservative. 200K by 12/31/24 would not surprise me...30 weeks later, I'm beginning to think that this analysis is not, in fact, conservative.  I will also admit that $200K by EOY would surprise the ever-living fuck out of me at this point.  So I'm cracking a beer.
21
So the numbers are in:.142.000 new jobs (161.000 expected) and unemployment rate 4.2% (4.2-4.3% expected)...Guess the FED will cut the rates with just 25 BP
8
Sept average is BTC down -6% or so. ..Lets see if we can do better!
8
So, I have no idea what I am doing with trading, but constantly trying to learn...I am not understanding all the aspects of the federal rate cut, whispers of recession, and the bitcoin price failing other than it being a "high risk" asset. I would think that with the money printing the government has done and how fast the US is accumulating debt along with the rate cut, which I think would increase inflation rate, right?..Take those aspects along with the fact that BTC is traded on a global market along with the fact that it is inflation-limited and I would assume that the price is going to go up simply by the dollar losing value comparatively. In other words, as long as the whole world market doesn't go to shit (which I realize the US is a decent chunk of) then BTC will increase over time still. I am hearing a lot of doom and gloom though. Just looking for a discussion to hopefully gain some enlightenment. Even things for me to look up to learn more...What I see if I zoom all the way out is a parabolic curve along more or less a steady bottom starting in 2014 and if you follow it up (don't know how to do this sort of thing on TradingView yet to illustrate) it would be at about the $52000 level right now. I imagine this over the years following a Sigmoid function to create an s-curve as market cap increases and crypto-currency is adopted and market is further globalized. If you follow that initial parabola we see the "cycles", "black swans" or whatever you want to call them jumping up above, but I see the base pattern fairly easily. Taking a look at this and the power rule it would look like we might bottom out soon around $52k (maybe slightly lower) and then start heading back up by far surpassing $100k eventually around the end of May I would guess...Again, I am just looking at patterns and don't really know trading that well. So I don't have a lot of logic behind this besides thinking it will follow the pattern unless something truly tragic happens.

It is my conviction that every dollar thats ever touched btc will at some point want to be btc again.

Yall have any more of that NumberGoUp

Ngl I’m in a bit of shock. Cost basis $52k bought August 6th after yen carry trade, so just round tripped. I’m fine to hold for while, but the relentless selling something else. Guess it’s time to not check the screens until Monday
12
Still holding, but I think I over leveraged a bit back when it dropped from 72 to 64k.  I’ma cry if it doesn’t rebound because I refuse to sell for less than a profit, even if I have to wait a year or two.

That's not even a Bart, it's a Marge.

"extreme fear" on the index is surely a decent buy signal?

Good support here on the weekly charts. I posted a few days ago I thought the 53k area would be a possible low. I am buying for long term holding.

[Employment Situation report for August is out.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)..Unemployment rate for August came in at expectations set at 4.2%. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 142k, below expectations set at 164k. Additionally, nonfarm payrolls for July was revised down to 89k from 114k and nonfarm payrolls for June was revised down to 118k from 179k...[Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are now pricing in 59% odds of a 50 BP rate cut this month rather than a 25 BP rate cut, up from 40% odds yesterday...The national debt is currently growing by $1 trillion every ~100 days amidst the highest Fed funds rate in over two decades. Rate cuts will accelerate the money printing further and odds of larger rate cuts just increased. Regardless, only 450 new BTC will be mined per day...You are NOT bullish enough.

I’m a bear rn, but let me present both cases...[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JOBDmMpK/)..Bull: 50 week SMA acted as support again. Flip/hold $53k and then retest $56k level (assuming stock market doesn’t shit the bed)..Bear: Look back at previous cycles and you’ll see that BTC usually retests the 100 week SMA mid-cycle. It’s currently approaching $40k and will keep climbing, but look out below for that test if the $49k wick from Aug 5 doesn’t hold sometime this weekend/next week

Spot ETF’s have now had 7 consecutive trading days of net outflows, matching the record. The past 7 trading days have seen a total of $1.0159 billion in net outflows from spot ETF’s. 7 consecutive trading days of net outflows first occurred from April 24th to May 2nd totaling $1.2231 billion in net outflows and 7 consecutive trading days of net outflows occurred again from June 13th to June 24th totaling $1.1347 billion in net outflows...Once prior long strings of consecutive spot ETF net outflows came to an end, they were shortly followed by an even longer string of consecutive spot ETF net inflows. After May 2nd, spot ETF’s had a record 19 consecutive trading days of net inflows from May 13th through June 7th totaling $4.004 billion in net inflows. After June 24th, spot ETF’s had 12 consecutive trading days of net inflows from July 5th through July 22nd totaling $2.9177 billion in net inflows...Not sure when consecutive net outflows will come to an end but statistically speaking, it should be fairly soon. Also, statistically speaking, once the long string of consecutive outflows comes to an end, it should be followed by an even longer string of consecutive net inflows beginning within a couple of weeks...Will this pattern continue or will it come to an end? We’ll see.

The fed is cutting rates in 11 days, and again later in the year, starting the risk on bacchanalia again, and you are selling?  You aren't gonna make it.  ..The fed just stopped *raising* rates in Sept. 2023 and BTC took off.  What will it do when they actually cut?..  .Sept. 2020 is when BTC started taking off before the last bull year of 2021 and you are going to miss it again because you read this thread and look at the short time frame charts too much.  Look at the charts.  It's all going to happen again...Exactly like they planned.  And you talked yourself out of it again somehow.  You are **so scared** that the four year cycle is over.  How about letting it prove it is over first?  Set yourself an alert and sell Nov. 2025.  You will be glad you did.
11
It's starting to feel like the bull run is over and all these other narratives like "as soon as the feds cut the rates..." are just us trying to convince each other and hold onto hope

FFS guys, calm down and zoom out:..[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ahJ4nvx0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ahJ4nvx0/)..This cycle is playing out just the same as the two previous cycles. Sure, there are anomalies: June 2019 overheated pump (back to expected by year end), C19 crash (and recovered really quickly), 2021 cut short (got my theory about that: C19 knock-on), Feb 2024 ETF pump (so hit ATH early)...Don't expect much until mid Oct. Keep on stacking.

What could cause a bunch of buying to suddenly occur? Unemployment rate for August coming in above expectations which would increase the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates by 50 BP in September rather than 25 BP, accelerating the money printer more than expected. [Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are currently pricing in 43% odds of a 50 BP rate cut rather than a 25 BP rate cut this month...Expectations for August’s unemployment rate are currently set at 4.2% even though July’s unemployment rate came in at 4.3%. Also, unemployment rate came in above expectations for the past 4 months. Unemployment coming in above expectations seems likely given how low expectations are currently set in combination with trajectory of reports for the past few months...Will unemployment come in above expectations? If so, will the increased likelihood of a 50 BP rate cut in September ultimately result in quick upwards price movement for BTC? We’ll see.

Aside from nonfarm payrolls coming in below expectations this morning, did some other major macro news come out that I’m unaware of?..Yesterday [futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) were pricing in 40% odds of a 50 BP rate cut in September. Immediately after the lackluster employment news broke out, odds of a 50 BP rate cut jumped to 59%. Makes sense. Now, a couple hours later, futures are showing only 23% odds of a 50 BP rate cut...What am I missing? Did someone from the Fed explicitly state anything suggesting we should only anticipate a 25 BP rate cut? Fed Governor Waller literally just came out today saying they’re [open to a larger cut in September.](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/fed-governor-waller-backs-interest-rate-cut-at-september-meeting.html)..I’m not saying market has to move in the way I expected it to, but what is causing futures to think a 50 BP rate cut is less likely now rather than more likely?

On the hourly, it looks like BTC likes the employment report so far. We’ll see what happens as the market opens...On the daily, BTC’s RSI is currently 41.8 and its average is currently 46.5. Major resistances are 57.5, 63 and 69, with a lot on minor ones in between. The nearest major supports is 50 with minor supports 56.5, 55.7, 54.5 and 52.9. The 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA are 51411/62617/63845 and may act as resistance/support as BTC moves up. A fat falling wedge has formed...The RSI on the weekly is currently 46.8 (54.3 average). It has been in widening wedge/flag formation since March with multiple touches on the top and bottom. It is currently near the middle of the flag. Looking for a strong close above the flag on the weekly for confirmation of a breakout. If this is a confirmed continuation pattern, the target would be above 100k. An IH&S is starting to form with the current move back up. I don’t like the a-symmetry of it, but it technically is starting to meet the pattern. Main resistances were noted above...Bitcoin closed August out in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 60.8. Current RSI 62.3. September may end in the green. The 4^(th) month after halving is usually green. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a coincidence, but with the FED now easing, the money printers are being turned up higher...Good luck to all traders and DCAers...Hourly:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/m5nTevZf/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/m5nTevZf/)..Daily:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/qJjOTB35/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qJjOTB35/)..Weekly Zoomed:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/QRFtHSXe/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QRFtHSXe/)..Weekly:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/s2yQ9ljN/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/s2yQ9ljN/)..Monthly:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/nZdrDRqP/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nZdrDRqP/)

Someone wrote in an earlier post: "So we're on pace for this halving to do about 1X, or no change. We are hitting the flat part of the rainbow."..This is what many invested in BTC and crypto deep down dread. I would by lying through my teeth if I was saying I was not acutely worried about this prospect at this very moment. Is it possible that this asset, whatever it is capable of or represents, can become bogged down, purely by a worsening crisis of confidence so-to-speak, that eventually spills over into an accelerating price decline?..Surely, once the realisation were to set in that this cycle, for whatever reasons, is underperforming the last one, some sense of panic would set in, even among veteran BTC holders?..The fundamental problem I see is that real world adoption and use, other than for speculative purposes, is still negligible. Stablecoins can be used for quick transfers of cash while several central banks are preparing the launch of CBDCs. The roll-out of AI for the average consumer has shown the world what lightning fast adoption in the digital realm can mean. And here we are, some 16 years after BTC was invented and its relevance and footprint, for lack of a better word, in most people's lives does not look radically different than back then...I am therefore quite concerned that this bull run could come as an even greater disappointment than the last one, and in doing so, might herald the beginning some kind of a hibernation period for BTC or its slow fading into irrelevance...Thoughts, criticism, evidence that plausibly and easily explains why such fears are unfounded?

We also bounced off this range, loosely drawn here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TisTQkCI..We could reverse back to the top, and still get rejected of course. Or we could just breakdown over the weekend. We'll see.

I always have an upvote for those who buy & use cold storage.  This is the way.

This is the way to do it. I believe constantly looking at the charts becomes an obsession leading to depression, at least for me. It is better to either sell when reaching enough gains or just put in cold storage and forget about it. All my crypto is now in cold storage.

This will probably end with a pulling off of a Bandage moment and a big final capitulation red candle dump , but not until all the retail bulls capitulate first and give up. Too many are still calling bottoms since 60ks and buying every dip still. The end of a major downtrend usually coincides with a ripping of a bandage moment. But  until then , the corn likely continues the downward slope in a Wyckoff distribution pattern

Ah yes, here we are back at the price level of.... oh, ONE month ago...

Perhaps if you have to wait until payday you’ll get a better deal given the weekly down trend.  It’s like every week is statistically more likely to see lower prices. ..I don’t particularly enjoy the opportunity to purchase lower.  I only really enjoy price movements when the direction is up.

I remember reading the same questions, and various speculations as to possible answers, on Kitco and other gold forums. A frequent explanation there was that the price of physical gold (and silver) was being suppressed by "paper gold" trading. Some opined that some day, price discovery would blow the manipulations by central and commercial banks out of the water. Eventually I lost interest in the entire sector because of the stagnant aura it exuded and because I realised that outsized gains were not achievable for ordinary people with no advanced knowledge in trading...The longer BTC continues to underperform vs. traditional markets, in spite of the many characteristics that would suggest that, if anything, it should in fact excel, the more my suspicion grows that this asset has fallen victim to some form of control or corruption by higher powers that set out to defuse the threat it once represented to their interests.
5
I cry and puke a little.

A highly upvoted opinion here is that ETFs will make it so that there wont be long bear markets because of too many buyers. Such a weird take. Now you can see the real effects when the bear market starts, if it hasnt already seing we have been in one for six months. ETFs sell even more than regular folks. ETFs wont change the cycles imo
0
I’m beholden to TradFi hours still but I’m going to add at 52k and will start leverage after a volume retest below 50...This is low volume PA. It’s shitty PA, but it’s relatively low volume. No podracing here.
7
a lot of people are planning to buy at 0, so I'm gonna front-run them at 25 cents
3
I dont trade but I (as a bear) think the dump continues to about $42k at which point then BTC rips to $58k...Then decision time...if right translated 4 year cycle theory is correct, its up and up printing new ATH where as if the left translated theory is correct then its down, down, down...

I feel the same way, and still believe in Bitcoin long term. So while taking some off the table would be wise, I'm gonna sit this one out like I did all of them before. It has always paid off, but boy does it hurt.

If you are a 2013 veteran, you shouldn't have losses.  Lessened gains seem like losses but in the US are taxed as gains.

I'm buying 51 to 42 in a ladder. I think there's a good chance some will hit but not all

Similar, got orders every 1000 down to 40k been on the books for months now, ..If it goes down, my stack increases, I'm happy. If it goes up, the value of my stack increases, i,m happier.  ..It's a win win, whatever  the price does. If it stays at current  levels for a fee years, that would be somewhat  frustrating.

I've got a bitty bot prediction of us breaking that low by end of the month, but not sure if it will hit tbh..I also have a bitty bot prediction of us hitting 75k in a week lolol

I called for 53k today and 49k retest next week, but this is even shocking me. Unreal weakness

Just walkin this down to the 40s 1k at a time. No rush.
1
All of these "calm down and chill" don't worry posts reaks of complacency and has been this way since high 60ks. Until the thread stops being an echo chamber of copium, it'll likely keep slow bleeding down...I'll know a buyable bottom is achieved once I see a high volume capitulation and everyone convinced the cycle is "over" including some of our resident posters like moonboyrico give up..Everyone so hyper-fixated on this being a "bull market" so it can't go down, but in every bull market there has always been some sort of mid-cycle dump and fuckery to make us question our investment thesis.
7
One of the important anomalies is none of the other cycles had a sustained downtrend that 25-30% over several months after the halving. ..Another anomaly of this cycle could be that the part where the brief bull run that happens about a quarter way into the cycle doesn't happen this time but the rest of the cycle stays the same...  .First first halving increased by 100X..The second halving increased by 20X..The third halving increased about 7X..So we're on pace for this halving to do about 1X, or no change. We are hitting the flat part of the rainbow.

The example bars in your chart don’t resemble each other in the slightest...it is not an analysis if you just select ramdom bars

My take is that if the unemployment rate is higher than expected, then chances of an upcoming recession are higher. As you said, the FED will then likey cut the rates by 50 BP. But that will cause sell off in high risk assets, like tech stocks and probably also BTC...So, maybe lets hope for lower then expected unemployment rate?

sounds like hopium

How do we know it's Mt.Gox profit taking?

We’re in the part of the cycle where no news can pump the price. All of the FAANG companies could announce plans to buy all remaining bitcoin on all exchanges and put them in their books and idiots would still panic sell all their coins at a loss

The FED has been dangle rate cuts starting with 6 in the beginning of the year now down to possibly one, one big masterful distribution while stock allocation from the average household is the highest in 72 years. Add Blackrock pushing Bitcoin they're getting as many people as possible to pile into equities and crypto before the rug pull, evil. ..It's always been supply and demand but their goal is to leave the average person with the least amount of money possible through narratives and media manipulation. While the top .01 get more and more, that's always been the goal.

Great question! More for me please

If all goes as I expect it to, I'll have more by then, like every cycle I've traded. ..If it doesn't go as I expect it to, I'll have the same amount because I sold all I wanted to sell in the 50's and 60's in 2021 and then bought them back, and then some, in the 20's and 30's and I'm a patient man.
3
Haha, everyone's plan is for a big rise in Q4 maybe in Q1-Q2 2025 ideally something close to or above the 100k range then cash out and never look back, except for maybe a tiny portion left in the bag.
7
Less.
2
JAN2026: less.DEC2026: more..See all depends how you frame it
2
more
2
More...Spot ETF approval marked the beginning of the vertical portion of S-Curve adoption. Institutional fund managers who control tens of trillions of dollars did not have an easy way to gain exposure to BTC prior to this year. So, predictable 4 year cycles go out the window for at least a halving or two as fund managers spend the next several years trying to get to their target portfolio allocation, whatever that percentage amount ends up being...A lot of people will sell towards the end of 2025 thinking the bull market can’t possibly last much longer. But instead what will happen is the bull market will go much higher and last much longer than most are anticipating because fund managers will barely be wrapping up year 2 of being able to gain exposure to BTC. Also, many RIA’s still to this day don’t have the ability to gain exposure to spot ETF’s, that’s still forthcoming. So, those who sell towards end of 2025 will end up never being able to attain as much BTC as they once had.
-5
Certainly possible it ends up staying stagnant for a long while or even slowly fades into oblivion. That’s always a risk with any crypto, even Bitcoin...However, if it doesn’t do those things and actually becomes some sort of reserve asset that countries/companies/retail all want, then the sky really is the limit on price...Which is why bitcoin is such an asymmetrical bet. One that I think is a good bet, but certainly not guaranteed.
8
It's easy for traders to change their sentiment after a few days, weeks or months of red candles, but the general trend is still for Bitcoin to become established as a new kind of asset with gold-like characteristics, and the institutions that are joining us are slower moving in both directions. They are slower to adopt and slower to give up on it...  .Here's an example:..US banks are a bit behind on this, but I've been seeing many banks from other parts of the world start offering Bitcoin custody and trading this year. Here's an example from Switzerland from a few days ago:..[https://cointelegraph.com/news/zkb-swiss-bank-bitcoin-ether-crypto-trading](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zkb-swiss-bank-bitcoin-ether-crypto-trading)..Based on a quick web search, this is one of four banks in Switzerland that are deemed "systemically important", and it seems another one of those four (PostFinance) already offers crypto services as well...Now Switzerland may be a special case that cannot be generalized easily, but this shows that trends do not change that quickly. They and other Swiss banks probably laid these foundations during the bear market of 2022-2023 when you like many others were probably thinking Bitcoin was dead as well. Turns out writing it off that quickly is a little short-sighted. It now appears to be dying from a purely price-based perspective as well, but I can't see any signs of larger trends reversing...In addition to banks and ETFs (where many countries are following the US lead) making these things available, more regulatory clarity that is gained in the process, more investors using these new tools to access Bitcoin, there are other more subtle trends as well, such as younger generations having a higher affinity for crypto than older generations. As they inherit the world there should be an automatic reallocation that favors crypto more than it did before...It will still go up and down on shorter timescales, but the long term trends still appear to be firmly established.
8
We’ve simply run out of marginal buyers. Everyone here is just a survivor of previous cycles, and looking for a way out. Let’s all be honest with ourselves
4
I don't know if Bitcoin is the great investment it used to be. It's not new. You're not early. It's bull runs have gotten incredibly mild. It still drops and crashes every year. It's still far below it's high from 3 years ago. It still can't decouple from shitcoins...Crypto is unfortunately looking like stupid money at this point in time with most shitcoins down 95-99% from their ath and BTC down about 30% with stocks near high. Enthusiasm and interest in the space is totally gone. On a risk adjusted basis, BTC is losing its luster compared to magnificent 7 stonks...What's the next narrative if BTC can't rally post halving? As much as we may like to pretend otherwise, this asset has been mostly driven by hype - we had ETF hype (came and went), sentiment around the halving hype is focused on a magical q4 hopium rally, goalposts will probably shift again should that rally fail to come to fruition, then what is our next source of hype?
1
> The fundamental problem I see is that real world adoption and use, other than for speculative purposes, is still negligible...Well, Bitcoin was intentionally crippled. You can't have "real world adoption" with 1MB blocks. And you can't do anything "useful" with a 10 minute (avg.) waiting time, because any instant security is destroyed by RBF. And second layer solutions are still ridiculously complicated and flawed.
1
It makes sense to have been more bullish at 49k after a high volume dump, because it usually involves a combination of forced sellers and liquidations and usually results in a rapid recovery afterwards . but a slow bleed is just a low momentum and lack of buying pressure which is not good.
2
I guess that's the case for many of us
1
On a positive note, the crypto fear & greed index is now firmly in red territory with a reading of 22 ("extreme fear"). On somewhat larger timeframes (12h, 1d), the RSI is beginning to approach oversold levels. Another glimmer of hope might be seen in the fact that compared to 2021, when the weekly RSI also dropped precipitously, the price has shown greater resilience this time round...Having  that said, the fact that market seems to be intent on retesting 49K, where a relatively high volume bounce occurred in early August, is disappointing. If that level fails to hold, then IMHO 100K is out of the window as a realistic price target for this year, to say the least.

MSTR has cash flow. ..You’ll have exited before they do.

Average cost basis is $36.798k per BTC...Not sure how low BTC would have to fall to force selling but BTC fell as low as $15.5k in November 2022 and MSTR stock fell as low as $13.26 per share ($132.60 pre stock split) in December 2022 and no forced selling occurred.
12
Halving isn't the start of the cycle. Usually the low after the crash is considered the start...[https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-cycle-low](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-cycle-low)..Looks like it is right on schedule in comparison the last 2 cycles. ..But BTC already peak this cycle and it's nothing but bear because the cycle is broken. According to you post history. LOL.

Ok, then give me evidence of this dictation. Sounds like yet another “manipulation” gripe

In this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/XwhDcgc.png) showing the last few months' price action, the grey vertical areas are the NY trading hours. The orange ones are the Tokyo trading hours...Here's another [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/So3nK16.png) showing the last few weeks' price action...We can clearly see there's still some good price movements outside the NY hours...But overall you're right. The NY market hours definitely have more activities. Most of the vertical movements of both directions happen during the NY hours.
7
> price movement is basically dictated by derivatives ..Tail does not wag the dog.

What matters is not through which instruments is the BTC price dictated, it's which money. And yes, today there's infinitely more money in tradfi than in crypto.

Fed is very likely to cut rates. This is not the question anymore, and is why traders are now responding to different news. The tightening cycle is over. Bonds are now behaving as they should, which is as a hedge against the stock market. Rate decreases are meant to correspond with economic weakness. In a "healthy" market, ideally, prices go down to meet demand when the economy shows signs of weakness...The only thing in question is how much the economy has already been affected by the tightening policy up until this point, and whether the economic slowdown will actually be ameliorated by rate cuts at all. Bulls are hoping the cuts cause a pump. However, it seems market participants have shifted their indicators.  Instead of basing their trades on interest rate speculation (it is all but a certainty they will start cutting this month), they are looking at economic strength to signal whether valuations are fair given future growth expectations. These future growth expectations depend on how much damage has already been done by inflation and the ensuing rate hikes. ..-Victor Cobra

>Everyone and their mother seems to be so sure the rate cut is coming...For good reason. ..If you think the opposite, you can bet on it via Fed funds futures and options.

ok well they aren't hiking, but yes if they don't cut they're basically electing trump. I suspect we see the most moderate of outcomes- .25%

No, but I’ll rotate out other assets into coin at that point.  ..Leverage starts around 48k. I’ll liquidate my RSUs at 42k. ..Bonus should appear next week sometime...Edit: And yeah, still in position. I’ll eat the drop to avoid missing an after hours bump up once everyone is done fumbling.

> I don’t particularly enjoy the opportunity to purchase lower.

It builds character and a stomach of steel.
3
Unless there is massive money printing and debasement, my main scenario is that it repeats 2021 price action with a slightly higher high, around 85-90k. It might pierce 100k, but it won't be sustained. The trigger might be a low CPI print next week.
1
Or maybe it’s also that people largely aren’t that interested in it….and the everyday person’s buying power keeps diminishing over time. Especially during an economic slowdown, people have less money to spend on things and purchase speculative investments... People tend to expect that with more and more money printing, Bitcoin’s value is guaranteed to continue up in the long term. However, it still requires buyers in the first place. If we do see hyper inflation, it’s unlikely people will be worrying about buying Bitcoin, or able to, for that matter. .. If Bitcoin were really that valuable to places seeing extreme inflation, it wouldn’t be mostly tied to the U.S. stock market at this point. Major volume tends to happen only during the week during U.S. stock market hours, which demonstrates this. It’s really not that hard to see these things...  -Victor Cobra

As long as there are bulls there will be bears and the cycles continue. Just simple math really (sine waves). ETF can't do anything other than  help with market cap scaling to serious numbers(10tril and beyond).
6
If we do, I think it would be a quick wick. The 52.5k mark is where BTC consolidated for 2 weeks in February, before the move up to the ATH in March. ~~They~~ There could be some significate buying there...I'm beholden to USPS. Just waiting for a check in the mail, hope it gets here tomorrow so I can buy more at this level...[https://www.tradingview.com/x/9A1sg3zs/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9A1sg3zs/)

Xtal the name i trust (:..Im just looking for congruence with other traders to check my bias...You think we break 50? My bias is we hold for a bit. And then test 4Xk untested levels

I don't think i will have any capitol if the price goes back to zero ):

I have to downvote you since you typed bear ):..But I like your level at 42k..Not sure what you see at 58k that is special.
2
exactly..and it's too late to sell, like every cycle before

I'd tell that to the people who are pushing that as the turning point

Why the fuck would rate cuts be bearish. Are you fucking high?

such a scamp
3
It's not springing out of the ground on its own, you know.
2
I personally don’t think you’ll get that, in reference to a bottom that is obvious. That doesn’t tend to happen with mid cycle pullbacks at least, now if we are going full blown bear then yes
3
Another important anomaly to note for this cycle: we never had ETF's get approved, and have a run up to a new ATH before the halving happened. I feel as if that has shifted the goal posts and timelines for everyone. We could bleed back down to pre ETF levels, and still be on a good track for a bull market through EOY and into/through 2025...Its entirely too early to call this cycle over and as a 1x. But if nothing happens in the next 6-12 months, then i'm inclined to agree with you. But as we know in bitcoin world, thats an eternity.
8
The chart shows historical post halving PA to be pretty tame/flat or down. The real fireworks don't typically start until 6 months+ after the halving. His point is sound.
4
Stock market needs to factor in earnings in addition to monetary debasement so there’s more of a mixed reaction with equities. Whereas BTC is more of a pure play on monetary debasement since there’s no earnings to factor in. In an environment where unemployment is high and there’s recessionary fears but a lot of monetary debasement is going on to combat recessionary fears, BTC should outperform...Textbook definition of a recession is two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP. This occurred in Q1 and Q2 of 2020 as well as Q1 and Q2 of 2022...Think of the aftermath in both occurrences. In 2020, Fed was quick to slash rates and the aftermath was BTC outperforming equities by quite a lot once the assurance of a cooperative Fed was sealed. Whereas in 2022 the Fed had just started a long series of rate hikes despite two consecutive quarters of negative GDP and the aftermath was BTC underperforming equities by quite a lot once it was made clear that the Fed’s primary objective was to get inflation down...The Fed funds rate is now the highest it’s been in over two decades. Inflation is still well above the Fed’s target 2% rate yet rate cuts are arriving this month regardless. A 50 BP rate cut would provide further reassurance that if forced to choose between addressing high unemployment or high inflation but not both, the Fed will choose to address high unemployment. So, BTC should outperform equities in this environment.
4
It is. ..But at the moment the biggest kind of hopium is the level of total despair here.
6
Imagine when you lost your coins your cost basis was 500 dollars. Now it’s 100x and you’ve been sweating it out in a pizza shop for 10 years waiting to see if anything would ever come of it. What level would you sell at?

thats a liquidity issue unique to crypto exchanges due to a lack of circuit breakers. I base myself on close.

Major countries could announce that they're buying millions of Bitcoin and the price would drop.

Can you rationalize it?..What changed between yesterday and today that would suggest odds of a 50 BP rate cut this month are LESS likely rather than MORE likely than they were yesterday?

I’m not even talking about BTC price movement, I’m asking about futures specifically which impacts markets more broadly...After today’s data why would futures think odds of a 50 BP rate cut are LESS likely rather than MORE likely compared to yesterday? What am I missing?

If BTC does go green this month, it will look even more like last cycle.

Obviously 100k is a big milestone for a lot of people. As was 10k when we hit that. People said the same thing then. Selling all your bitcoin in 2025, unless you need the funds for retirement, or a big life purchase, etc, seems extremely short sighted. ..Unless you believe Bitcoin will cease to exist at some point. But for those of us that will sit on our corn for another 10-20-30 years... the price will very likely be magnitudes higher. Absolute scarcity is absolute.

Everyone? Who's everyone? Make a poll please.....Some people will sell it all, some others sell most, others sell little and some sell none. As usual?

You’ve just proved my point. Thank you. And good luck with that

Do you have stock comments saved so you can copy and paste? You say the exact same thing word for word weekly if not daily on multiple topics. You’ve spammed this sub for over a year so here’s my opinion on it...You shilled fucking vert coin for 4 years before coming here. Same thing, repeatedly saying how $x inflows would get vert above $1, then $5… it’s 6 cents...You went on and on in late ‘23 and early ‘24 with daily updates about the fed futures and how the first cut would occur in March ‘24 with 4-6 more cuts before the end of the year. First cut in Sept...Your ability to add $10,000 to the daily opening price and tell us the total is remarkable...Buying / selling being net zero outside of etfs is a fantasy. Mental masturbation doing meaningless arithmetic every week...Same with 1% of tradfi assets buying bitcoin with a bull market multiplier, then 2%, then 3%…..4 year cycles are out the window for at least a halving or two? So maybe 3, maybe 4, maybe up only forever, because that’s how markets and human psychology work. ..I’m familiar with the tech adoption curve and I think the etfs mark crossing the chasm for bitcoin, but other disruptive tech like telephone and internet didn’t make users wealthy. People will sell at least some of their bitcoin for things...My patience has been out the window for at least a quarter or two with all the copy paste and spam, along with what I perceive as an air of superiority and condescension talking down to the sub. eg “you’re NOT bullish enough” implying only you possess the intellect to foresee the ngu magnitude...Yesterday you said if etfs have net outflows it will tie the record and if today has net outflows it will break the record. Really appreciate the explanation of how records work. And so what if there are 8 days of net etf outflows? There could be a day of inflows and 8 more of outflows while a significant amount of volume takes place outside of etfs. The streak and ‘records’ are meaningless...Your presentation is odd too.. “btc is 27.9856% below ath” because 28% is way off.

Keep in mind a lot of their BTC was not purchased with debt, and some loans have already been repaid. So the average cost basis is not that important in terms of the debt.

Id rather be realistic and hope for the best but expect the worst than be posting incessant bulltard hopium about a supposed bull flag breakout that will take us to 100k any day now. "LOL"..I also NEVER have said that BTC is past its peak "this cycle"? But its a possibility that I'm willing to entertain...Some guy was in here the other day saying 73K was the top of last cycle - and he's right if you define a cycle to be halving to halving. The top from the 2020 halving cycle occurred in March 2024 - so according to YOUR theory (euphoria -> bubble -> bust) you should actually be the one calling for a bear market - but maybe its already started?..You're just another soothsayer who thinks the market works on your predetermined timeline and that things are occurring on some already defined schedule... "right on schedule" yet you don't believe the cycle starts at the halving date.
-1
No, but the dog only acts 9-4 so its clear it's only interested in manipulating the tails instruments...For me, there's still just nothing appealing here about where this market is headed. They got a good pump in to get the money in the instruments at least tho.

yes, not a believer of 40s still

I don't disagree with anything you have written and am expecting a rate cut but at the same I would just be amused to see the crowd of over leveraged bulls (in all markets) wrong...Owning BTC and other crypto has turned me into somewhat of a masochist. Obviously I would like to see the market rip while I'm in my 30s and retire early but I am not over leveraged and can afford to hold all of my holdings for 5-10+ years if need be. I am in no rush to see number go up. This attitude about the market helps me maintain sanity.

There were multiple 40% capitulations in 2017

Fair enough. Although Bitcoins definition of bear markets are typically very different then tradfi. And the cycle history would indicate this being more of an extended pull back before a post halving rally sometime in Q4 or 2025...Either way, the dramatic “this is the end” posts are ridiculous.

odds shot back up in favor of a 25 BP cut since he posted that so you're right there clearly is a lot of uncertainty.

no, that's not what you said. you said it, but added like 2 sentences of copium. not shaming you, that's okay we all get caught. 52k seemed like a good price back then.

If the historical pattern holds, ATH should fall between late 2025 and early 2026.
1
Back in 2021 after the first new ATH of $42k was printed after the sell off the second ATH was about $58k...A BTC Coinbase daily log chart on trading view with a horizontal line at $58k shows a fair few touches over the years...I must preface my comment by saying that I believe Wall Street pull the strings and they want people continue to believe in a right translated 4 year cycle peak whilst at the same time bringing the price down slowly...At $42k people will start to doubt so to keep them believing up we go to about $58k. Confidence will be restored and then like I said decision time, ATH or visit the 2022 lows…
2
True, but discussions like these are what gives me hope...  .You buy when there's blood on the streets. I see some dripping, but apparently not enough...  .INB4: That is, if you believe Bitcoin is here to stay. If someone believes otherwise, I assume they do not know enough about protocol, and their opinion has been proven over the years as surprisingly accurate inverse indicator.
1
Rate cuts themselves are not bearish. The *reason* for the rate cuts is bearish, namely that the economy is doing bad and people can't get jobs. It's hard for people to buy Bitcoin when they don't have a job and can't afford basic necessities. So while rate cuts themselves are good, I wouldn't expect a huge bounce upon their announcement because few people have extra money laying around right now to buy Bitcoin given the state of affairs. Once the economy eventually improves as a result of the rate cuts, though, then Bitcoin may benefit.
1
Man that goes for us both. I don't see how it goes down without major manipulation though, even if the stock market crashes all it would take is btc to rise at that time for everyone to jump ship and pump it to Valhalla. That's the perfect storm I'm looking for
0
maybe not, but what I'll be looking for is a slow-down of bearish momentum. maybe a W shaped bottom or something similar. ..Maybe not a clear capitulation dump candle and V shaped recovery, but once everything get's rinsed there may be a slowing of volatility and lowering of down-side momentum. But this slow bleed chop isn't it.
2
personally I would not have sold BTC but I get some people will. But most people would have chosen to sell at 60 or 70k over the last few months. It was significantly higher when those gox coins were distributed. Why wait? There are some being distributed still maybe but most have been distributed for a long time now...I’m not saying it’s not partly gox. But I don’t think that is the narrative here for this dip. This is probably more related to macro economic conditions. Because America being the center of the universe going into a recession means a global distributed ledger should collapse. Right?

>  hopium as a certainty..Good summary.

In fairness you gotta give it a few years to really see how impactful it is. Still a huge deal to have these ETFs, but I will admit the extrapolations did seem silly to me at the time
2
ETF inflow/outflow numbers – dopeboyrico's posts are relevant and I'm glad someone's tracking it for the sub. ..If people are taking his extrapolations as gospel and now are butt-hurt about it, that's on them.

This is my take as well. Baseless drivel recalculated and repeated daily. Insufferable.
2
His data was accurate. That’s what I appreciated. I did not state anything about extrapolations or conclusions—“data-based work that’s pertinent to trading Bitcoin.” I never trade off the conclusions of others; I only trade off my conclusions. Some posters on here influence my decisions, but it’s a fools game to follow the trading decisions of others.

you're describing the difference between traders and hodlers (which include maxis), really. ..Many ITT are here strictly for the fiat gains, and have no grasp on the other reasons to learn about or own btc.   They don't care about the distinction I made in my first sentence, either. ..They can't care if they are right or wrong, or even see another viewpoint, unless they have even casual interest in the subject matter.  .."Everyone buys bitcoin at the price they deserve."

Care to elaborate?

This. The standard copy pasted reply ick me too. On the other hand he's a permabull and nobody calls on them when corn go up. Guess it's the same as permabear having their time when corn go down.

1) I have frequently used base templates saved which I alter as data inputs change, yes. We also get pretty frequent similar questions thrown around here, so I often have responses to FAQ’s prepared in advance...2) Not going to discuss altcoins here...3) Despite Fed meeting only 3 more times for the remainder of the year, futures are still pricing in 52% odds of at least 125 BP in rate cuts by year end. So even though first rate cut isn’t arriving until September and is much later than I anticipated, odds are still looking decent that the equivalent of 5 separate 25 BP rate cuts will arrive by year end...4) I have no idea when first $10k single day God candle will arrive, I’m just eagerly anticipating it to occur, hopefully sometime sooner rather than later...5) Buying/selling net zero outside of spot ETF’s has happened after every single halving BTC has ever had; price doesn’t just magically double from where it was at halving without supply shock kicking in as net buyers outweigh net sellers. Spot ETF’s will just add fuel to the fire when this supply shock inevitably occurs again...6) Various initial allocation models for fund managers aren’t just some random percentage, they’re based off of what Fidelity already uses for their Asset Allocation ETF’s in Canada where the most conservative fund has a 1% allocation into BTC and the most aggressive fund has a 3% allocation into BTC. Since Fidelity is an industry leader, the assumption being made is that similar initial allocations will be made for fund managers here in the U.S. as well...7) While I do think predictable 4 year cycles go out the window for at least a halving or two as fund managers spend the next several years trying to get to their initial allocation, I do think ultimately we get back to primary driver behind PA being halving events. However, for at least a halving or two, I think spot ETF’s overtake halving events as the primary driver behind PA...8) Yes, some people will sell BTC and take profits along the way. We’re already seeing that now. This doesn’t change the fact that BTC is absolutely scarce and so, over time, more BTC ultimately ends up in possession of diamond hands who have no fiat price whatsoever at which they’d be willing to sell...9) I honestly don’t think majority of people in this sub are bullish enough. If you want to argue, go ahead and combat your investment thesis with mine and explain why your investment thesis is superior. Exchange of ideas is kind of the whole point here...10) I enjoy data. When data inputs set new records, match, or break previous trends I enjoy taking note of such occurrences. Many people use this subreddit as a way to gather a bunch of developing information surrounding BTC so I chime in with data inputs I collect for myself periodically incase others care to know as well...11) Sometimes when I’m copying data over into a comment here it’s easier to copy verbatim versus going back and revising to round a data point up or down...Thanks for your questions/comments/concerns, feel free to share anything else.

It was actually sub $1 in 2010 if my memory serves me correctly... but we've flatlined for the last 3.5 years.  .  .Right now it's September 2024 and price is at $54K after reaching $73K in March 2024. So for at least six months, the trend has been down. It was also $19K in December 2017 and $15K in December 2022, with various uptrends and downtrends in between. Maybe we just range 30-70K for the rest of the decade? I don't think its likely, but its a possibility.
1
Not hopium. Just basic TA. I've been very clear about my BTC expectations and BB my expectation of 100k by the new year. Not tomorrow. ..Realistic you are not. All you do is spout bearish things over and over, then add "I'm still long though" incase you are wrong on the bear shit. Then you don't have to eat crow. You can say you never sold and were right all along...Just for the record. I was bearish the majority of last year. So don't bring that "incessant bullish hopium" shit at me. You are the one pulling data from odd time frames to prove your cycle is dead point, even though it isn't the generally accepted timeframe for the cycle. I have no problem being wrong, I have noted it in the past. I don't try to prove my point by showing you oranges to prove that your apples are bad.

You get it too lol...Wall Street are gonna break retail and take their coins...Retail will give up because the narrative that they have been fed (4 year cycles) gets broken in 2025...I ask myself if Tim Cook has BTC for himself then how come all mega caps don't at least allocate some capital into this asset class. ..The answer I tell myself, is that its too expensive for them. Tough luck I hear some of you say! They should pay up I hear you say!..But no, the billionaire balllers on wall street will get their way, finesse the coins off retail and then paint green candle after green candle on the chart.

Nobody knows the future price that's for sure. The trend is numbers go up since inception though and that's all we got for the last 15 years..The 600k was an arbitrary number. It could be 80k or 900k in 2028 who knows....And i don't have a specific fixation with the future number.

ETFs are good but they are just an on ramp for demand, not a paradigm shifting source of demand. New ATHs in the future won’t disprove that notion. I think of it as a demand multiplier and thus utterly silly to extrapolate from during a demand surge.

But what is suddenly causing futures to think that larger rate cuts later this year are more likely than a larger rate cut this month?..What changed between yesterday and today?

Thats not the point loserboy… the fact that you people feel the need to out this shittalk is sad.

This is sarcasm right?

The root of my question was: do you plan on selling “the top” this time? Your answer (to me) indicates you (like almost everyone else) are targeting a crowded exit door. And it’s never that simple
1
Consensus viewpoint here and everywhere on crypto forums is that the bullrun will start sometime in the next three months and top out in the next 15. ..Therefore, everyone (myself) included is looking to sell sometime next year. This will dampen any bullrun before it even gets going.
0
There were, are and will be a tone of ups and downs .... But overall the halving will be the detrimental piece of the puzzle that few can understand. Cycles suffer deformities, yes... But eventually it will make another ATH. As it has always done.
1
Fair.
1
I hope you're right about 100K by EOY but I'm not seeing it. Yea, you're damn right I'm pretty bearish right now and disappointed with BTC, but I am also holding my spot position and have never sold a single sat. I'm wrong more often than I'm right so I don't try to trade...BTW: from everything that I have read online, the generally accepted timeline of the cycle is that the bullrun starts 6-12 months after the halving and peaks 12-18 months after. From what I recall in one of our earlier conversations, you seem to be the one relying on "odd time frames" to somehow assert that even though we peaked 46 months after the last halving, the cycle is still intact.

Yes of course..Sarcasm has a kernel of truth though. PoS pretty universally stands for piece of shit.

1
You're assuming a series of things, as I imagined:.- you think I plan to sell the top. I have a set target (actually more than one as it involves a combination of prices of both BTC and another shitcoin I hold) and plan to sell once it hits. Unfortunately I don't have a Crystal ball so I don't know if it will be reached or if we skyrocket past it. We'll see.- you think everyone is planning on selling the top: this is the ideal scenario but again nobody's got a crystal ball. Some will sell the bull run some others will once more baghold. Unless you're saying that selling the bull run is a crowded exit door, which doesn't make sense because it's what sane people do outside of the meme "buy high sell low" .- almost everyone else is planning on doing what you implied I was supposed to do which turned out to be make a profit on set targets which is a standard investment/trading strategy? I wonder how people ever make money...You got it right that it's never that simple which means that I will either miss unrealized profits or baghold unrealized loss. Which is...normal trading business? I mean unless this sub suddenly turned into r/cryptocurrency, your argument is basically "it's not really possible to sell when price go up and buy when go down".
5
Yes, but that's not the point. It's supposed to be an non correlated asset to protect and grow your wealth, the last couple of years does neither, behaves like a meme tech stock and hasn't outperformed mega cap stocks and indices, while it has 2-3 times greater volatility. That is a recipe for disaster

Compound interest is an actually guaranteed way to obtain wealth. Being all in on something super volatile just means you're more likely to due with nothing

What makes you think I am not already all in overexposed beyond my net-worth since late 2018? I don't do leverage beyond taking out actual loans. Liquidation targets aint no fun. Real men margin call themselves...No really, the recession is priced in.

And the rate cuts that we've known about since at least May aren't priced in? If the recession is priced in, then why has the price literally been tanking for the last 2 days. See also the stock market...But okay, you do you. The good thing about all this is that we will know in a week...It sounds like your overexposure is clouding your judgement, though, and you may want to reconsider that.

Slow grinds up and down are better.  Fast moves attracts the fomo leverage

So I'm on holiday and just checked the rates twice today to see around 56k, and a lot of my investment being evaporated. Honestly, I don't care at this point about the weekly highs or lows. The one thing that I am certain of is that I made the mistake of thinking BTC is dead back in 2018. I will NEVER make the same mistake again. I'll wait for 2025, then 2026, but I will remain long-term bullish no matter what happens in the short term. I don't have the cash to DCA or skills to do daily trades, so what's the point of worrying.
29
I think we had four 20+% drawdowns in the previous bull market, and eight in the one before that (the first, right after we had set a new ATH). So, if we compare to history, this isn’t that unusual. 
17
I'm tired boss
8
I suppose those of us who have been through a few cycles are lucky to be numb to price action like this. It’s always so frustrating when you know the bull run is coming but it just won’t come. ..Just imagine that bit ETF bump never happened and we’ve been grinding up and sideways since last October.
15
I was a bit puzzled seeing BitcoinDominance stable these days, then I realized stablecoins are included in the website  I used. This is a [chart with stable excluded](https://cryptoscope.cryptoatlas.net/BTCD.php).
7
Quick question if I may. Where are the best places to see the inflows and outflows of the different ETFs?
7
Q4 of 2024 will be a very interesting one for Bitcoin.   Here were the Bitcoin Q4 prices in 2020 (4 years ago)...1. Sep 1, 2020:  10.7K.2. Oct 1, 2020:  13.7K.3. Nov 1, 2020:  19.7K.4. Dec 1, 2020:  28.9K..Basically, Bitcoin went up close 200% in three months in Q4.  I don't expect Bitcoin to go up 200% this time around but lack of bull rally would lead to complaints and these would be legitimate complaints.  Given the 4 year cycle, the best way to measure Bitcoin's current price to the past price is to compare it with the price 4 years ago.  And the baseline (2020 price) for comparison will become much higher in the next few months.  And next year, the baseline (2021 price) will become even higher.  ..Bitcoin's report cards are going to come out pretty soon.
13
All noobs and skeptics are being shown every reason to disembark the rocket before it takes off. It's almost too obvious it's going to fall off a cliff, and it might. But I don't think there is a whole lot of time left to play chicken with the god candles coming our way. ..BTC crabs and droops until it doesn't, and then the narratives change on a dime too. Don't get caught
23
Remember the good ol' days when BTC was over $60,000 all the time and a new ATH was imminent and we got daily cut and paste hopium calculating the 6-figure BTC amount when ETFs caused liquidity to evaporate, when we knew that the Fed's mere announcement of rate cuts would finally lead to the next leg up?...And then none of that happened.
24
I like when the daily closes, so I can see green on my screen for a few hours at least. 📗(+0.02%)

Maybe the price will go back up
9
It's down only until it isn't. Stay in position, fellas...Bitcoin is at 57k still, pretty insane to be at this level for over 6 months.
12
I see three categories of comments right now:..Copium..Hopium..Nopium
15
This is getting far too comfortable in the 50's. This was the same slow drift we had a few months ago when 70ks became resistance we drifted in the 60's for awhile. Now, 60k resistance is the new 70k.
9
Send it to $40k. Time to rip the bandage off
12
Must be getting close to the bottom with all the up-votes on doom and gloom posts.
10
I guess tomorrow is the big one with the US unemployment data which will determine whether we dip to low 50's or possibly below or finally get a trend reversal..But it's getting quite confusing how Tradfi interprets this data in regards to risk on assets.
7
Sentiment here changes quicker than high & low tide.. (im still bullish and will remain so)
8
I wanted to add some substantiation to my claims of $53k in the next 24hrs and $49k by next week. ..[Chart for reference](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gG3IeFyb/)..We’re about to lose the $56k level. Nothing but air below. CPI tomorrow will be the proverbial dagger. ..Hot CPI: BTC dumps with everything else because of macro uncertainty ..Cold CPI: BTC dumps because tradfi rips and Bitcoin becomes a further useless investment instrument in a low-inflation environment ..Chop into the weekend (per usual). Then bottom falls out and we see if $49k was the bottom or not…..Obviously I hope to be wrong. But I’ve been adamant that we’re in a bear market. Sorry, folks.
11
if you zoom out it looks like it wants to retest the 50k zone. But i doubt it will stay down there long if it falls. isn't it already trading way below the cost to mine?
3
Pro tip for the newish posters on here: study the historical charts for a while prior to telling us you haven’t without stating that you haven’t when making historical PA comparisons and contrasts. Don’t merely do it for cred, do it to avoid losing wealth and/or miss opportunities to grow or preserve wealth.
8
The moment you realize that everybody is talking about a recession. The recession is almost over.

high vol up and then low vol give up...

I’m going into leverage the farm and accumulate spot mode soon...Bitcoins big moves are never gradual...Debt is still being racked up...Hard hands are on the other end of the distributions.
9
I’m convinced we need a bear version of dopeboyrico. Someone giving us that sweet $20k inverse cup and balls TA everyday. Then maybe we can go up
12
One thing that is concerning is that S&P500 is still just 3-4% away from its ATH level.  The stock market hasn't had a correction at all so there is much more room to fall.  And if it does undergo serious correction, Bitcoin is not escaping a dump.
12
Apparently great depressions are bad for the price of Corn. Interesting
6
Man, I have some serious doubts about Bitcoin and still don’t plan on buying any, but sentiment in here is almost making me want to become bullish again. Just overlay the 2018-2021 chart onto 2022-2025 and you’ll see that Bitcoin is way ahead of where it was price wise back then. A drop below $40k from here wouldn’t be out of the question. What’s actually spooking people seems to be any number of the following:..1) Economic slowdown in the U.S. leading to a possible recession...2) Tech bubble finally bursting due to the dwindling AI hype...3) Bitcoin’s relative performance to some other assets over the last few years. ..4) Diminishing returns. ..I do think the ETF’s are the final indicator for Bitcoin’s true demand. Probably the greatest risk is people just losing interest and moving on. That’s what I’m also getting from this sub - a larger dissatisfaction with returns from people who have been in the game a long time. If enough people give up, Bitcoin fades from the zeitgeist. If this happens, there won’t be a huge impact on society at all. That’s what makes it a gamble - it’s not intertwined with the financial system enough to be of significant real world necessity. You’re speculating that eventually it will due to endless money printing. Another assumption here is that money printing will continue ad nauseam. It is apparently not even thinkable that other economic policies may be adopted, or that other circumstances would change. A solution in search of a catastrophe. ..-Victor Cobra

Someone bittybot me for sub-$45k by November 1st. Long term chart, I get the feeling we'll be visiting those nether regions.

Would they really let the economy collapse in an indisputable way right before the election takes place?

We are currently testing the lowest weekly close we've had since the ATH. Not sure how significant that pretty arbitrary number is, but it did hold yesterday...

I sold (my Celsius payout) so now btc can send it
5
The difference between us and the whales is that if Bitcoin drops a lot, it isn't really opportunity for us because we don't have a lot of cash lying around as they are already in.  Whereas whales can procure hundreds of million dollars and take advantage of the dips.  This misalignment between people who have the money to really move the market vs retailers like ourselves might be one reason why Bitcoin doesn't go up exponentially and just keeps on oscillating back and forth with whales making killers during all the ups and downs.

Never been a time like this in crypto I can remember. We now dump when the Nikkei dumps. Trying to remain positive but it really doesn’t look good.

Every investor has to decide, whether they want to or not, on a pull number. The jobs report comes out tomorrow and the indication is that it has cooled further. .We are close to having to call it what it is: Recession. .People are not fond of risk assets during a recession, they want to keep money and feel safe. It’s still, unfortunately, a fiat-world. .It will take experiences like this for BTC to fully mature. .Having diamond hands doesn’t mean not facing reality.

Another day where "today's low is tomorrow's high" continues to be accurate
3
Spot ETF’s have now had 6 consecutive trading days of net outflows. The record is 7 consecutive trading days from April 24th to May 2nd and 7 consecutive trading days again from June 13 to June 24th...Once prior long strings of consecutive spot ETF net outflows came to an end, they were shortly followed by an even longer string of consecutive spot ETF net inflows. After May 2nd, spot ETF’s had a record 19 consecutive trading days of net inflows from May 13th through June 7th. After June 24th, spot ETF’s had 12 consecutive trading days of net inflows from July 5th through July 22nd...If today ends up being a net outflow day, it will match the previous record. If tomorrow also ends up being a net outflow day, a new record will be set. Not sure when consecutive net outflows will come to an end but statistically speaking, it should be fairly soon. Also, statistically speaking, once the long string of consecutive outflows comes to an end, it should be followed by an even longer string of consecutive net inflows beginning within a couple of weeks...Will this pattern continue or will it come to an end? We’ll see.

Next stop 54 seems completely guaranteed. This is such a long downtrend

Short term (hourly view) TA: we should catch a bounce on lower TF soon. MFI+RSI printed a buy signal on the hourly and those on the lower timeframes usually play out quickly. My guess is it’ll only be a scalpable bounce if you long it. If you’re looking to short, you’re better off waiting on the bounce for a better entry...Edit: PA is currently finding horizontal support from yesterday’s hourly candles as well.

So much for supply shock eh?

Wake me up when September ends...If the Uptober meme hopium doesn't materialize bulls will be scrambling for narratives.

Unemployment numbers come out today. If they’re high it might give a clue as to what size cut the Fed will do. A supersized cut will rocket coin. A quarter cut and it’ll probably dump. So if the unemployment numbers come in higher than expected today and tomorrow which is non farm numbers we should pump

I think we see $53,600 by week’s end. Chop over the weekend. Then crucial revisit of $49k lows next week

I just wonder when bitcoin moves closer in on the risk curve (if ever). It’s very clear this is not a serious asset class when it comes to shielding macro headwinds (yet). 5 years? 10? Never?

I think a lot of people were uncertain if it would ever come back from 2018.   Especially if that was their first cycle.  I ignored it until it started hitting mainstream news headlines but by then it was too late.  ..Took me two cycles but I'm with you.

How many of those downturns took 6 months to take a new high...?

Exactly. People need to chill the f out here and look at the charts from previous cycles. We're exactly where we should be. Liquidity is coming. Sit tight and don't do anything until minimum next year.

1
Well you're definitely wrong because CPI doesn't come out tomorrow.... Are you thinking of the unemployment report?

Unfortunately, I believe your appraisal of the situation is spot on. Since late 2018, BTC has never failed to disappoint high hopes, except for this spring perhaps, when the last ATH was exceeded prior to the halving, albeit by a fine margin only. Whatever image improvement (for lack of a better term) resulted from this feat has however long been burnt through during this more than dysmal summer...Hence, I expect this boring phase to end with a bang to the downside, and a retest of 49K over the coming week or so, which would result in breakdown of the weekly RSI from the current level in the mid 40s, even though the weekly RSI has been in decline since 11 December 2023, if we disregard a short upward excursion between Feb 26 and April 1. It is all just pretty pathetic, no matter how you want to slice it. This dreadful chart just reeks of fear and price weakness, let's get it over with...Edit: One could argue against this view that in spring/summer of 2021, the decline in the weekly RSI was comparable to what we have been witnessing now but that in contrast, the price has shown greater resilience this time round. In the absence of a systemic shock event, there is really not that much more scope for the weekly RSI to fall IMHO. In an unrealistically ideal world, which many BTCers have stopped believing in, a retest of 49K would be followed by a swift recovery and a gradual upward decoupling from other markets.
1
And then the week after powell says he is bearish on the economy and is slapping a 50bps rate cut to shore things up...We have to wait and see how the market react, I think it will be bearish.

So everybody should be going short bout now right?
5
I agree. I expect chop so shorting is not an easy trade here, but if/when the local bottom around 56k gives out I see 45k as a next stop..The chart is bearish on high timeframes and the economy is cooling. I'm sure there will be opportunities to long coming up, just not necessarily here.

>is almost making me want to become bullish again..Dear god please no, then we'll all know it's over for good.
19
Upvote for a thought out discussion starter, even though I disagree with some of the premises...Chief one being, there's no end in sight to fiat printing with the current econ and every extra trillion devalues the existing money bit by bit (pun intended). No such issue with BTC, nor other limited assets like gold, and while BTC can be sent to the other side of the world in minutes, gold cannot...I wouldn't (yet) go so far as to predict that BTC would replace the fiat system, but it seems that it's starting to take its place as a mainstream asset at the very least.
16
Your argument contains numerous assumptions and points that are questionable and, at best, highly debatable...For instance, the premise that everyone will take their ball and go home soon has been used for years. Or "it's not big enough to not fail yet, so it will likely fail" is kind of absurd.
13
i keep thinking that just because bitcoin COULD solve the problems of fiat currency, doesnt mean that it WILL. its just one possible option. nothing is inevitable
4
Thank you for your bearish oriented analysis. While long term bullish, I agree with you that such current bearish sentiment is a very good thing for the price to break above previous levels later in the cycle.

I have a ton of capital always ready to throw at bitcoin. An emergency, emergency stash. We are nowhere near close to those kind of levels imo tho. ..Just uncertainty rn, price discovery and they’ll manipulate it short term either way to liquidate.
10
not sure I agree. liquidity planning is foundational to effective capital allocation. whales, whether UHNWIs or (most) institutions, can't just print out of thin air, and believe it or not - are forced to play by the same rules...another logical fallacy here seems to be that whales somehow always make good calls, and their scalps have a 100% hit rate. Look at Buffet's premature exit from Apple.
10
One can always go for 100x leverage... /s..But really, it's all relative. A 5% increase is a 5% increase regardless, so you can benefit from the market movements in the same way, if you time your entries and exits right...Of course if you're just hodling, then all this is mostly irrelevant.

ETF have been a poor metric to follow.  Even if you do follow it, then if you take out the first quarter when there was hype and higher inflows, the last 5 months have averaged much lower. ..If we use your ‘equilibrium price’ model where buying and selling outside ETFs becomes neutral, then inflows for the last 5 months aren’t even enough to swallow up the daily mining reward.  So the fair price using your model would be even lower than we are now.  Useless metric

I'll likely get down voted, but I'm still betting we will see the 40s during September. Could be a good buying opportunity

1
We've been above 70k five times since ATH. Last time was 39 days ago.
8
How many of those downturns had ETF approvals in the USA?
3
Bullish bull market action IMO is making a new ATH that was years in the making. Then there is a sell off so that the previous ATH holds as support and then a new ATH is printed, example.....Print new ATH > retest previous ATH > ATH > sell off > ATH > sell off > parabolic blow off top ATH > Then start the bear market...Or something like that lol...What BTC has done is printed a $69k ATH in November 2021 and then entered into a bear market. BTC broke the ATH in March 2024 and printed a new ATH of $73k just a few days later. Since then BTC has just sold off for over 5 months straight! Total disrespect shown to previous ATH of $69k...How’s is that bullish, its not IMO...But if the 4 year cycle crew want to believe in 2025 that’s cool, according to a Bob Loukas tweet on July 30th he said expect new ATH around the middle of September, so not long to go, right lads?..[https://x.com/BobLoukas/status/1818273300335960423](https://x.com/BobLoukas/status/1818273300335960423)..Wait till he starts mentioning LEFT TRANSLATED…..SHIIIIIEEEEEEEEEETTT
3
I just look at it as an opportunity to focus on other things. Because once it heats up, none of us will be able to look away.

I can’t see what triggers the insane run up. Interest in Bitcoin has dwindled. ..The ETF’s could have been the final level. Nothing left to inspire the buy volume.

You forgot the classic blue waffle

My point still stands.

How else would you show Oct monthly increase from previous month without September tho? But yeah not q4
1
>as much as most people in here like to think they’re not correlated...This is always a head scratcher for me, because correlation is just a math equation and math is not debatable. But people will argue about it for hours...I think most people look at 2 charts and guess, instead of doing the math, but that's just not how correlation works. Not to mention it is constantly changing...Current 30-day BTC Correlation with QQQ = 0.35 (In August it was as low as -0.80)
8
I think the tighter correlation is with stock market traders, as you can see how the Bitcoin Market Price is heavily dumping all gains made during weekends and times between the market closing and opening. It didn't use to be like this, I think even pre-ETF times it wasn't like this, at least not this drastic.

I get it. I won't disparage anyone making their own choices.

It really depends on how the FED is going to handle the bulk of the CME refis that are due. A lot of them will be underwater from a valuation perspective. They have been handling them OK so far. This would affect regional and local banks more that the big ones due to the fact that they have a higher exposure to them.

An investment in a tool needs a purpose. Otherwise it’s just a gamble. Why do I need Bitcoin right now? If it’s only about something that *may* happen in the future, then it’s speculation. The response in here tends to be, “well if you don’t have any bitcoin, you’re also speculating.” Similarly, you’re pointing out assumptions I’m making myself, without addressing the concerns themselves.  I’m not even assuming these things WILL happen. I really made a couple of objective statements. 1) Bitcoin is currently not a necessity. 2) if enough people give up, people won’t talk about it much in the future. Hard to argue with that. If 90% of current holders abandoned ship, it’s unlikely to go anywhere.  Dismissing what I have to say as “absurd” without saying why is not enough, to be honest. I generally like you, but you seem very entrenched in your views at the moment.  ..-Victor Cobra

BTC has monetary characteristics that nothing else has. Plenty of those characteristics are likely highly beneficial and a "hedge" to fiat currency. Game theory suggests it should acquire an uncertain piece of the pie.

A lot of overleveraged longs got wiped out with the brief plunge to $49.1k...We would need pretty significant selling pressure all at once to get down to the $40k’s and with rate cuts looming which will result in accelerated money printing I don’t see that happening but I’d be happy to continue my routine DCA should such an opportunity arise.

We’re living in a world in which there’s hundreds of trillions of dollars of capital allocated into a wide array of assets where BTC makes up just $1 trillion of the big picture...There’s an enormous amount of upside potential for BTC remaining even without factoring in continued money printing which will be accelerating soon once the Fed begins cutting rates.

Yea, but comparing this drawdown to the ones in the past and saying it's par for the course is a bit disingenuous since BTC hasn't actually made a new ATH in six months...In all previous bull market correction, BTC was going six months between ATHs while making lower lows the entire time.

Am I a bad person for halfway hoping for a massive recession since I have yet to ever buy property and have rented/moved around? A part of me kinda hopes that that happens and I get what I want for cheap. Instead of a 30 year mortgage, just pay it off in 3-5 years like a car loan or buy it outright (or lock in that price with the 30 year mortgage as a non-inflating value).

QQQ is down almost 10% from it's ATH, NVDA around 20%. I'm not one to play the correlation game, but the graph overlapping the BTC and NVDA chart looked pretty close...until earlier this year of course. BTC certainly has a chance to outperform a bit before the end of the year. I'm personally leaning that way.
3
I generally like you to bro, but I also just call it as I see it. It's true that BTC is merely just a protocol, and a person really needs to understand (or at least believe) quite a few things about BTC itself, what money actually is/means, and how monetary policies work around the world, to get the crazy idea buy some real estate on a ledger they can't physically touch...I could make many valid points as to why lots of people would need bitcoin right now, or even how EVERYONE needs it. There are just as many reasons why they don't have BTC either, and may buy it in the future for reasons other than pure speculation. ..The premise of "if enough people give up" is impossible to argue with. There were many times when people "gave up" and the price plummeted. What has happened each and every time so far, except the last 6 months? New buyers, or the same people that originally sold, come back in and bump the price higher...There is infinite fiat and only a scarce amount of corn. I feel like you need to ask yourself how bitcoin got this far in just about 15 years. It's gone through some SHIT too. You know this. ..The 4 points you listed previous could turn around in a single year or less.

You need it to protect your savings against the infinite amount of money that sits in the central banks (BRRRRR) and to take care of your own savings without relying on banks*..*On the long run: 5 year financial plan required, doesn't apply if you're unable to save

It's just for a bittybot prediction. I thought it was funny since he calls people out when they make bold predictions about the price.
2
Due to the size of the cup (29 months). The handle would be between 1/6 (4.8 months) and 1/4 (7.25 months) the length of the cup. BTC is right in the middle of those. That is one of the reasons the bulls are excited about later this month early next month...The handle depth "usually" takes 1/3 height of the cup. The cup is $55.8k tall. That would make a retrace of $18.5k from ATH. This equals 52.7k. BTC wicked below that momentarily but didn't stay long enough to invalidate the pattern IMO.

If you bought on day 1 of a month and sold on the last day, you would only lose 3 of the last 6 months

Nope, I'm sure a lot actually hope for the same thing. Unfortunately if you look at the housing start charts yearly going back to the years of the great recession. You will see that we have never reached yearly housing starts that we use to have. ...This is why house prices have risen so much, we are currently millions of houses short in supply. Once you add this to the COVID years, when a lot just didn't want people in their house so didn't sell. Just added more to supply shock and prices....Of course it really doesn't matter who is president next, neither can really fix this problem, only time can.

I’ve been DCAing consistently into BTC since early 2017. No trading, no leverage, just DCA and HODL...I started gaining some degree of notoriety as a regular in this particular subreddit a couple years ago for my permabull stance throughout the 2022 bear market where I was wrong for an entire year and for my permabull stance through the 2023 recovery where I was right for an entire year...What caught a lot of people off guard was my call for new ATH before the halving for the first time ever back when people were still questioning whether or not spot ETF’s would get approved. Then once they were approved people were proclaiming spot ETF’s as “priced in” as if we’ve never heard that phrase before around BTC halvings. Now, yet again, we have some people who think the halving is “priced in” as if there isn’t any evidence which suggests it takes a few months for supply shock to kick in every single time. In addition to that we have a bunch of people thinking the glory days of spot ETF inflows are behind us when they’ve been around for only 8 months now...Only real takeaway I’ve had over the years is vast majority of people in BTC are not nearly as bullish as they should be and permabears ALWAYS get rekt given enough time whereas permabulls ALWAYS get rewarded given enough time...Screw being humble, BTC will ultimately become global unit of account and it will probably occur much quicker than most people expect. You are NOT bullish enough.

There's been tons of articles about it, obviously people can be lying but one such article mentioned an informal survey with 55% holding it all, 19% selling it all, and the rest selling some:..[https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6698f3c7ab0943321003fbd7/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6698f3c7ab0943321003fbd7/)..  .This article cites on chain analysis showing recipients transferring to cold storage:..[https://decrypt.co/241471/mt-gox-bitcoin-hodl-fold-selloff-fears-experts](https://decrypt.co/241471/mt-gox-bitcoin-hodl-fold-selloff-fears-experts)..  .I think a few months ago ahead of the repayment, everyone was hoping the recipients would hodl. Now that the price is down everyone is hoping that they all already sold. But most data and online comments from recipients did suggest they planned to sell very little.

Nothing will drill you down faster on the WHY, than [the white paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper).  It is the primary source.  ..If that is too dry, or not enough for you, then i recommend [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC43pZkpTec) ..Bitcoin is, yes, a cryptocurrency that you can trade for fiat gain.  If that is the limit of your interest, fair play...But if you truly want to see the appeal that you claim you wish to see... You will need research to help you understand.  Beyond the ETF,  there are fundamentals, many of which are explored in this video.

Hardly a revelation.  We’re all bullish long term, otherwise we wouldn’t be holding.  ..This is a trading sub. Bitcoin does spend an appreciable amount of time in downtrends.  Imo trading well isn’t about being a permabull or bear, but having the flexibility and insight to capitalise on the volatility 
2
Yeah I mean I wouldn't call 55% most. It's closer to half. 26% are selling some and 19% are selling all. 45% are selling. Those numbers make sense to me, if anything I'm happy that  81% people think it's worth holding onto at least some after getting burned. But time does heal wounds.

Not convenient at all. ..A close of a 5-min candle at a low of 49365 does not invalidate a pattern that is almost 3 years in the making. It would have taken a close that low on at least the daily candle but most likely weekly to invalidate it.

Here's already 100: https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html..- mining farms.- Saylor.- Musk.- Bezos.- Gates.- sultan of Brunei.- rich Saudis.- Russian oligarchs.- Satoshi (if he/they still have the wallet keys).- whoever stole most of Gox coins.....That's already way over 3. Also, since most of BTC is outside of exchanges in cold wallets (80% I think was the estimate), you don't need extreme amounts of liquidity (in coins or cash) to cause significant price movements.
-3
It is not just a trading sub. It is.....* Technical analysis, trading ideas & **strategies**..DCA and hold is definitely a **strategy** that has worked well...I myself do a hybrid. I plan on taking profit in 2025 starting at the $150k mark and every $50k up after that until half my stack is gone or BTC reaches the final ATH of the cycle. Then wait till 2026 and start buying again at the 50% retracement for the ATH at the time and buy chunks in 10% downward increments.
3
Not everyone here is bullish long-term. Most are but there are exceptions...Of those who are bullish long-term, most aren’t bullish enough. If you can’t grasp how BTC could easily reach $1 million within the next 4 years before the next halving in 2028, you aren’t bullish enough...We live in a world with hundreds of trillions of dollars allocated into a wide array of inferior stores of value relative to BTC. Market cap of all asset classes combined globally is estimated to be ~$900 trillion. BTC currently makes up $1 trillion of that. BTC reaching a price of $1 million would barely set it at a market cap of $20 trillion. At the same time, national debt is increasing by $1 trillion every ~100 days in the midst of the highest Fed funds rate in over 2 decades. The money printing will accelerate as the Fed begins cutting rates...People might think I’m laughably bullish but those same people severely underestimate just how much global wealth is out there, how little of a percentage of that global wealth needs to go into BTC to dramatically increase the price, and the likelihood of people seeking BTC as a superior mechanism to preserve their purchasing power as fiat continues to be printed into infinity.
3
>Yeah I mean I wouldn't call 55% most...tbf 55% is, by definition, "most".
4
55% of people holding all, 26% holding half probably on average, so about 70% of the returned bitcoin is being held onto. In addition to the fact that a good amount of the bitcoin still hasn't been returned. So certainly most has not been sold. You're engaging in some wishful thinking imo - this dip was not caused by mt gox selloffs, the dip was caused by fatigue of waiting for a post-halving bull run that has not materialized and lack of new catalysts relative to jan/feb/mar
1
You're just being a douche. We have been in a clear downtrend for almost 6 months. Nothing but lower highs and lower lows. That is what a downtrend means. It doesn't matter if you are trading it and staying positive, like you suggest.

Thank you. The market is a congregation of some of the darkest forces within the Cosmos and has its own ways of humbling arrogant traders and investors. I have learned the hard way to respect the sanctity of money and not be cocky when participating in the market.

And I always felt a 30% drop with consequent sentiment capitulation was required to climb higher. Now that this has begun to happen I feel better although it also sucks. It's like when you get drunk so bad you get so sick you wish you aere never born then you puke everything out. You're relieved it happened but it is not a pleasant feeling.

Day 174 since last all-time high. My bag is looking pretty thin. Market sentiment is low. The bull run should be coming any day now. Others around me have begun to question if there will even be a bull run. But I remain hopeful.

Today: BTC pumps up to $58k!..https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/3EiOk70XqJ
14
JOLTS job openings for July was revised down to 7.67 million from 7.91 million. Layoffs increased to 1.76 million in July from 1.56 million in June...[Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are now pricing in 47% odds of a 50 BP rate cut later this month rather than a 25 BP rate cut, up from 38% odds yesterday...Employment Situation report for August will release this Friday. Expectations are currently set at an unemployment rate of 4.2% even though it came in at 4.3% in July. Also, unemployment rate came in above expectations for the past 4 months...If unemployment comes in above expectations, which seems likely given how low expectations are currently set in combination with trajectory of reports for the past few months, odds of a 50 BP rate cut in September will increase. Rate cuts mean accelerated money printing and larger rate cuts mean more acceleration. Meanwhile only 450 BTC are mined per day regardless. We’ll see how it goes.
16
New day, new waterfall. Still holding on to my 80k call by november but seems like low probability at the moment as this is the worst bull market cycle I have witnessed.
10
Same we can't look back at september 2020 & september 2016 if only we knew what happened after them. ..Alas.
7
Good r/r spot for a short if you think the bottom is going to fall out, nice retracement area, might not work but a good spot, stop 58k..Edit: Probably gotta fight with it, looks like, a drop below $57,386 would be a better confirmation.
8
Anyone else not think the chart looks that bad?
9
Price is reflecting the macro condition - recession. There were news yesterday, not directly related to BTC. Volkswagen is planing to leave German because no one is buying cars right now (this is a very complicated story). China data is worse than expected. Oil dropped below $75, etc. Just look at stocks, they are correcting as well. It's astonishing that one organisation's decision can send the entire world to recession. ..Some are rebalancing to stay more in cash, because if something really bad happen, FED will aggressively save the day again. Many missed the rebound in 2020, so don't completely out of position. ..I just feel BTC is truly a macro asset, it is hard not to talk about global events.
15
Here we go boys. The spring is coiling.

This time we didn't make it all the way to the top of the channel (68-69) but stopped at 65k. The time before we touched 70 to then just dumped straight down. It's weaker with each time at the top of the channel.  Now we lost the middle of the channel and are probably going to test the low at 54k daily closure...What might be happening:..The volatility decreases which is something that has been very clear since 49k. Less pumps, less down. We enter more of a meandering state where price is not doing the same quick moves. It lingers around low 50 to low 60 without clear good entries for trading.  People are worn down after this sideways we had and just wait. The result is that we don't print a new lower low but at the same time there is no fuel to push us up to break any resistances either.  This is what the price has been doing before previous bullmarkets. It's been relatively calm. The difference this time is that we got a ton of volatility from the ETFs starting before the halving and that is dying off now. I'd say this is a good thing. I'm not sure we can enter a bullmarket with the price action and stoploss / liquidation hunting that is going on. I hope it doesn't have to last for months...Of course the election going in the right direction could be a trigger to push us up but all the bad stuff from SEC and others will keep happening until next year in that case when the new administration takes over so it might still take until then. I would expect a election pump or dump depending on the result.

Which simple indicators to watch for a true trend reversal with upside follow through?.For years now, mine has been PA establishing above the 50DEMA (currently at $60,809) and 50DSMA (currently at $61,715). Below those makes me expect more crab, above those makes me bullish.

ATH by end of the day
13
Nice little bear flag forming. Got my buys set around $51k. Can't be too long now.
6
ATH before halving has thrown a lot of people off, as many revised their expectations upwards.  ..This is crypto.  A single event in isolation doesn’t mean shit in terms of predicting future price movements.

This is the final shakeout before the rate cut on September 18th.

The sentiment here is fast beginning to mirror the bitterness I witnessed in Kitco's and other gold discussion forums where I was a occasionally lurking around prior to and in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008/09. Retail buyers and holders are increasingly clutching onto straws while becoming frustrated that their rare and unique asset fails to rise in price, at the anticipated speed, despite conditions looking near perfect, from the outside...It is a very far cry from earlier times that one has to hope for an interest rate cut for this asset to start and get moving. Somebody is asking in a post somewhat further down where the selling pressure should come from? Yesterday, I read a brief article on Cointelegraph about declining miner profitability and a possibly impending miner capitulation...Another catalyst I could easily see shaking the foundations of whatever trust is left in this bull market is a severe systemic crisis that sends global stock markets southward fast. While I do hope that BTC would have the capability to grind sideways or slightly upwards in the face of an "ordinary" economic slowdown, I have very little confidence in the price holding steady in the event of another crisis comparable in severity or shock to the announcement of the Covid pandemic in early 2020...At the end of the day, it is hard to shake off the conclusion that futures trading of BTC has broken the back of its previously spectacular price rises prematurely, that this was fully intended, and that as a result, it is now tamed and boring. My growing suspicion is that the big money and banks understand that and may have known the plan all along. There is very little if any news about additional nation states adopting BTC or setting up as strategic reserve. Whatever rumour there are about such considerations, they don't seem nearly enough to provide a real boost to the price...For the average Joe and retail investor, meanwhile, it has not become much less cumbersome to enter the BTC and crypto world. Why should the average consumer care about going through the KYC hassle to set up an exchange account, worry about it getting hacked, messing up his hardware wallet (update) or losing his seed when he can comfortably go and buy some Nvidia shares on his existing e-trading account?..As far as I am concerned, I believe this current bull market will decide whether BTC's history thus far will be written of as "interesting, but something of the past and a rather boring niche thing now" or if this asset is capable of reigniting fresh interest and attract vastly more capital. Any ATH (by late 2025) that would be less than a (roughly) 3,5 multiplication of the 2021 ATH would come as a disappointment in my view and would confirm the depressing picture of (too) fast diminishing returns that observers have registered with dismay during the last bull run.
4
Bitcoin has been following the general movements of the stock market, as much as many people don't like seeing that for some reason. I'm not sure what the market will do in the next couple weeks, but rate cuts mid September could be a boon? Unsure.
2
DXY at a weird spot, rises from here everything is toast. But it also makes sense to get down to 99.7 for one more low to suck more bulls in which would take BTC to 64k and equities one more high. Biti spot and chill is the current plan.
2
Up only from 53k
-3
Meme dates have failed (though September 2nd was fun while it lasted)...On a more serious note, I don't see a visit to the 200 week moving averages as out of the question honestly. Doesn't seem super likely, but something to consider if we get a wash out like 2020 from recession fears or something.

Total 75 BP in rate cuts so far for Bank of Canada...Very good chance the U.S. Fed cuts rates by at least 100 BP by end of year and if unemployment continues to rise regardless it could easily be 125 BP in rate cuts or more by year end.

Lots of uncertainty at the moment. ..By the end of the year lots of questions will be answered. ..I think we still see a decent bull run...If the bull is over then I’m holding on to the hopium that if the bull run was so weak then the bear is equally inversely weak and we stay above 38k in goblin town.

There was a bull run, a huge one. It went from oct 2023 to april 2024, and the price more than doubled. It's weird that everyone is just expecting another one.

Thanks for the data. It seems like inflation rate and unemployment are the Fed’s only data sets used to decide. I know there’s more but those 2 have been paramount. I doubted a 50 bps yet expected two 25bps not far apart. 50 might happen with unemployment bumping up.

Seems as sideways as  2020 was. We just didn’t have a Covid sell off this time

Recency bias. It's very similar to previous cycles. ATH before halvening has clouded your view.

I don't think macro discussion is out of place at all. The #1 driver of BTC price is demand. Macro conditions certainly affect demand

The weekly RSI is teetering on the brink of a collapse to levels lower than those set in July this year, and, more importantly perhaps, to levels that were printed back in August 2023, as the price rose from the depths of the 2022/2023 bear market. ..Anything lower than where we currently stand, with regard to the weekly RSI, would take us into deep-sea territory that was only visited in the wake of the weird price collapse in late 2018, the Covid crash and, as said, during nine months of last bear market.

Why should the average consumer care about going through the KYC hassle to set up an exchange account, worry about it getting hacked, messing up his hardware wallet (update) or losing his seed when he can comfortably go and buy some Nvidia shares on his existing e-trading account?..This whole statement is no longer relevant. ..The people that buy Nvidia are not worried about the KYC stuff because they are already part of it with their brokerage account. Plus, it is just as easy to by BTC now through the ETFs as it is to by Nvidia and not have to worry about keys, wallets etc.
4
Less than 250k would be disappointing. As for its use case and continued rise, it will happen with time. I don't think the bank conspired for this to happen, it's more likely institutions wanted to get in before the halving or wanted to show gains in the etfs. Don't lose hope yet. Never lose hope when it comes to bitcoin rewarding holders.

zzzzzzzz

No it hasnt. Stonks went up quite a lot recently while btc went sideways
15
Because there has been an overarching bearish sentiment. Investors are focused on risks and thus quick to react to the first sign of trouble. This means that anything that is considered bad, even when it has nothing to do with Bitcoin, the price will go down sharply.

There is always a bull run after the low of the Crash phase. What is your reasoning that there can be only 1 bull run...The last cycle there were 3 major bull runs. The 1st run in 2019 from the low was 418% over 5 months. Then corrected, then had 2 more runs to finish with an addition 500% increase from that 1st high. This also equates out to 2000% increase from the crash low for the cycle to the final ATH of the cycle...This run so far is 205% over 7 months. There is still so much time in the cycle for a lot more upside. There will most likely be diminishing returns on those runs as a percentage but it is so early in the cycle. I believe there are still more bull runs left...You need to gain some perspective from the history that is available. It may ease some of your angst.
2
It’s because the price is the same as it was 4 years ago. 10% ATH in four years is not worth it. If that’s what’s Bitcoin has become and the ‘true fair price’ of BTC really is in the realm of 69420 then you’re gonna see a lot of disappointed people

Market is definitely teetering right now, I wouldn't be surprised if we were down a couple months, the stock market has really been up almost the whole year, so far.
1
And honestly, I'd be totally fine with that. I'd also be fine between 80k-95k. We'll see what happens...Personally, I think if we get near 100k we'll hover a bit because, people wanna sell at 100k, it's a psychology thing.
3
Fed has two mandates to uphold: keep unemployment low and keep inflation at their 2% target. The funny part is inflation is still way higher than the Fed’s target 2% rate and the Fed is set to begin cutting rates regardless...I said it from the very beginning: if the Fed is put in a situation where they must choose between addressing high unemployment or high inflation but not both, they will address high unemployment...With high inflation people are upset but they’re too busy toiling away at their jobs trying to scrape by to do anything about it. But with high unemployment people are upset and have plenty of free time to resort to violence.

Seems also just as sideways as March 20th till September 20th 2023

If you were blindfolded you wouldn't be able to read the comments and would have no idea what the sentiment was

Well that it's 25 bps doesn't mean much by itself, it's that the Fed is finally pivoting. I tend to think a pump is more likely. Had it been pumping ahead of the rate cut... then yes, I'd agree. In addition, this isn't that big of a drop by Bitcoin standards so far, only people getting wrecked are degen longs really.
7
When someone really pisses me off I’ll put a million sats or so in a wallet and send them the public address...Then I’ll explain I ain’t spending it, and we can revisit in a couple years.  ..If you want to be a real dick; time lock the destination wallet 100 years in the future and send them the keys.

I, too, am prepared to wait and watch for another year and a bit, but the way I currently perceive the PA and the mood here, I feel this thing, whatever it might be, has been thoroughly corrupted by TPTB and no amount of hoping and wishing will be able to change that...What bothers me is not so much that the price is not rising fast enough now but the answer to the question whether you can trust it as a rock solid hedge in times of rising uncertainty and systemic instability...If one believes that BTC has been corrupted by higher powers or institutions, then how can you be sure they won't find ways to control it even more tightly or get it out of the way altogether when the day of reckoning for the current financial system will have arrived?

2
While I am not arguing with the "degenerate" part, cause I know I am at least a degen.....Let me get this straight. According to you, someone hypothetically steals your <insert blank> that you got at a really good price on because you saw the potential of it. Then you try to get <insert court system> to serve some justice. It takes ten years, but finally some parts of what got stolen from you are given back. It just so happens that those parts have become much more valuable because you were right about that thing you bought all those years ago having great potential...So that makes the victim that got the property stolen from them an un-deserving degenerate? Huh. 🤔

So you will sell at 101k?.Or you will sell 80k-95k?.Or both?.Or you will see what happens and be satisfied to just see a certain number on the screen before enduring the bear market?

Saturday: BTC dumps down to $58k! ..Sunday: BTC pumps up to $58k! ..Today: BTC dumps down to $58k!
18
SPX dips its toes in water and bitcoin be like "Weeeeee! Geronimooo!".....Gonna be a fun September :D
15
Kinda sad I can look at stocks, see red, and know bitcoin is gonna be down. But look at stocks, see green, and bitcoin could be doing whatever.
30
I'm tired boss
27
We are already at the “wake me up when September ends” part of the month and it’s only the 3rd
19
Everyone is so sure we're heading for the 40s but I don't hear nobody shorting
15
Just gotta shake my head and laugh at this point...We're taking out the 49k low before the end of the month, aren't we?
12
Is BTC just another tech stock now?
13
oh my fucking days this range
18
Volume profile tells you all you need to know...I’m still in.
17
Volume occurs only on red candles. This market looks pretty exhausted.
15
[effacé]
12
Well, my mstr limit orders hit. Wasn't expecting that so soon.
5
It may go lower but my falling knife catch at $56,167 filled. Still have one sitting at $55,550 if it dips deeper, and it looks like it will. After that, I’ll be waiting for the dust of this downside move to settle.
9
Ugh...Well, on the upside, let’s get this over with and lose those who have not seen. Six or eight months at 48k otta be the ticket. Do you have strong enough hands to hold to 2026?..There’s no volume here. No retest, bleed down, no demand. On the upside, any demand will likely drive price...ETFs are a good proxy for normie sentiment - inflows tomorrow or later this week are worth watching...Sept 15th I should have a decent bonus i’ll putting into sats. Will I get a discount? History says my liquidity events don’t realize with compatible PA.
11
Did my share and spot bought at 57600.
16
6 months of consolidation and we still care about stonks going red? Blehh genuinely disgusting...That 50W better hold or its truly going to start looking like a bear market dumpsterfire
11
So many people are expecting October to save us. What happens if it doesn't?
17
And here we go again.....edit: any bets on the bottom this time?
12
Another day another wash out
11
Seeing rumors on X that Japan problems was the cause of the dip an hour or so ago. Anyone have more concrete info?..Editing to add a link, still no more concrete reason other than Japan’s stock market dropping:..https://x.com/kobeissiletter/status/1831139302631182684?s=46
6
as always...
6
Looks like we will be doing some cliff diving possibly today. Very weak price action. Pump looks like an rsi reset.
17
Out of curiosity, I was wondering what people thought about the halving and its actual impact on price. ..The new highs occurred before-  does this mean if the halving did not occur, prices would be way worse than they currently are? Or are you just of the belief that market movers aren't impacted by it? Something else entirely?
6
It is like pinpon. Sideways will be very small. I am writing down, mid of october and november bitcoin will move 30 percent over from this price. Just wait. We are NOT done yet
8
A clear downtrend over the last 6 months has been established. Pretty disappointing.
11
Pretty nice day to swap some BTC ETF for MSTR. They're way down against the ETF on the daily and usually shoot up way faster on any gains
6
Chart looks dumpy AF
11
I find it funny everyone was trying to fade the bearish September historical seasonality, saying it's a meme. sometime's it's as simple as following historical trends . keep it simple
5
Funny, I remember hearing not too long ago that Sep/Oct would bring the pump. Now all I'm hearing is how September is historically weak, so it's a write-off. Expectations for October are already being quickly dialed down. Expect to see the goalposts shifted again to Q1 2025 soon.
6
Dumping this hard an no one even commenting. Bottom getting close…

Inverse H$S on daily?

See ya'll in the 40's. Missing 58k gang already.

Soon 50s will seem like a dream when we’re in the 40s. Not selling, but sure as shit am not buying until <40 or >70. I feel like this is the consensus among those with cost basis in the low teens/single digits. Which is why I think 30s happens first

The two are not mutually exclusive. Also dramatizing it by saying “everyone” & “so sure” is just cope. Most bearish discourse is still being downvoted here

I’m just waiting for the new year to sell for tax purposes at this point.

October 2025 maybe
3
If you look at it from the institutional perspective Oct is simply when buys will start by funds that don't mind riskier assets and then the rest of the dominoes fall in time. Maybe the 4 year cycle theory is a bust maybe not, but the theory of inflation definitely is not a bust

Get leverage arrangements in order.. I don’t think we’re going podracing just yet.
6
Well,  im betting on 54k for sure. But i dont know if we are actually gonna set a lower low (43k?) in the coming month(s), or if we go double bottom around 50k… ..Im still bullish, even if we retrace all the way to 43k. Problem is that i really am not feeling the cosnuner interest at the moment… which is both good and bad. Good thing: etf’s and halving slowly but surely locking up / decreasing supply. Bad thing: this might take a while to manifest. ..Still betting 15x lowest-low for this “cycle” which eould be about 225k min. And remember: when you are trading this but not day trading: it does not matter a bit if your satoshi count decreases on the way up: you want to make sure to sell near the top, and buy the bottom, better sell and rebuy once too many instead of riding the bear all the way down in disbelief; you will make back the sats 2x / 3x or even more...Have a great day my friends!
3
> Editing to add a link..What does the link say?
3
I hope you're right. I began selling my stack...Next month is when I will stop being short-term bearish and go bull mode. Until then, I am constantly looking to sell high and buy back lower.
12
>does this mean if the halving did not occur, prices would be way worse than they currently are?..It is 138 days after the halving. ..During those 138 days, ₿62,100 (approx, based on 10 min block times exactly) less Bitcoin have been created than if the halving had not occurred. ..Right now, that amount is worth $3,608,134,200.00..So, yes, I think the current price would be lower if the halving had not occurred.
21
Halvening only has an impact on supply after all those who were desperately banking on halvening, instead are forced to sell...Many people bank on sure things with Bitcoin:..* *"Never goes below previous ATH"*:  Rekt how ponzi scams including FTX?.* *"Doubles immediately after halvening"*: In the process of churning down how many loans which can't afford their payments?.* *"Has never cross on the spiral chart!"*: How many will be caught when it does?..Once all those people are rekt and have sold, then supply from mining issuance mining matters more than supply from desperate people.
2
People think supply is limited by halvings but BTC inflates at 1.5% and every coin already minted is also "supply" ie of OG holders, seized coins, mtgox coins, etc.
-8
The recent halving hype is just euphoria made up by the Twitter boyz. 19million of mined “supply” is waiting for new suckers
-7
Do you mean you think the price will be 30% higher than now here in November?  ..$57,600 \* 1.3 = $74,880?
6
Pinpon sux
3
A clear downtrend that has formed a bull flag which is the handle to a monster size cup. It's going to get exciting soon.
24
Don't have to go up by much to invalidate it. Still a tight crab range
13
Yes, that is how leverage works 😁
8
Risky play.  You’re basically calling the bottom.  If it’s not then it’s a bad trade 
1
this shouldn't surprise me... but I genuinely don't understand who is dumping bitcoin at this point lol. Like where is the selling coming from. It's just bananas
12
Those tend to be the times when market makers start to pump!
1
i'd attest this more to correlation with tradfi (futures following through with the blood today) than seasonality, and it's also only the 3rd
5
Fact is that nobody has a clue except maybe a few mega whales. It’s all guesswork influenced by the emotional state of the market.

This might not be a bear market just yet, could be something like 2019 play out, which would be a mid-cycle top...The good news is that this would mean 2025 would still have potential to be a good year if so. (in absence of black swan event)..We'll find out soon

There's quite a lot of leverage available around and below 57200. If we reach that far, it's open season again.

That's what we all intend. Too often however it goes "buy high(er) sell low(er)". Fear is the mind-killer...

People here think that *new* supply is limited by halvings tbf
12
Sounds like it! Bitty Bot her!
6
It is a guess but might be more. After halving in 2016 and 2020 bitcoin made almost 30 percent over on Q4. I am expecting same but might be higher due to ETF

Yeah, the super monster size cup & handle that formed in gold price from 2012-2024 is actually playing out pretty nicely.

Bitcoin is just having a conversation with itself. A bit grumpy tonight.
1
100%. My theory for awhile has been that the '4 year cycle' narrative has gone too mainstream, to the point where we had all these people proclaiming that it would be their "last cycle" and the one they're going to retire on. ..Aunts, uncles, entire families expecting breathtaking new highs right on schedule. Market needs to crush those hopes and get retail to capitulate, and then maybe we go up in 2026 or some point when most have given up and think we're going into another multi-year bear market.

Not that often. I value my mental health

A few times. Not at all if I know it's bad lol

If the top was March and it barely surpassed the previous ATH, then why would 2028 be another bull run. ..Firstly the 4 year cycle will have died in 2024. ..Secondly why would anyone get pulled back in in 2028 when the previous bull run was so pathetic.

Crab Rave.

That is why 1) you should have trading strategies with proven positive expectancy and take trades in as many setups as the market presents you that are tailored to said strategies to allow the law of large numbers to play out your edge so you can accumulate more profits than losses over time and 2) practice following your trading strategies and not deviate from them. Otherwise you'd be taking random trades whose expectancy is negative (due to spread and commissions)...Or if you rely more on short-term fundamentals you could in theory still consistently make money but I personally don't rely too much on FA for short term trades.

10
if you think the people who got their coins decided to just wait a month before selling.... sure... Anyone who made millions would have dumped that as soon as they got it if they really wanted to.
2
Agree except the supply halving definitely has an impact on the price. It has to. There’s certainly an element of expectation from the markets though too. Also, with a Trillion $ market cap, substantial moves up are far more difficult. If you look back at the previous cycles the X multiplication was far higher, but the dollar value was much less. Last cycle felt like a non starter compared to previous ones, but we went up over $60k, so it was significantly more successful that previous years. Food for thought.

I had to install an app that makes me wait 5 seconds before opening trading view and then agree to go in. It can be addictive

Got it, thanks for confirming and sharing your reasoning! The default of 30 days seems reasonable for the prediction then, unless you want to delete it and make a new one set to Sept 30

I keep seeing these bitty bot automatic messages, what does it do though?
2
I bet the rate cut gives it a tickle. Maybe we’ll get another 70k dump out of it
3
you still of the mind we crab walk up to 65ks before another rejection? ..sadly, the only divergence we have seen is on tradFi up days. seems to trade in lockstep on down days.

You're totally right... but far too few seem to follow anything resembling a strategy. And overleveraging just compounds the damage.

no my brother, think for yourself. 2021 was the year AFTER the halving year (2020). we are currently inside the halving year. 2025 would be the year after this time. This is why I said you don;t know cycles... but maybe you just forgot. Sorry if I came across aggressive.

“$16b in stablecoins will be repaid to FTX users between November and December.”..Hmm wonder where this money will go? I’m sure these degens will park it into their 401k and treasury bonds...Or you know … we’re about to break ath after October.
20
September is packed with US macro events:.- 10 Sep: Presidential Debate.- 11 Sep: CPI release.- 12 Sep: PPI release.- 18 Sep: FOMC meeting..I expect positive news and still believe this could push us at least towards a test of 69/70 and we'll have to see if there's enough momentum to push us through into Uptober (meme)...Imagine one of those YEs when BTC is having a blast and you're shopping for xmas presents with *that grin* on your face... that'd be nice. One can dream.

Not really any news, just some thoughts:..PA seems to reflect the fact we are close to a recession. If you look at USD M0 (around 5.9 trillion), it peaked in Feb and we all know what happend in March. I read somewhere there are over $900 billion savings globally (I could be wrong), because people are scared and interest rate offer good enough return. BTC feels like a wild animal that have been domesticated, that been said, I am still over 90% in. Let's see what happens in October/November.
13
uptember
16
Hard to predict short term PA at the moment. I do know that I bought a little over 850,000 sats out of my last paycheck and am not worried about it. #normalize sats   :-)
9
I wish the industry would come together and re-denominate Bitcoin. Look at GLD. Or SPY. Much more approachable than seeing $58,000 for 1 of something. People are dumb in not understanding fractions, but that’s never going to change. Unit bias is holding bitcoin back

This is the last "pump" above 60k before we began our descent to the low 40s.

Sept 18 the starting gun is fired.
6
Of course it is coming. In just 15 days we'll enter the range of 146 days in which we will go through the start of the post-halvening bull run. Reminder that Bitcoin hit 69k before purely on its own strength that was only stopped due to some major events that shook the markets. Hitting 73k this year was only because of ETF and the optimism surrounding it, and we are still well above the projected price (~17%) Bitcoin would have been without ETF.
14
It hit a 17 month high of 16,128 both the 17 month low was 15,698. Before that 17 month period, the last time the number was so low was in 2015. How is this not grasping for straws?..(source: https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/addresses-greater-than-100-btc/)

You never know. Back in last year september was awful and October 40 percent up. Also stock market is ath but not bitcoin? It is definitly manipulated.
4
time for us to buck the usual trend, sick of everyone and their mom pointing out September is always bearish, we've been flat since February and I see no reason why we can't test 70k again in a week or two, stonk market is still going ballistic
4
This is the way.
3
This would only help normie plebs who are buying $100 worth on robinhood anyway, and if those are who we’re dependent on then we have real problems...It takes about three seconds of thinking to get past the unit thing.  And since crypto is a pretty nerdy thing to begin with I can’t really see the point...Being able to buy 1/1000th of a bitcoin is one of the cool things about it in the first place.
13
I've been banging this drum since 2013, at least sats has emerged as a clear winner of smaller units, which is progress. Now it just needs to be used more...The worst part of it was the irony that the people declaring "they're stupid if they can't just understand and get used to small decimal numbers" are the same people who opposed sats because it was different from what they were used to.
9
How much is 1kg of gold?
8
No thanks.

Buy sats. You can get 2000 of them for a buck. 
14
Don't worry, the lead ETF might well achieve that..Let's not conflate a market price with a technology, a network, an ecosystem, a community etc.
7
Then they'd say btc increased supply
3
"the industry" is already using sats. Shitcoin casinos, on the other hand, make their money by confusing users.
2
Back in 2014 or so, bits was becoming famous. 1 bit = 1 uBTC = 100 satoshis = 10^-6 BTC. I wish it would have caught on.

You missed the point. They are starting to hold again and not continuing to sell.

No, he wants some marketing operation to happen so people can claim to own Bitcoins instead of Sats. Doesn't change a damn thing. It would instead make people more skeptical and biased because "how come before I could not afford even one Bitcoin and now I can afford many? The price has crashed or it has been lowered so it's no longer worth getting it". That would be the average outcome of renaming "Bitcoin" smaller units of Bitcoin..When I sometimes talk about Bitcoin and I mention you can still buy fractions of it and it has been like that for a decade or so the average reaction is "uuuh yeah whatever"
14
How about I sell you 10,000 Satoshis for $5.92? Pretty cheap, eh?
3
It’s sats. Just use sats. Everything else is stupid.

Are NVDA, Amazon, Apple also only for the “big boys” now? This makes no sense. Without several stock splits I’m confident these stocks wouldn’t move the way they do

Lmao I hold everything sir

I'm all for this. Smashed that like button.
2
No, you definitely missed the point. Look at the plot I shared, the fluctuations that lead to this "17 month high" are insignificant. You can't just comb through every possible subset of data until you find one piece that you like and then disregard everything else...If you look at wallets above 1000 BTC and 10,000 BTC they've been on a decrease in recent months. So even what you were saying at face value wouldn't hold...But none of that is really significant, people split and consolidate wallets all the time and overall they're pretty meaningless stats that are graphed simply because its easy to with a publicly available blockchain.
3
Theres literally no crypto influencer on YouTube right now that doesn't make 15 minute videos scribbling random lines on the Bitcoin chart. Halfway through the video is always where the altcoin shitbag shilling starts...If you have a recommendation for crypto YouTubers who are not just talking out of their asses, I would love to know who they are. 👍🏼..Also FWIW, I've been recently enjoying the podcast "This week in Bitcoin" 😁
1
Why would there be another bull run in 2028...I’m extremely confident that if 73k was the peak and we rot back to 15k that’s the end of bitcoin. ..Why would anyone invest in an asset that doesn’t perform anymore.
4
Too much coins accumulated by the "big guys" to let it slide too much.
2
I went to the mirror to look myself in the eye & ask myself if I'm a bot.  My reflection said "I'm not a bot, but I don't know about you."..I should have bought a better mirror.  I spent that money on sats instead.

Every nation has more trouble telling 0.0001 and 0.00001 apart than .100,000 and 10,000

Although it’s admittedly hard to forget that a pint’s a pound the whole world round..Btw—I’m all about universal adoption of the metric system and love the following joke:..If God had wanted us to use the metric system, he’d have given us 10 fingers on which to count.
3
It is...https://goldprice.org/gold-price-per-kilo.html
11
It's not just marketing it's UX, and it's more about making sats the more commonly used denomination because it's more intuitive for people because it aligns much better with what they're used to when large numeric ranges are used, especially with money.
6
seems logical but stock splits indicate humans are far from it.
5
sound practically worthless;)
3
I was a big proponent of mBTC, but that's asking too much of the general public...Bits and sats I think are pretty good for the average person. 100 sats = 1 bit. 1m bits = 1 BTC
2
Preach. This is precisely what I want the exchanges to do
2
Bitcoin only responds to buys in the millions. Plebs buying $200 worth have zero impact.

>Some more proof..Here is some more. ..Coins are being accumulated and moved off of exchanges now. It started happening in July.  My post was just another sign that the tides are changing.

In late 2022 when price was below $20k, I remember you repeatedly saying “IF btc ever gets back to $60k I’m selling everything” for a litany of reasons. ..Yesterday you said you’d sell 2/3 if something something. ..Now you know, with extreme confidence, a condition that will end bitcoin...Just sell it all when it hits $60k like you said you would.
8
Thank you, you couldn't say anything better for the health of this cycle....And the 4 year cycle is by now common knowledge, so the burden of the proof lies on the contrarian theory..Said otherwise, as long as there's a positive year on year performance, so above 42k$ at EoY 2024 (and most indicators and long term TA are OK with this), the cycle is not cancelled.
6
This is what may need to happen...But ain’t nobody printing any more Bitcoin...People will continue to accumulate and as long as this goes up, price rise, and even dramatic price rise, is inevitable...It may not happen on your schedule. It helps to have seen.
4
This is exactly what wall street want you to believe...They will break the 4 year cycle by having the peak occur before the 2024 halving, a poxy 7% higher than $69k...They will sell the shit out of it in 2025 (under the guise of a recession), whilst the 4 year bros be thinking 2025 = up and up for BTC cos its special innit...Hodlers will then say, "*its over*" just like you have in your comment. So as people sell because they think its over, the reality is anything but, rather its just getting started...BTC will trade down in 2025 maybe sideways in 2026 and whilst it trades down and to the sides, wall street gonna buy the fuk out of it...And then once the cat is out of the bag, retail and others will FOMO in 2027 and 2028 taking us to $200k and beyond...
2
that was just their theory. i think its an interesting one thats all...I disagree that it would be the end for bitcoin. there will always be whales who will buy coin for 15k. The asset has performed. its gone from 16k to 73k this run. People have made a lot of money.
1
Lol
-1
I'll take your word for it, but I don't think that's true...in isolation where the number is abstract...maybe...but if it is something that is observed in a none abstract way...I.e. on a price tag, I don't think so...For example. If you ask anyone what $1m would buy in their country, they'd have a pretty good idea...ask them about 1 million Nigerian ringgets...probably not...because regardless of the denomination Ringgets are abstract unless you know their value...The denomination has some bearing, but not as much bearing as you might think...The other problem we face is that for some reason maths is generally considered to be difficult when we're at school because maths requires a different kind of mental processing...Mind you, I'm not a mathematician, but I possess a lot of further mathematical qualifications in areas like pure maths and mechanics and personally I haven't been in touch with how a typical "non maths nerd" person sees numbers for a long time...one of the first things you have to reconcile in your head when you do further maths is that a lot of incomprehensible concepts like "infinity" and "higher dimensions" crop up a lot and you just have to accept that your comprehension of them will either be limited or just straight be impossible otherwise you'll go mad...For me, globally re-denominating Bitcoin doesn't make a lot of sense...its already possible to change the denomination in most Bitcoin oriented tools should a user desire to...SATs etc is already an accepted term and has been for a long time...Just like pints, milliliters, litres, ounces and gallons have no bearing on the way a typical person buys milk...the unit we use for Bitcoin would probably have no bearing on the way people interact with Bitcoin...Dual scales and alternate units are something humans have lived with for a very long time and you can see it everywhere. There's a good chance the speedo in your car is in both miles and kilometres. We buy meat by the kilo and yet still buy quarter pounder burgers...my local market sells apples by the dozen not by weight.....By assuming that folks aren't buying Bitcoin because decimals are too hard you're not giving people much credit...people aren't as generally stupid as you think and are quite capable of adapting...Remember. There used to be a time where you could buy something for "two bits" which was a quarter of a Spanish Dollar, this denomination was known as "pieces of eight"...if people could handle that sort of bullshit centuries ago, they can certainly handle decimals now.
1
Stop it. $/oz is king
-5
Guess that will happen eventually? Just not now when one Satoshi is a fraction of a cent of USD. Regardless this isn't what I got from OP post maybe I misunderstood
3
Stocks are an integer unit. Bitcoins integer unit is Satoshi, and you can get quite a few for a fiat dollar. ..If you don’t grasp this, I’m not sure you’re going to be an asset to Bitcoin. Those folks are best left to wait until it’s explained to them, and when many fewer sats will exchange for fiat dollars.
6
Bitcoin suffers from a bias that is unheard of in stocks. Which is the reason this marketing operation would result in what I wrote before
3
Bits are stuoid. Just say 100 sats...Worry when 1 sat becomes unaffordable. 
3
All this is proving is that you fall for the clickbait really easily. You will find these same sorts of articles going back 5+ years. ..[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-classic-bull-pennant-breakout-as-btc-whales-go-on-buying-spree](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-classic-bull-pennant-breakout-as-btc-whales-go-on-buying-spree)..  .They used this same logic to predict a huge breakout in mid november 2021, about a week before the crash and 3 year bear market. Don't be so gullible.
5
I don’t think 73k is the cycle peak. I’m hopeful it continues up over the next 6-12 months. ..I was stating that Bitcoin is in serious trouble if we have had the peak. ..Regarding saying I would sell everything at 60, I’m up and down like a yo-yo and over allocated. Change my view weekly.

I'm okay with this. Just gonna buy as always.

People are more used to big numbers than decimals, which is why 1,000,000 will be commonly recognized by most people, it even has a name "a million" and 0.000001 is a number most people never have to deal with in their lives...Additionally, unit bias exists, it's not something I invented, and behavioral biases are not necessarily about intelligence - unit bias is very much about intuitiveness since most things people encounter that would suffer from unit bias address that bias - stock splits etc...Since unit bias exists, why not remove it from the equation if there's no downside to doing so?..I'm not denying that most people are smart enough to get past it eventually, I'm saying why not remove that hurdle...https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-unit-bias-psychology-vaneck

Maybe in the US. Wtf is an "oz" anyway?
13
Yet the entire purpose of the code on which Bitcoin functions is to transcend that precise bias, fundamental weakness, and looming liability.
2
This whole “I’m smarter than you are” mindset in the community is nauseating. Whatever you say, dude..

>3 year bear market..?..Do you need your meds?
2
Then congrats to you, as your mindset, belief in BTC and patience will allow you to win in either scenario.....* 2025 is a bull year and you bag $200k a coin.* The next couple of years are bear years and you get to buy BTC on sale..YOU win either way. On the other side tho, the hodlers who will sell in 2025 because they think BTC is done for will be finessed by wall street in 2025...IF its a bear year.

No one can answer that for you, as no one knows for sure what 2025 will bring, all we do, every single one of us, is guess...4 year cycle bros say 2025 equals bull run, they have total conviction in that belief...I on the other hand think that is unlikely but hey I could be wrong...I think the narrative from the fed at the next meeting will be telling, lets see how asset prices react a week after papa powells remarks have had a chance to settle and be absorbed by the wider market.

You kicked off the thread by saying that people are so dumb they can't handle subunits - now you're sick to see the sentiment repeated?

To be fair he does sound a lot smarter than you.
5
Man, this attitude is what nauseates me. As if being smart and making an observation is somehow a personal attack. It's not...Are you suggesting that if someone doesn't have something positive to say they shouldn't say it? Because unfortunately, that's not how intelligent conversation goes down. You can't have a rounded discussion without risking offense somewhere along the line...and crucially if you wish to know the facts around something you have to be open minded enough to accept them when they arise, whether it fits your current belief system or not...because facts are facts.
2
What do you mean
2
Learn to accept standards...The two denominations that get used are BTC and sats...In the future, nobody is going to talk about buying Bitcoin.  They'll talk about buying sats...When Bitcoin hits a million bucks, the denomination you're desperately arguing for would be too expensive, and you'll be fighting for some other new and lesser denomination...Just. Use. Sats...Satoshis are already the standard, and guess what?  They're affordable.

Then bitcoin is lucky to have him as an “asset”!

I’m saying that pretending you’re smarter than the rest of the world by “understanding” bitcoin before everyone else, who will allegedly “get what they deserve” by not being as smart to buy as early as you - is foolish. Couldn’t care less if that guy is/is not attacking me personally

Cultural_Entrance312 is very much splitting hairs and distracting from your point with a strawman deflection, but the bear market definitely ended in Oct 2023 at the latest, and more fairly in Dec 2022, i.e. after very much less than 3 years

I didn't get that impression from the post at all. Absolutely nothing that was said suggested any of that.

Everyone gets Bitcoin at the price they deserve. Cheers

Not splitting hairs at all. He showed a chart that was from the inception of bitcoin. Basically, he said this 14 year chart is the same as the 1.5 year chart I originally reverenced. Oranges to my apples, from my "tide is changing comment" which indicates a short timeframe. ..I actually would expect that the number of holders of >100 coins to actually drop over the remainder of the halvings going forward. It will ebb and flow but should have a gradual downward slope due to the redistribution of coins caused by mass adoption...I thought the "?" was straight forward to his "3 year bear market". The meds part was due to him implying that I am gullible, when he spouts of nonsense about BTC in a 3 year bear. You knew what I was saying about his bear market statement.
2
Or sells. I’m just sick of people acting like they’re from the future. Adios
1
The 14 year chart very clearly shows that a slight uptick in # of wallets above 100 BTC does not mean a price surge is imminent. ..After the high in mid november 2021, it took nearly 3 years to recover. That's what I mean by 3 years bear market. Perhaps there's a better term than bear market, but the point remains that the uptick in 100 BTC holders did not lead to a price surge, and the cointelegraph article claiming that it was going to was dead wrong, as the one you linked likely is.
2
>After the high in mid November 2021, it took nearly 3 years to recover. That's what I mean by 3 years bear market. ..That is not what a bear market is. There is a clear definition for it in economics. Not what it means to you. ..>that the uptick in 100 BTC holders did not lead to a price surge..You keep implying by your comments that this is the only reason that I think the market is going up. I started my post with "Some more proof " with "more" meaning their is at least an additional reason I think it is going up.  Then gave you 2 additional items I think back my idea.  ..Also, the timeframe you are talking about is in a whole different part of the 4 year cycle. It was part of the end of the Bubble phase as start of the Crash phase and not the end of the Accumulation phase start of the Bubble phase that we are currently in. Again, you try to make a point with apples to oranges...As I stated in my last comment, "I actually would expect that the number of holders of >100 coins to actually drop over the remainder of the halvings going forward." but that is on a macro level over decades. On a micro level, i.e. month to month, it most definitely can mean a change in the direction of the market when there are **more** signs...Here are more reasons I think the rally is coming:..[https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1f65ngc/comment/lkzr8l6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1f65ngc/comment/lkzr8l6/)

It is you who are implying that SundayAMFN is arguing against your broader idea, where in fact the argument is *only* about  # of wallets above 100 BTC as a causal metric, which it almost cerrtainly isn't. You need to address this point directly or this thread will never be resolved. Talking about the definition or bear markets or bringing in other metrics as part of a broader idea does not address anything regarding the validity of the # of wallets above 100 BTC metric.

I did address this dirrectly. I guess you didn't read far enough down in my response. Hear it is again.  .  .As I stated in my last comment, "I actually would expect that the number of holders of >100 coins to actually drop over the remainder of the halvings going forward." but that is on a macro level over decades.

the week of September 16th (Sept 16th - Sept 22nd) encompasses the 154 day mark since the halving. in previous cycles, 154 days after the halving on the weekly chart, bitcoin has been on the very start of a multi-month bull with many dips along the way. when the 154 day mark has hit, we've always been over the halving price, up to +25% (which would be 65-80k for this cycle). **IF** we see history play out again, then by September 22nd we should expect price to be over 65k...if price is below 65k on September 23rd, then this phenomenon would sadly be at an end...https://i.redd.it/abseklcj48md1.png
29
i know it's easy to get all "where muh bull marketz" when price goes down a bit but nothing about drops *in and of themselves* signifies...well, anything really. this is a volatile asset. historically, during bitcoin bull runs, it has dropped 20% tons of times...in the run-up to the December 2017 peak, we dropped 20%+ 7 times. in the run-up to the November 2021 peak, we dropped 20%+ 8 times...this chart is all of the times since 2016 that bitcoin has dropped by 20% or more:..https://i.redd.it/2ij9insf88md1.png

So I guess the difference between a Bitcoin bull market and a Bitcoin bear market is that we go down slowly in a bull market and fast in a bear market.

With several bearish posters spouting their doom and gloom. Just wanted to let you know, **The bull market (and 4 year cycle) is not over**. This is just a lull (consolidation) before the face melting rise in the price of BTC...BTC has taken so many shots on the chin the last couple of months and is standing strong. It made it through the Germany dump, the Mt. Gox distribution and some major profit taking from long term holders )from the front ran ETF launch). Even though August felt brutal with a price swing of 25% from peak to trough. It ended the month with only a **~~2%~~** **8%** decline from open to close...Bitcoin is turning the corner. I also think the usual Uptober is going to happen a month early, meaning this month...Last month's price action is similar September 2020 (for all those “it’s different this time)...[https://www.tradingview.com/x/RbOMh0Wc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RbOMh0Wc/)..The cup and handle is one of the most accurate TA patterns out there...[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ypWVxcvG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ypWVxcvG/)..All data is pointing to whales changing from taking profits in July to buying the dips and removing the coins from exchanges in August...[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-low-price-retest-60k-bullish-analysts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-low-price-retest-60k-bullish-analysts)..[https://u.today/40000-btc-in-48-hours-heres-whats-happening](https://u.today/40000-btc-in-48-hours-heres-whats-happening)..[https://www.coinglass.com/Balance](https://www.coinglass.com/Balance)..The Fed is going to cut the interest rates.

How low could this pullback go?.I used to use Elliot Wave TA as my primary TA tool. I no longer do. But if you do, and you also look for its 3 wave 5 wave patterns for corrective and impulsive moves, the daily shows a corrective 3 wave move after the dump to $49,050 with the current wave resembling a 5 wave impulsive move that is at the start of sub wave 3 of the downside move. If this plays out, wave 3 will bottom around $54K, followed by a more sideways wave 4 with some upside, and then finish by dipping to around $50K. ..TL/DR: there’s significant downside potential, although I doubt it hits $50K, and now you know why I stopped using EW as a primary tool. I did, however, spend some time learning the system, so just thought I’d share.

the week of September 2nd (Sept 2nd - Sept 8th) encompasses the 140 day mark since the halving. in previous cycles, 140 days after the halving on the weekly chart, bitcoin has hit a price it would never hit again. **IF** we see history play out again, then in the next week we should either expect to see a nice wick down or the start of a long uptrend – or both...starting on September 9th, if we see price go lower than it was between Sept 2nd - Sept 8th, then this phenomenon would sadly be at an end...https://i.redd.it/la0yk60c28md1.png

One thing that is interesting about Bitcoin's price is that the movers really do not give retail swing traders good price levels to sell.  This can be evidenced by looking at the local tops made by Bitcoin this year.  It hit 73K (ATH), and then, 72K, 71, 70K, and then 65K...1. 73K was a new ATH but it wasn't a level much higher than the previous ATH of 69K made back in 2021.  Most of the retailers who are looking to sell big this cycle or to swing trade probably have been holders since 2021.  So there is no way that psychologically they would have sold 70-75K area given that this is only 2-3% higher than 69K, which was set in 2021.  So selling off at this level meant that no retail traders managed to sell here back in March..2. 72, 71, 70K:  same story.  Whenever it went up to 70+K area in the past few months, retailers were felt with excitement that this was going to be the final blow that gets up to 100K.  If you didn't sell at 73K, you were not going to sell at 72, 71, 70K level..3. 65K:  However, after unable to break 70K for the 5th time in a row, everyone and their moms recognized that Bitcoin's price was inside a descending channel that formed from 73K.  So with the recent drop to 49K, many of the swing traders who got the pattern down probably were starting to think about selling at the top of the channel, which was now in the 69-70K range.  What happened?  The recent local high got stomped at 65K and couldn't even reach the top of the descending channel this time around.  Again, swing traders couldn't find the opportunity to sell...So basically, all of this price movement is just not giving the retail traders good opportunities to swing trade with the traders always one step behind the general movement.  And with so many hedge funds/quant trading/big money involved in crypto trading, what is not going to happen from this point forward is a scenario where retails manage to roughly time the top when it comes to selling.   And I think retail swing trader who also follow the 4 year cycle is looking at the 90-120K range as a sweet spot for selling.  This is probably not a range where they would sell everything but roughly around 100K is where they will sell bunch and "think" that the 2026/27 bear market will give them good opportunity to buy back lower...On paper this makes so much sense, and this is pretty much my strategy as well.  However, if we go by the rule that retailers will no longer come close to timing the top to trade, then this range will not be the correct one.   If 100K is near the ATH for this cycle, then the whales (and not the retailers) would have spent a lot of money moving Bitcoin's price up to 100K level with the retailers timing the top and dumping on them.  The chances of that happening is close to zero.  ....So I am thinking that this cycle either vastly underperforms with the top being around 73-80K range or overperforms with the top being 150K+ range.

This price area is a magnet for liquidations. aka the bulls and bears like to fight here.

So many days now when you could buy below $60k, I don't get what people are complaining about... ;)

Are you guys new to Bitcoin? I mean how come you can say we are heading to bear market? Last year around this time how much was bitcoin $25K and after October 15th WITHOUT any major event bitcoin moved 40 percent. I remember like yesterday folks from out of usa were saying “what you guys did?” “ what the hell happend, I just woke up and bitcoin moved up 20 percent lol” Dont you remember?

Some people think that the calendar changing from September to October is going to magically inspire a rally to 300k in the next four months. If it sounds absurd, that's because it is. Theres a better chance we end the year below where we started to close out a red yearly candle than that happening.

Average net inflows since spot ETF approval is at $109.3 million per trading day...We’ve had 161 trading days since spot ETF launch. But there’s only 5 trading days in a week. Today marks 235 calendar days since spot ETF launch. In terms of average daily inflows in calendar days, we’re at $74.91 million per day...450 BTC are mined per day. If we reach a point where buying/selling outside of spot ETF’s is net neutral and spot ETF’s are chasing newly mined BTC only, equilibrium price would be $166.46k per BTC...This is a new low for average daily net inflows since spot ETF launch...[Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are currently pricing in 30% odds of a 50 BP rate cut in September rather than a 25 BP rate cut. Employment Situation report for August will release this Friday. Expectations are currently set at an unemployment rate of 4.2% even though it came in at 4.3% in July. Also, unemployment rate came in above expectations for the past 4 months...If unemployment comes in above expectations, which seems likely given how low expectations are currently set in combination with trajectory of reports for the past few months, odds of a 50 BP rate cut in September will increase. Rate cuts mean accelerated money printing and larger rate cuts mean more acceleration. Meanwhile only 450 BTC are mined per day regardless. We’ll see how it goes.

If I understand the liquidation data correctly there would be at least a billion in short liquidations if we just touch 60k short term?.Regardless, doesn't seem like it'll happen any time soon.. selling pressure is relentless.

Moved a bunch of cash to exchange. Not long until I’ll be buying in the 40’s it seems. Weird times but I’ll just load up for 2028.

September is upon us, seasonality is not in our favor but I’m seeing a lot of folks trying to countertrade September seasonality saying it’s a meme and we’re likely to blast off instead. Sometimes it’s as simple as keeping it simple stupid and just respecting historical monthly trends . Better to have cash ready to pounce on deals and not being balls deep in everything all the time like the moonbois want you to be

If the 4 year cycle theory is correct as the majority say, then assume BTC is $100k in September 2025 and then rips to $200k in early December 2025, ok cool, congrats...But I’m curious, for the bros who believe in that above scenario, if “*hypothetically*” say $73k was the peak in March 2024 at what price / time point in 2025 will you say *“somethings wrong with the cycle”* ..* For the December 2017 peak the previous ATH was broken February 2017.* For the November 2021 peak the previous ATH was broken late November 2020..At some point in 2025 the BTC price has to break the previous ATH of $69k and most people assume it will. BUT if 2025 is a global recession year and BTC is unable to shield itself from the global asset sell off such that $73k was the peak, my question to you guys is…..*"At what point in 2025 will you change your view"*
2
The cycle topped in March

Another day. Another K.

Can the 4 yr cycle zealots articulate why the pre halving ATH did not already invalidate the 4 year cycle? I learned from a post below that the ATH was only "supposed" to occur maximum 219 days after the halving since that's been the longest it took BTC to break previous cycle ATH...Or do we take 74k to be the cycle high, and the theory is still potentially valid as long as we break 74k sometime in Q4? I'm trying to understand what it will take for people to admit the 4yr cycle is broken. I also realize there is no standard 4yr cycle definition, but most seem to believe it to mean a massive face melting rally will be catalyzed by the issuance reduction and begin 6-12 months after the halving.
-9
Here comes the fun part.  They seem to think these ETFs are going to work out any better than the CBOE stuff did in 2018 in terms fo squashing Bitcoin's price.  They seem to think they will be able to control this like they do precious metals...Fail...Buy the dip and hodl, same as ever.

Local low from May becoming "resistance" (potentially), or confirming as "support"? Say it ain't so but the former looks more likely given the downtrend we've been in for six months...Using quotes cause BTC doesn't care about res/support but it's interesting to note that what felt like an absolute bargain lower low in May and what seemed at the time to be a blow off bottom now feels like it could be a difficult level to hold in the short to medium term. Just more "bull market" behavior.

12
I’m with you United.. it’s pretty sobering but this is the weakest bull run to date so far. It’s starting to become apparent that 100k is farther away than we thought. I remember in February when we were convinced 100k was just around the corner. Many had price targets at 80-90k by June. Anyone remember this summer’s meme cup and handle/ inverse H&S? This was upvoted daily for weeks until it was evident it was a failed pattern
5
I appreciate your consistency, truly. But what’s going to be next after this narrative also fails? Meme cup and handle is toast, ETF flows are drying up…maybe 3rd times a charm and rate cuts provide something real

It depends who owns those shorts.  Seems to be defended very well so far

So buy??

Down $600 in BTC, up $90 in Roth IRA, perfectly balanced as God intended.

Now that BTC is more mainstream there is maximum fuckery   price wise and time wise to minimize gains for the average market participant... Fakeouts, overextended moves, and leghty chops are the norm now. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up being a delayed cycle with a dump to the 30s, then a  massive pump to 300-400k, before a long term distribution, bear market.

I'll start to freak out the more we venture into Q2 2025 without hitting 100k

My tripwire for "something is wrong with the cycle" is shown in the top two charts:..[https://imgur.com/a/btc-charts-1-sep-2024-ZoOAXa9](https://imgur.com/a/btc-charts-1-sep-2024-ZoOAXa9)..Top chart is BTC price and 4-year ratio.  For more than 2.5 years, the ratio has been 2.5x-7x (with the brief excursion above 7x on the 4th anniversary of the March 2020 COVID crash).  The previous range was roughly 10x-50x and lasted 4 years...The middle chart is BTC price with 1x, 2.5x, and 7x the price 4 years earlier.  If BTC goes into the red zone in the next 18 months, I would be very concerned.  If it goes into the black zone (i.e. the price is LESS than it was 4 years ago) then all the narratives go out the window.
4
>at what price / time point in 2025 will you say “somethings wrong with the cycle”..12-18 months after the halving (April-Oct 2025) as it has always been in every previous cycle.
8
If Bitcoin isn’t at 75k or above in 90 days I’m going to sell 66% of my stake and buy a few houses and some index funds...It’s not worth the stress unless it’s going to offer face melting returns.
9
Longest time it has ever taken BTC to reach a new ATH post halving is 219 days...219 days from the most recent halving on April 19th would be November 24th...We’re currently 135 days post halving and 21.4% below ATH...135 days post 2020 halving BTC was 47.6% below ATH...135 days post 2016 halving BTC was 36.6% below ATH...BTC is actually doing better than the two previous halvings at this point post halving but new ATH before the halving for the first time ever is messing with perception of just how well BTC is actually doing casually chilling in the $50k-$60k region 4.5 months post halving.

Very simple, study bitcoin power law:.https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/

If so today bitcoin must be lowered than 58K

how do we write a backward K

It’s pretty simple really. If this four-year cycle completes without performing like previous cycles then we can call it broken. I’m not sure why you’re so eager to call it dead before the really good part of the cycle even starts.
9
uh, easy. 4 year cycle says nothing about when ATHs *can* happen. only that the *cycle peak* ATH happens 12-18 months after the halving. anything that happens different than that is simply something interesting to look at
7
Reason for pre-halving ATH: ETF hype. Pretty simple. ..The cycles are only a historical trend caused by the reduction of new daily supply...They have no bearing on demand whatsoever, other than psychological ones, and demand can and did spike out of no where when ETFs launched.
2
not sure what your beef is.  4 year cycle, i.e. halving of block rewards, is part of the code.  it doesn't change

Even with diminishing returns, I would expect a 9.5x from the cycle low at a minimum. So $146,870 minimum. The multiplier decline from the 1st Era (before 1st halving) to 2 Era was 36.6x from the previous multiple. 2nd era to 3rd era was 17.4x. A 47.5% decrease. If you apply that to the 4th era, that would indicate a 9.5x. 9.5x$15460=$146,870..!bb predict > 146.8k December 31 2025..I think it will go higher, but that will also depend on if we get a recession some time in late 2025.

The EW adherents claim it works on all timeframes. My experience taught me that it works well for determining targets for intraday trading on timeframes from the 2H and lower. It served me for that but I try to avoid day trading because the cumulative stress takes a toll. There’s also the original Elliot Wave method, which was developed specifically for Forex trading, and New/Modern Elliot Wave, in which the old system was adapted to account for outliers in the original, such as trend channels and broadening & narrowing wedges. Some folks on here are pretty good with those. What folks often fail to do with EW is look the hardest for invalidating indicators and then dismiss that EW read. That’s what has given it a bad rep among traders. Personally, I’ve theorized that it works well in particular market conditions yet fails in others. When I retire and have more free time, I’ll likely try to identify those particular conditions and codify a system for when to use it.
5
Additionally and more specifically to your question, New EW claims that waves follow symmetry through time and one can thus predict the timing of particular moves. I highly doubt those folks are correct. There are simply too many fundamental variables that can enter the equation over time for that to work repeatedly and reliably.
2
The move could overshoot with an extended 5th wave. However, if the 3rd is extended, that will not happen. That’s a reliable indicator pattern. Once the 5th wave finishes, though, EW traders would long the incoming bounce and use fibs to establish take profit targets on that long. The first wave of this move is not that deep so one would expect an extended 3rd wave, according to the system. The fact that it bottoms near horizontal res serves as a validator of the EW read.

Woah woah woah, let’s not get all hasty. It’s tomorrow.

September 2nd. The date that had been foretold  (by a member of this sub) as the beginning of Super Up.
1
Id rather offer a more realistic perspective than those who think October will be the start of a pump for no real reason besides it happening four years ago. The message may not be popular, but the bull hopium on this subreddit needs a counter perspective as well. No one is considering that 2024 may be a red year... Still a decent ways to go, but the trend is down.
1
The volatility is being sucked out of btc which in itself really sucks.
1
Oh I remember that meme cup - June 18th was supposed to be "the date" it confirmed. Also I don't think we're in a bull run because price hasn't really built off it's highs and we're still below previous cycle ATH. We basically had five months of bullish action from October to March and six months later now people think we're still in a bull run despite nothing happening since then. I think the bullrun was short and sweet and characterized by the 26k to 74k move we already saw. We had a good five months, now we are just crabbing (pessimistically bearing, but I wouldn't go that far *yet*).
0
IMO when an ATH is reached and bull market ends lets say it then takes a couple of years for price to revisit the previous ATH after a sell off...Once price approaches the previous ATH, IMO 2 things happen in a real bull market…..* ATH is reached and price just slices through it like it’s nothing and prints a new ATH. Price then sells off and the previous ATH is tested, holds like a boss and then price prints ATH after ATH after ATH, this should go on for a few months...OR..* ATH is reached, price sells off for a few weeks and then price revisits ATH, breaks through and then prints ATH after ATH after ATH, this should go on for a few months...If we look at BTC, it reached the $69k ATH and then a few days later printed a new ATH of $73k and then just traded sideways and down for 5 MONTHS. This is not bullish behaviour, its LIMP DIK behaviour!
-3
Massive multi year cup & handle is actually back in play with bottom of handle now being $49.1k...Length of time from ATH on March 14th to bottom of handle on August 5th is 144 days. So, perfectly symmetrical handle on the multi year cup & handle formation, if it were to play out would be 144 days from August 5th or December 27th. However, in a textbook cup & handle formation the second half of the handle is typically shorter in length than the first half of the handle.
-2
Well thats seems to be the case...
1
See the bottom chart:..[https://imgur.com/a/btc-charts-1-sep-2024-ZoOAXa9](https://imgur.com/a/btc-charts-1-sep-2024-ZoOAXa9).."BTC is actually doing better than the two previous halvings at this point post halving" is one way of putting it.  Another way is to put it is to point out the price would be $75K-$80K at this point past halving based on the last two cycles.
0
What if you compare the BTC price 135 days post halving to the price on the date of the halving? I believe this is the only epoch with negative returns this far into the cycle, but haven't looked into it too much. ..Past doesn't predict the future.
-1
Some people hate the power law model because it puts a cap on the upside (price not likely to go more than 2 standard deviation above the trendline).  I like it because it puts a floor on the downside...In the end, only time will prove or disprove the validity of the model.  Until then it's as good a number as any to plug into my spreadsheets.
2
ꓘ
6
I'm eager to call it dead because imo the pre halving ATH already killed it...Id argue were already not performing like previous cycles as well. Down about 15% 135 days after the halving, at this point in every previous cycle BTC already has decent gains from the price on the halving date. Very short time frame  I know, but your definition leaves a lot open to interpretation and im playing devils advocate here.
0
The previous cycle peak occurred 46 months after the halving, no?
-8
Devil's advocate: the ETF hype caused a demand shock stronger than a typical halving, causing the bull run blow off top earlier and lower than anticipated. ...My biggest fear is that this was the 2024/2025 run and we're about to head into a recession which will be risk off (BTC, tech) before the next bull run in 4ish years. ...So many people here are expecting a guaranteed run to $100k+ by the end of 2025 that it scares me. Once something becomes too obvious to too many people, that's when things get shaken up to keep people guessing. 
8
That doesn't really answer my question. According to the 4 year cycle the ATH should not have been broken until after the halving. The ATH was actually broken one month before the halving in 2024. How does that not invalidate the 4 year cycle? Or is the 4 year cycle saying that we will peak 12-18 months after the halving? Which if that's the case, again, it's been invalidated as the "cycle" peak from 2020-2024 occurred 46 months after the halving. ..So imo I believe the March break of 69k kills the 4 yr cycle theory. The catalyst that caused the ATH at that time is irrelevant and it's only hindsight that we can say it was because of ETF hype. Imo, that WAS the reason, but we can't A/B test and know with 100% certainty that we wouldn't have broken the ATH even if ETFs were not approved (FWIW, I think this viewpoint is absurd, but I'm playing devil's advocate)... I believe the 4 year cycle has already been broken.

No beef, just asking questions and trying to stir discussion to earn more about why people think the cycle is still intact.

What’s interesting under the hood is that a 6 month chop period alone is not necessarily a bearish thing. But what’s bearish is that tradfi and equity markets have essentially been on fire during this period while Btc stagnated. The downside reflexivity is even worse on down days in tradfi. Also alt markets, including coin #2 traditionally a measure of risk appetite have already broken down from their supposed accumulation ranges to the downside. Although most Btc maxis including myself included are in favor of shitcoins dying, they could also be a leading indicator for what’s soon to come in Btc in terms of price action and breaking the range downwards.

multi-year cup and handle never left. the handle can be about 1/3 to 1/2 the length of the cup, which in this case is a longgg handle due to the size of the cup...https://i.redd.it/8svehvit08md1.png
6
This chart is in relation to where price was at during halving...Also need to take into account BTC was far below ATH price at time of previous halvings whereas this time BTC was just 13.9% below ATH at time of halving...I think a reasonable middle ground stance would be, since BTC was much closer to ATH at time of halving and the longest time it has ever taken BTC to reach new ATH post halving is 219 days, BTC should reach new ATH sometime before November 24th, not after...By then, outcome of presidential election will be in the rear view mirror and Fed will likely have cut Fed funds rate by at least 50 BP.
1
"A floor on the downside", exactly!...Though about the upside, the limit would be 500k$ end of 2025, which is a number nobody dares to envision right at this moment.
2
>at this point in every previous cycle BTC already has decent gains from the price on the halving date..The price was also below the previous ATH. Where BTC 1st ATH came very early in the cycle. ..You are the pot calling the kettle black with your "the 4 year cycle is dead" zealotry. ..>I'm eager to call it dead because imo the pre halving ATH already killed it...Historically the 4 phases of the cycle are Accumulation (phase 1), Growth (phase 2), Bubble (phase 3) and finally the Crash (phase 4). I think BTC is at the end the accumulation phase. ATH doesn't need to happen after the halving to keep the cycle intact. If we are in 2025 and no new ATH then you can start banging your drum the cycle is broken. Until then, you really don't have any real evidence the cycle is over.
4
willfully ignorant. good luck!

It's not a video game. For the price to fall people need to sell. The lower the price, the more it means well positioned people risking to time the market / old timers exiting the market, and more people selling at a loss. And people don't like to sell at a loss or lower than their goals, you can see it with the people whining in these threads but staying in position, or in the housing market. Traders including myself love to buy when the streets are bloody. Bear markets are usually violent because everybody is up so much and/or there are systemic fails...The ETF bull run was rather obvious and it still happned... Second paragraph is valid, but it's the usual recession predict we have since 2019. It's a bit hard to imagine a sudden shift unless China shits the bed.
3
I have seen many compare that to the 2019 move with extra power because of the ETF. Going to depend on QE and whether we get a recession. I still think September or October will spark the next rally. Pretty confident we hit an ATH before year’s end and have two power moves left in the cycle. ..What would throw everyone off though is that if earlier in the year was a 2019 move, that would mean we don’t move for a while and have a top in 2026, which would be well beyond what everyone anticipates. Almost everyone would say the top is in and the bear is go and many will drop and then they will push it to higher levels. It’s not something I see others saying which makes it a possibility. ..But for now, if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it. We are still right in line with prior cycles and the next 10 months should be fun.
2
Could be. We’ll see!
1
The 4 year cycle theory is that the change in supply issuance affects the price in predictable cycles. ..Again, it speaks nothing to demand or other factors that can influence the price, up or down.

Oh I totally agree with you about alts. 40-50k range is definitely in play right now unless something changes.

IMO fed fund rates being cut is bearish, I know it sounds counter intuitive, if money is cheaper, assets should be more expensive but historically when rates are cut and the yield curve uninverts its a sign that economic headwinds are here...Do you agree with that assessment and if so I guess you are of the opinion that BTC will be shielded from any economic trouble and will prosper in 2025, with ATH after ATH culminating in a blow off top towards the end of 2025?..IMO I just can't see how BTC can bitch slap a global recession when in H1 2020 it crashed like a bitch, just like everything else...Fascinated to see how this plays out.
-1
Judging by the last paragraph you wrote, you would believe that the 4 year cycle is intact even if the high between now and EOY 2025 is say, 75K? That seems wrong to me and not a fair characterization of the "4 year cycle". Can you expand on this point, I think I'm misunderstanding you.  .  .My entire point is that by surpassing what most people define as the "cycle" peak of 69K one month before the halving, we have broken all previous patterns... including the 4 year cycle pattern, where traditionally the previous "cycle" ATH is not broken until 6-12 months AFTER the halving... what am I missing here? ..Or is the "cycle" peak 73.8K? In which case, we have \~6 more months to break that level to still be in accordance with the theory. But then I also see most people say that the cycle peak occurs 12-18 months after the halving, and our ATH occurred 46 months after the 2020 halving.

The entire market is manipulated, the news you read is manufactured, etc. The elite maintain their wealth and status by stealing from the working class. Keeping them poor keeps them busy little slaves.  ...> People don't like selling at a loss ...They don't, but sometimes their hand is forced if they lose their jobs and need to survive.

That seems to be a different definition than what most 4 yr cycle believers claim. Your definition leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and honestly is something I can agree with to an extent as an issuance reduction should in theory be a bullish catalyst...Where I disagree with the believers is in their sentiment that a "face melting, epic bullruns of insane proportions will occur 6-12 months after the halving and cause Bitcoin to skyrocket 3-6X in a short period of time."..I guess my viewpoint is that we should moderate our expectations. The 4 year "cycle" is real in the sense that issuance DOES get cut in half every four years, but that on it's own doesn't imply anything about price. If it did, Litecoin (and countless other shitcoins) would be on the moon by now. Do you disagree?

Hello u/Existential-Cringe..[You predicted the price of Bitcoin would drop below $56,201.00 by Sep 02 2024 23:59:59 UTC](/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1f65ngc/daily_discussion_sunday_september_01_2024/ll0p5ua/)..**Unfortunately your prediction was wrong. Better luck next time!**..The price of Bitcoin when this prediction was created: $57,874.66. The price of Bitcoin when this prediction was triggered: **$59,150.66**

Textbook definition of a recession is two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP. By that definition, we already experienced a minor recession fairly recently from Q1 thru Q2 of 2022...Whereas now GDP in Q2 came in at a positive number, 3.0%. We could technically be in a recession now beginning in Q3 but won’t know Q3 GDP numbers until October and won’t have Q4 GDP numbers until January to be able to confirm two consecutive quarters of negative GDP at the absolute earliest, assuming Q3 GDP numbers come in negative at all...There’s a big difference between now and 2020 in terms of the positioning the Fed is currently in to be able to combat a recession. In the event of a recession, the Fed has a ton of runway to work with as they’ve been cutting their balance sheet via QT for the past 2 years by $1.8 trillion and they can slash rates way down as Fed funds rate is currently at 5.4%, the highest it’s been in more than two decades...So I doubt we get a recession and even if we do I don’t think it will be severe, pretty minor and short lived if anything. Also, I think BTC is much more of a pure play on monetary debasement than equities are. In addition to monetary debasement, equities need to factor in earnings for pricing and a recession where unemployment increases substantially would result in lower expected earnings for companies. Whereas with BTC there’s no earnings to factor in, just monetary debasement so if monetary debasement is accelerating, that should create an environment where BTC vastly outperforms equities.

Technically, it would be intact, it would be very disappointing, but still following the cycle. In your scenario, the ATH would still happen in the Bubble phase. Then BTC would enter the Crash Phase. Then the cycle would repeat...>That seems wrong to me and not a fair characterization of the "4 year cycle..It is fair because it is what the basic cycle describes. Just because you don't like it does mean it isn't accurate. You are adding all the other theories out there to it to justify that it is dead. The cycle is very basic. Accumulation (phase 1), Growth (phase 2), Bubble (phase 3) and Crash (phase 4). Everything else is extra and open to interpretation.
1
4 year cycle is simply that it will go up higher than last ath in new cycle. Hasn't it already validated this? 4 year cycle already validated unless it hasn't gone higher than 69k after halving.
2
I’m sure you’ll find a million different definitions on twitter and even here. But the one I described is the only one that makes economic sense, to me at least. ..The 4 year cycle isn’t going anywhere, not until latest next year, at the earliest. ..Until then, it can’t be called dead, because we don’t know what will happen before then, even if you insist otherwise. Which seems like a pointless exercise btw, because everyone else will just wait and see.
2
If we top out at 75k in the next 15 months it implies we never entered phase 3. What am I missing?
-2
It seems like no one can agree on what the 4 year cycle even means...is a cycle halving to halving? If so, then by your definition, 73.8K is the threshold we need to surpass - which occurred 46 months after the 2020 halving, \*not\* 12-18 months after, which seems to be a common talking point of the "theory"...BTW your definition seems to set a very low bar for BTC and doesnt seem to be consistent with any other definitions of the 4 year cycle I've seen. According to your criteria, you would still claim the 4 year cycle is intact if we break 69K/73.8K in February 2028 even if we stay below 60K the entire time between now and then.
1
Fair enough! Let's see where we are in q4 2025. For my own sake I hope the "cycle" plays out like it has previously, but as you can probably tell, I have my doubts.
0
>If we top out at 75k in the next 15 months it implies we never entered phase 3..Why? It would still be a new all time high, the cycle would still depend on what happens in the Crash phase before you could call the cycle dead. Like I said. "It would be very disappointing, but still following the cycle."
2
People have had their doubts every cycle that I’ve been here. ..Those doubts have always been dead wrong. ..I remember a similar debate at $8k and the other guy sold because I and others weren’t convincing enough I guess. We tried. Sucks for him.
2
Can you explain why/how a rise to 75k over the next 15 months would be considered a bubble? That seems just like a slow steady rise to me. ..For a bubble, see previous parabolic gains - 10-60k October to March 2020-2021, 26-74k September to March 2023/2034, etc.
-4
An economic bubble is a period when current asset prices greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify...“The cycle would still depend on what happens in the Crash phase before you could call the cycle dead.”..If BTC drops 50-80% then the $75K was a bubble. The cycle would still be intact.
2
Yea thats fair, I guess I don't see a 50-80% crash in this hypothetical situation because we would never had the euphoria thats caused by a rapid increase in price and been associated with all previous btc bubbles. ..Off topic, but I also appreciate how you instantly downvote my responses lol (assuming that is you because my post seems to immediately be at 0 whenever I respond). Not that I care, just find it disappointing that my attempts at being a HQ member and engaging in thoughtful discussion are not appreciated simply because I don't share a consensus viewpoint.

It’s very simple. Unless you need money tomorrow or in the next couple months where would you put your dollars? You can pick stocks, bonds, real estate, leave it in cash, fiat is a fun word we’ve all picked up, even Warren Buffett is going there. ..Your choice, my horse is the fastest and most accessible, if you compare whatever app you use to research, bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade. Diminishing returns? Sure but show me another 10 year asset that hasn’t done the same and I’ll allocate some money there. ..I do appreciate the trading sub part so I’ll contribute that the daily and shorter time frames look a little negative, 53k is my daily local low IF we go down again. Weekly and monthly timeframes/moving averages are strong positives and I’ll ride those trends until they break. See you in 12 months.

What do you all think the BTC.D will end up at (as the top) for this cycle?
5
Price-wise, this feels most like 2019, where we had an early initial summer peak and then we just kind of slow bled down slowly the rest of the year...Then, just like it was now - it wasn't apparent that we had hit a mid-cycle peak until many months later. By then, it was too late to sell anyway...I just remember holding through the summer and it being a very boring time-period the same way it has been lately..The bad news is that if we are following a similar pattern to 2019, this could mean no new ATH this year. Many early projections of 90-100k this summer and even into fall/winter/Q4 could be pushed back farther or even delayed to 2025 or later (in the absence of a covid-type black swan event)

On this very quiet Saturday, looks like a new Bitcoin pricing model just dropped for review and scrutiny. I’m just going off the scant glance I had at X this morning, but my understanding is that Saylor posted a model he calls a power law, based on Bitcoin’s market cap. And the main power law guy Santostassi doesn’t agree with it. ..Anyone follow this or have any opinions of it? Or a TLDR of what Saylor proposes?
4
Sometimes it best just to lay it out in writing instead of candle sticks…..BTC ATH of $69,000 lands on November 10th 2021...ATH of $69,000 broken on March 5th 2024 with BTC topping out at $73,835 on March 14th 2024. That is an increase of 7%…..BTC then sells off 33% hitting a low of $49,050 on August 5th 2024...Today’s August close will probably be around about $59k...I appreciate that (all / some) of the 4 year cycle crew think that 2024 = 2019 and that the blow off peak will most likely occur in Q4 of year 3 (Oct-Dec ’25). IMO eventually that occurrence will break, it cannot just keep repeating, it will break...What if it already has…

No way to track it, Gox still has 2.6 billion worth to distribute as well, but they have until the end of October to complete the payouts. I would expect any of them with a life changing amount of coins to sell.

feels like i can interpret your question two ways. 1) what the BTC.D top will be for this cycle, 2) what BTC.D will be near the price top for this cycle...we're pretty close to an interesting BTC.D trendline right now. this would say about 60% as the BTC.D cycle top but ideally it will go much higher than that. i'd like to see bitcoin go on a price run versus alts and hit at least 70% BTC.D...https://i.redd.it/h0de897tv1md1.png..for where BTC.D will be near the price top, the top of alt season in early 2018 we hit 35% (just a few weeks after price top). top of alt season in 2021 we hit 40% (just a few weeks after price top). so, 45% this cycle would fit nicely in that...it would also match what could be a relatively muted alt season in comparison to previous cycles because there will be is more money in BTC ETFs and it'll be harder for BTC ETF profits to funnel directly into alts...as you can see, in full shitcoin frenzy mode BTC.D tanks pretty rapidly. this has historically been a good indicator that we're approaching a bitcoin top because euphoria is getting out of hand. anything under 50% and i'm going to be paying real close attention. under 47% will trigger one of my indicators saying that it could be a good time to start taking profits...https://i.redd.it/p47xt767v1md1.png
7
I think it will top out 61-62 before temporarily going down when btc consolidates again, simply because of the massive number of alts getting churned out daily.
2
Hopefully 100% (not realistic I know). Shitcoins need to disappear, they're a complete stain on BTC...Realistically, 65-70%. But depends on if you want to include stables or not.

Why does everything have relate to another period of time ?..Why can’t if just be:..We had an early year pump due to ETF’s..We have stalled due to a bit of uncertainty and a potential recession ..Just suffered lots of selling pressure from Gox, Germany selling etc...Now the markets are working out the next move...I prefer to live in the “now”

the model is interesting (and novel to me at least) because it looks at market cap and not price. most other power laws i have seen are price focused

slight mistype there. 2024 = 2020 instead of 2019. 4 year cycle works in 4 year increments. 2013/2017/2021/2025 tops, 2012/2016/2020/2024 year before tops (in the 4 year cycle theory)...bitcoin never got over $69k in 2021 but it got real close. if you were one of the lucky few who sold the 2 days it was over 68k, 13 days over 64k, or 32 total days over 62k, then good job!..based on what you said ("IMO eventually that occurrence will break, it cannot just keep repeating, it will break."), i can see 4 options for the 4 year cycle:..1. the 4 year cycle is real and it hasn't hit yet. if you think this is the case, then the peak shouldn't happen until 2025. that would mean every day between now and then is an amazing buying opportunity. you could set some price alerts, configure autobuys, and do other things. conclusion: there will be better sell opportunities in the future...2. the 4 year cycle is real but it hit early based on ETF hype. if you think this is the case, then following the 4 year cycle, you would expect a significant dump and a rebuy opportunity 12 months after the peak. that would mean the best plan is to sell everything now and buy back in much lower in March 2025. conclusion: there will be better sell opportunities in the future...3. the 4 year cycle is broken - it won't go up anymore. if you think this is the case, then 74k was the all-time peak and the best plan would be to sell everything. conclusion: there will not be better sell opportunities in the future...4. the 4 year cycle is broken - it will *always* go up now. if you think this is the case, then the halving cycles, global liquidity cycles, or whatever you think has caused the 4 year cycles up to this point is no longer valid; however, you think bitcoin has great potential and can go to ATH anytime here on out. if you think this is the case, then the best plan would be to set some price alerts, keep stacking, and do other things. conclusion: there will be better sell opportunities in the future...3/4 are better opportunities in the future, 1/4 is game over. i like those odds...which option do you think aligns most with your current thinking? is that thinking based on anything other than your gut feeling?
13
> I appreciate that (all / some) of the 4 year cycle crew think that 2024 = 2019..That's 5 years, not 4...The "4 year cycle crew" think 2024 resembles 2020, not 2019...In 2020, the halving was in May.  This year, the halving was in April...In 2020, Bitcoin started to really climb in November.  This year, I've been looking toward October for the next big move up...2024 feels different than previous cycles because ETFs were launched in January, which was still part of the previous cycle.  ETFs brought in an entirely new class of investors, which led to a huge pre-halving pump, and it's why data from 2024 will never match up with other years.
9
you are overthinking it, usd denominated price levels for Bitcoin and corresponding dates, ath broken or not with respect to previous cycles - it's all meaningless. Bitcoin is not a stock to perform, for Christ sake. And what is dollar by the way? truth is nobody knows anymore yet everybody thinks it's still money. well, it's not, however we trade it against Bitcoin back and forth and then get rich in Bitcoin. that's all there is to it. for me at least
9
How much was bitcoin after halving 2020 september? $11,985 it was off almost 50 percent. Today we are off from 20 percent from ath. We just need to wait until october 2024. We will see some movement. I dont lose my hope.

Becoming a part of tradfi was bound to happen as bitcoin matures. As it matures, its market cap increases, its liquidity increases, competition becomes more severe, increased popularity means regulations come into play, enforcement of regulations means illegal market activities become more difficult (eg, price manipulations by single or a few wealthy entity become increasingly unlikely, exchanges don't engage in shady activities, etc), increased liquidity means opportunities for profitability for the big guys in tradfi, big guys in tradfi start trading bitcoin, and finally bitcoin and main crypto become more and more integrated into tradfi and more and more similar to tradfi. (Shitcoins are a different story.)..Bitcoin is nothing special. In the perspective of us investors and traders, all assets are fundamentally the same, in the sense that they are nothing more than a means to make profit. I trade FX, commodities, stocks, and stock indices, and I treat bitcoin the same way I treat them. You should, too.

rancid fucking weakness for 6 months can be explained by the fact that over 500k coins have been dumped  by gox, german gov, OG whales, etc...When you take that into consideration the price action is pretty bullish

Everything you said here is indeed factual, however it’s sometimes helpful to view prior price behavior in this and other markets as a frame of reference for potential price behaviors . The same way others have used cycle theory to predict the next market cycle to 100k+ . Nobody questions this ? Also the fact that everyone is so defensive when a less than bullish prediction is made gives even more credence to this possibility coming true

We can only connect the dots looking backward.

Kreuger and Santostassi work super closely together and have very similar outlooks in pricing models. They are doing a video convo about Saylor’s model vs Santostassi’s model early next week, will be interesting to see the comparison (taken with a grain of salt given the biased source). I am following the Santostassi power law model’s performance closely this cycle, am considering moving to this metric next cycle.

Two problems with using market cap:..1) It neglects lost coins, which should not be included in the market cap since they cannot represent real world economic goods/services. ..2) It neglects the important effect of volume - in low volume trading market caps are much less robust.
4
4 year cycle as I understand is LOW 2 LOW...2014 - 2018 / 2018 - 2022 / 2022 - 2026..In terms of price action in my opinion the pump and dump of 2019 will occur in 2024, the resemblance is there no doubt after 8 months, lets see how the rest of the year plays out...In terms of price action (I disregard the halving) I think 2024 = 2019 and therefore 2025 = 2020...I believe the cycle that we are currently in is not a 4 year cycle but a lengthening cycle. In the remaining 4 months of the 2024 if BTC cannot break the $69k ATH then I think that will confirm that 2024 is indeed more like 2019, than 2020 (ATH $19.6 was broken in Nov '20)...But having said that maybe 2025 then goes onto be like 2021…who knows lol...For clarification I’m not short nor long, my reasoning for my comment is that I believe 2025 will be a recession year and therefore BTC 4 year cycle can’t peak in Q4 of 2025. I mean it can but in a global recession, I find that hard to believe but lets see what happens...Reasoning behind recession belief is that central banks over tighten, hold rates "high" for 12 months, realise oh shit woops, bring down rates, too late damage done, recession.

For many people, most here I bet, Bitcoin is an investment. They plan to convert back to USD when the time is right, so its USD price is very important. The vast majority of people invested in Bitcoin do not plan to just to hold it as Bitcoin forever.

do price power law models take into account lost coins or volume?

> 4 year cycle as I understand is LOW 2 LOW...The 4 year cycle for Bitcoin is from halving to halving.  Each halving cuts the block reward in half.  And since block rewards are the only way new Bitcoin is created and added to the supply, each Bitcoin cycle reflects the fiat price during a period of each block reward value...It will help you understand Bitcoin if you learn to think in Bitcoin rather than thinking in dollars, or whatever your local currency is...> In terms of price action (I disregard the halving)..Then you don't understand Bitcoin, and you'll always end up frustrated because you're missing an important part of the supply: the constant incoming flow of newly mined coins, which gets cut in half once every four years...The price of Bitcoin is the price at which supply meets demand.  How many coins are being sold and how much are buyers willing to pay to get 'em.  That's the price...The supply of coins being sold includes newly mined coins that miners are selling.  The block rewards.  This is the part of the overall market which the halving effects...In 2012, before the halving, 50 BTC were being mined every 10 minutes.  After the halving, it was 25 BTC being mined every 10 minutes...In 2016, before the halving, 25 BTC were being mined every 10 minutes.  After the halving, it was 12.5 BTC being mined every 10 minutes...In 2020, before the halving, 12.5 BTC were being mined every 10 minutes.  After the halving, it was 6.25 BTC being mined every 10 minutes...This year, before the halving, 6.25 BTC were being mined every 10 minutes.  After the halving, it dropped to 3.125 BTC being mined every 10 minutes...In order to understand Bitcoin, think in Bitcoin.

what do you feel it is that drives the market such that if we had a recession in 2025 we would expect bitcoin's price to surge to new ATHs in 2026? feels like that's a pretty tight turnaround from recession to cycle peak...the pump and dump you were talking in 2019 seems to have already happened this year, with the peak of that in March. let's call 2019 and March 2024 mid-cycle peaks. if that's the case, then we're nearing the end of the mid-cycle correction. in 2019, being in that same position meant ~12 months to the euphoria peak (in April 2021). that would also fit nicely into the end of 2025 peak theory...https://i.redd.it/6hbqv9ykzvld1.png

some of it sure, every now and then, like 2-5% with the right timing. but all of it? and for what? the only thing I would in part agree to exchange it would be good delivery gold bars by lbma.

THIS...People hold BTC so that one day they can convert it to FIAT so that they can buy things and experiences that they simply otherwise would not be able to afford.

How high is your average buy price for you to be acting this neurotic?

Average price, floor price, peak price. Pick any you like.

understood, but then it's an overall mix of numbers and words. just messy which is why the percentages idea is best.

You're misreading, its not saying it only fell below the fair value once during covid. ..Its saying it only fell below the entire range bottom (which ranges well below the fair value itself) once, which they use to calculate the fair value. ..Its just the giovanni range again, if you've seen it, repackaged as a "fair value". ..Here's the entire thing: https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/

Guess that we wither slash through 100k or we can't even make it
2
no, but price power laws have not shown to be good predictive models either.
2
For me the 4 year cycle is to be measured from LOW to LOW. I don't think I said in my comment BTC peaks in 2026, I don't know when it will peak (assuming Q4 '25 peak don't happen)...If we have a recession in 2025 and BTC sells off then the PEAK would have been March 2024 at $73k...The usual way out of a recession is money printer go brrrrr with rates at ZERO, this will boost all asset prices and away we go. What the low of BTC will be I dont know, maybe it was $15k in 2022 or maybe its $15k in 2025 or maybe even $8k in 2025...I believe BTC is not something that is recession proof. We shall see, no issues if I'm wrong, I got no skin in the game.

There are tons of reasons. A lot of people are in a lot of debt. Or they want a down payment to buy a house. Or to pay off their mortgage. Or to pay for an experience like a special vacation. Everyone has different priorities and for some people, making life changing money is good enough.** Now they want to use that money to actually change their life...** "Life changing money" means different things to different people. I'm not necessarily talking about millions or generational wealth. I'm literally talking about enough money to change the direction of your life for the better.

I’ll probably celebrate 100k with a kilo of gold. I sold all my precious metals for coin long ago - I still have a hobby pouring copper and aluminum - and I wouldn’t mind getting some because reasons (mainly it’s fun to play with). ..Pouring a kilo of gold into a bitcoin logo would be cool.

I'm in it for the tech.

Organic is no paper bitcoin, no options trading, no multibillion dollar sell walls and shorts. ..It’s clear that this is a tradfi asset now. It’s not for you and me and we won’t see explosive gains until they want  (if ever)
-5
No such thing as a floor price. And I refuse to believe a six month window with negative returns is the best six months in BTC history, that makes no sense.
3
it's already a mix of numbers and words, but yeah agree that percentages sounds like the best approach...Also, sorry if these comments seem dickish, I think it's a very cool table that helps convey what I've been trying to say here recently - we're having a good year.

Just looked again ….. cheers...Looks a good to to buy then 💪
1
the ones i've seen haven't done too bad of a job. data for this one i believe was from 2018 and the rest is the expected regression fit. green is the actual power law line. ..https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/..if price power laws don't take into account lost coins or volume, and neither do market cap power laws, i'm not entirely sure i understand what you were getting at earlier. is there a power law that takes lost coins and volume into account?
3
oh sorry i took when you said "I believe the cycle that we are currently in is not a 4 year cycle but a lengthening cycle" to mean a peak in 2026. i guess i should ask, if it does indeed lengthen, what does that look like for you? 4 year cycle theory by halvings and tops would say the next bear market bottom should be in 2026...> I got no skin in the game..also can you explain this lol. just tracking bitcoin's price as a hobby?
5
Generational wealth is on the table for many here.
3
Short it

I mean the lowest price during the last 6 months is way higher than any other 6 months period bitcoin has had.
8
feedback is always welcome :) the goal is for the information to be easily understood
2
I’m literally all in now after seeing this !
1
The power law only looks decent on a graph if you put "days from genesis block" as the x-axis variable (taking the log, obviously). But then you also have to allow an x-intercept, which makes no sense, because that would mean that bitcoin was worth **negative trillions of dollars** in 2010. If you instead start the x-axis when bitcoin was first traded for usd, then the fit is horrible. ..Really the power law just takes advantage of the fact that if you put some data really far away from the x-origin on a log-log scale it's really easy to make it look like a straight line because of how much it's been artificially scrunched together. ..Even with the contrived power law, you will be off on today's price by a factor of 3 or more depending on what years of data you use to try and predict it. If you start at 2011, for example, which is 80% of the log space until 2024 (meaning it should more than enough to predict today's price), it gives a price of $10,000,000. ..The power law model has no predictive power, it's just a convenient way to make things look like a line for the time being. If you really want to see this, plot a point for every time bitcoin was $0 from the genesis block until it first entered the market at $0.01, you'll see how bad the power law really is.
3
I follow BTC price action because it’s like a puzzle to me. Can I guess correctly or am I way off the mark. ..Halving means nothing to me, it’s priced in. I believe markets price an asset today based on known forward information. If the halving was random and no one knew about it in advance then boy would that mean something because upon discovery price would move hard...So how do I see BTC play out?..2022 marked the last clean 4 year LOW to LOW cycle...So November 2022 started a new cycle but not a 4 year cycle, a lengthening cycle. The first peak came in March 2024 at just 7% higher, the actual blow off peak in excess of $200k I think occurs in 2027 / 28...But before then I predict BTC sells off throughout 2025 because of recession, $15k may not hold, could go lower...Sideways in 2026 then up and up in 2027 and 2028 as the money printer goes brrrrr.
0
Maybe, but most people are content with less and that's fine. Not everyone is shooting for generational wealth. They have bills to pay today, or dreams/goals they want to fulfill, and that's fine too.
2
Suppose that's fair but that doesn't mean it's the best six months in the assets history... That's just the quality of an asset that trends upwards over time
1
i feel like that's a lot of words to say you didn't even look at the link i posted :(..that chart uses data up to end of 2018 and in April of this year, ~5 years later, it got to within $1.1k of the power law line (actually only ~$383 if you count high price instead of end of day price). and that's not even at the end of the cycle yet...how do you reconcile that accuracy and the accuracy of the 2021 cycle (from an average basis) with the idea you said that "you will be off on today's price by a factor of 3"?..if your argument is that numbers are massaged until they fit expected results, then yes, i believe that's how nearly all models work. i do appreciate your distaste and seething hostility toward power laws though! i feel much the same away about most models.
4
> I follow BTC price action because it’s like a puzzle to me...Part of the reason it's a puzzle is because you don't understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin.  I'm not saying that to be mean.  I'm saying it to encourage you to not analyze Bitcoin like it's a stock, or as a traditional asset like gold.  I see so many dudes doing that while drawing lines on charts, but their analysis is usually a mess because they don't understand the fundamentals of the asset they're analyzing...Bitcoin began in January 2009 with 50 BTC total...Every 10 minutes (roughly), another 50 BTC were created and given to whoever created the next block on the blockchain.  This is the Block Reward...Every 4 years (roughly), the block reward gets cut in half.  This is The Halving...This *every 10 minutes & every 4 years* pattern will continue until a total of 21 million Bitcoin have been created...That means:..The total supply is known...The current supply is known...And the rate of growth of the supply is and always will be known...Because the growth of the supply of Bitcoin keeps getting cut in half every 4 years, it also means the rate of inflation gets cut in half every 4 years.  Fun fact: Bitcoin's inflation rate is now lower than the Dollar's inflation rate, and in 2028 it will again be cut in half...All of this is automatic...All of this is known...No other asset behaves this way.  No other asset has ever behaved this way...That's why just looking at dates and numbers on a chart will never give you enough of the information you need to understand why Bitcoin's price behaves the way it does.

if you haven't yet, i would recommend the book "Broken Money: Why Our Financial System is Failing Us and How We Can Make it Better" by Lyn Alden. it's not a bitcoin book but it does touch on it. if you look at the bitcoin technology and why such a technology is needed, it might change your mind about just being a spectator...also, those are some bold predictions! let's track them so that we can you on the [leaderboard](https://bittybot.net/predictions)...!bb predict >200k December 31 2028 /u/lowprofitmargin

People will say anything to justify their said investment in this coin , all I see is a bunch of copium on the threads everyday . This is definitely not the best 6 months of this coin . It’s the crabbiest six, if anything. Very disappointing

Not only did I look at the link you posted, I downloaded the price history into R and ran the same logistic regression they did on that link using different time periods of data to use the numbers I referenced in my comment. Happy to show you more detailed results if you'd like, I work with data analysis for a living so it doesn't take me long.

I'm not sure if you live in the US, but there's a huge problem right now with costs of virtually everything being much higher than wages. Work doesn't satisfy basic needs any more, much less nice extras...Also, some people don't want to work if they don't have to. If they can retire from Bitcoin, I say  go for it. You only live once, why spend all day doing something you do want or have to do?..Bitcoin is meant to satisfy different objectives for different people.

but its at 59k per btc right now. i got my first one at 300 so this price is great for someone like me. last time i purchased btc was around 4000 just 4 years ago so even since then its been a great investment.

I got my first one at $800 and my first eth coin at $14. Past performance not indicative of future performance. We’re getting diminishing gains with each cycle , as clearly seen .
-1
Yes, I totally agree about the diminishing gains but I am happy with the gains that I have which was my point.  I think I got my first ones in 2010 cause I wanted to use Silk Road. Its been a good journey so far. ..These 6 months have been shit though, I agree there. I really thought we were off to the races when the etfs came in. I jumped in some alts and currently underwater on them about 20% which is frustrating.
1
Only down 20%? That should be considered a win, the alt market is decimated... BTC is down 20% from ATH but a ton of alts are down 90%+ from 2021 highs and 50-70% from March

Guess it all depends on september 6 NFP data..If good, we will go the to 90k before november..If not bull run is delayed to 2025..Anyway, ath before march 2025, so keep buying.
19
Bitcoin was $11.986 in 09/01/2020 and was off almost 50 percent of all time high. Today we are at $59,850 and we are 20 percent off from all time high (which we had second ath 2024)
13
Shorts/sell wall seem to pile up at 60k. Whales are absolutely hell bent on keeping it under and probably pushing it to low 50's..It doesn't help that there doesn't appear to be much spot buying at all.. it's all derivatives
10
look at the 1W chart, draw 2 trend lines, what do i see, it can drop to 40k and rise to 300k, don't look at the 1h chart, it's quite a roller coaster.
15
[Moonmath](https://www.moonmath.win/) accurate?

Not looking great, but not terrible either. Might look to hedge a bit with futures here., depending on US market open.

Supply continues to get reduced. It is only a matter of time until we get the supply shock that we though would have happened already with the ETFs. ..[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-low-price-retest-60k-bullish-analysts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-low-price-retest-60k-bullish-analysts)
17
Time crabitulation
11
Well I don’t know what’s gonna happen or when it’s gonna happen. But I do know that this cycle - more than in the last couple - the TA lessons of previous cycles are pretty much out the window. ..But I am confident that those who aren’t so far over their skis that a bumpy run will wipe them out, will be just fine in the long term.
10
Let us not forget: .The Halving was a real event. We all lived through it and mining has adjusted (or not) accordingly. The supply is shrinking, and if history teaches us anything, October/November will be interesting. The only indication of future behavior is past behavior. Positive platitudes are important. .Hands of diamond.

I have a decent bonus arriving in a week or so.. history says I won’t get to spend it on cheap Bitcoin.

The last time IBIT was net negative they sold the bottom (May 1st). However when the (non GBTC) ETFs were negative, it's a mix between timing well and selling the bottom. It seems like it's the first time they do it on choppy, doji days though. It lines up with the negative funding on my exchange.
4
Here's something to capture the current mood:..Every up and down..liquidations never stop..the wicks remind us
9
Don’t let the low T bears here fud you out of a position. ..Easy mode is about to start. US Dollar weakening, global liquidity increasing, risk assets on the brink of full send.
19
Although less frequent, another large dump starting right at 2:00 UTC.
8
Yeah might be taking back any prediction I made of a bullish September
12
Tipping in the rest of my stack and seeing what happens...Degeneracy always is the best policy right?..Premise is 65k is more likely than 55k based on volume. Let’s see.
12
[Liquidation map](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap) shows nearly vertical cumulative short liquidations through $62k on the 1 day chart, nearly vertical cumulative short liquidations through $65.7k on the 7 day chart, and nearly vertical cumulative short liquidations through $67.5k on the 30 day chart...Massive short squeeze underway? Lower highs acting as resistance to break on that pathway are at $64.9k, $65.5k, and $66.9k.
12
Let’s crush sentiment, so we can move upwards.💪
9
Fidelity's publication on volatility is worth a read imo. ..https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/closer-look-bitcoins-volatility..Although this was from May and some of these points are getting less compelling with each passing month.

which one is bearish and which one is bullish, A or B?..https://i.redd.it/u37ngi4w2wld1.png..in A, we went up 299% in 639 days. in B, we went up 372% in 639 days.
8
Looks like even 58k might break sometime today. Fuck this market.
11
Anyone know how many days BTC has set a new ATH since 2017? I think we had 3 days in 2024, can't imagine we had more than 20-30 in 2021... Just curious... It's been so long that BTC continually set new highs, I don't even remember what it feels like - hopefully I'll be reminded soon of why I'm overweight on magic internet bucks..And I will be selling some when we break the ATH because historically that seems like the wise move - holding BTC at ATH seems very risky compared to stocks at least
8
Question for those who’ve experienced multiple cycles - when has meme triangle like this ever NOT broken down..? [Chart](https://imgur.com/gallery/uDeis1P)
4
Question to the bulls on the sub: how many of you are still buying? Personally, I hit my target allocation a few months back and haven't bought since. It does kind of feel like everyone is just waiting to sell, which would align with and then invalidate the 4yr cycle theory.
10
rekt me more daddy...
8
Bitcoin has never had 2 consecutive red quarters in a “bull” market. We have 1 month to flip the current red candle, and the ultimate boss - historically red September - is in our way. Fuck.
3
On the bullish side, perhaps there's just another high volume retest of the $52-53k area. I have a parallel [trendline](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Aw7bILpg/) marked there. I've had it on my chart for months, but the dump to $49k perfectly touched it. Maybe there's some merit to this. Maybe something like [this. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HAQb1F99/)However, it's important to note that price is below all the major daily moving averages and price bumps continue to get aggressively sold. A breakdown from these trends is just as possible. I made a [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/uYtWT6qI-Even-if-This-Isn-t-Distribution-Consolidation-Could-Take-Months/) post for the first time in a while, demonstrating how price can essentially move sideways until December. The nearest downside target if this [big pattern ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/I6ZXqZqe/)turns out to be distribution is $32k or somewhere below $42k. Good luck out there! Still short. ..-Victor Cobra

I’ve been trying to avoid short-term trades yet have made 6 recently with 5 small wins and 1 small loss. Currently, the only trade I have set is a largish short near $71,500. It’s been there for awhile and I set it in case the Corn gets pumpy and will swing trade it back into a long when we catch a pullback on the way up.

Higher low seems gone now. Here comes 49

Sirs, there is no reason for it to go up currently as corn is waiting for me to buy at a sub 50k entry, which sadly i missed last time...Be patient, it will go up once im back in.

While it will do something, it does not “all depend” on NFP. CPI the following week will 100% have a greater effect on the price. Feel free to “!remindme” if you think I’m incorrect.
4
1 year between each ATH ought to humble everyone...Imagine this:..March 2024..March 2025..March 2026..4 yr cycle zealots get rekt, 73k March 2024, 77k March 2025, 81k March 2026. Eternal crab in between.
6
NFP will do NOTHING, don't kid yourself. Of course, it will be artificially-inflated by the powers that be to make it look good, this close to election. If anything, grandpa will pump on the initial report then will fade it just like every NFP, PPI, CPI speech before then...Something else needs to fundamentally change before a real reversal can occur other than these macro driven "eco-data reports" that have no lasting effect on BTC...The only thing it seems to do is give tradFi a reason to pump harder
4
60k wall is the new 70k unfortunately. ..There's not much spot buying because the excitement is gone, all the "good news" catalysts have been used up. all of these have failed to move prices up over the past 6 months. ..Only other thing that can propel is rate cuts, but we have known about those for awhile, so it's not new news. In fact, we sold off the latest Powell pump completely the same way we have sold off previous dovish CPI/PPI prints that last few months. ..Depending on who gets seated in the presidency, maybe that could be another catalyst but who knows where BTC will be by then...
13
Doesn’t that scream accumulation?
2
for the 90 day label, it says if you start with $67,491.42 and you go -12% then, if you continue to following that trend, you will reach over $79,432.82 never. yes, it is accurate that if you trend down you will not end up higher :)..there is at least 1 cell in that chart, though. were you asking about anything in particular?

I’ll play that signal. I just set a limit buy at $58,500. It should fill in less than a week or so, and we’ll see where it goes. It’s Fripayday for me anyway, and they always add that stanky USD fiat to my bank account.

The case for bitcoin grows stronger everyday
3
because of what happened that changed?
5
I’m 95% of the way to my stacking goal. I’m sticking to my weekly DCA, which means I’ll likely hit the goal in 4-6 weeks. I’m happy with that plan for now, but in a month I expect to be feeling some FOMO pressure to top it up to 100% and be done with it. I really want to be all in before November, October would be better.
5
[Short squeeze rather than long squeeze](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap) appears to be the path of least resistance as well.
4
I was thinking we get one more push to 63k-65k but not so sure looking at Gold/oil which looks to be topping which means DXY probably bottoming, might be it for BTC.
2
That's why they're aggressively defending it.
10
How do you read liquidation maps? They look messy and confusing.
4
Price has to go up for a short squeeze.
5
Can you ELI5?
1
both bullish obviously
2
And looks like last cycle's monthly high of 69k is being converted into support
2
Already broke slightly below...
4
we have more like a 6 months channel not a triangle
4
I buy blood and despair, whatever price.
12
You should never stop buy even if you hit your allocation a few months back. If you are talking about a diversified portfolio, then you should be buying every paycheck just like your automatic investments in other asset classes. Otherwise, you no longer have the allocation % you wanted to keep.
9
I don't have income and I'm out of dollars. I'm just waiting at this point.
8
10+ year holder, I still add little bits on what I feel are outsized dips- despite already being wayyyyy over exposed lol. Also with the ETFs out now, the last time I funded IRA I bumped up my FBTC position a bit after mostly buying VTI/VOO
9
I would still be buying every pay period if I had any cash left. I've already used available credit to buy BTC when it was quite a bit lower, and now am spending what's left over each pay for home renovations. With that said, yes I am planning to sell a good chunk to pay off some debt. Not planning on timing the top for that though..I think by nature of BTC literally being hard money, I don't believe the 4-year cycle will be invalidated. So long as enough people keep the DCA running, and adoption continues to increase, the supply halving has to make a difference every halving cycle. Even without the halving event one could expect BTC to have one long term direction, no?
9
This is my stance as well. I'm still (very) long term bullish, but too many people believe the 4yr cycle will give them free money this time. I don't think we'll hit a new ATH this year again. Hopefully before the end of 2025 though, but I'm not counting on it...My plan? Just hodl longer.
9
Buy spot every week.
11
which one is the bull market, A or B?..https://i.redd.it/jyzy9gx1yvld1.png..in A, we went up 2105% from the bear market bottom in 1100 days. in B, we went up 1020% in 550 days.
5
Bitcoin never seen new ath before halving as well.
4
I’m one of those people targeting a “way out”, and I know I’m not unique / the only one. I’d bet the majority of people posting here feel similar. Just reeks of major cope lately
3
56.5 first. idk if it gets there
7
>Here comes 49..By when are you thinking? Let's track it

I think you're confused... as soon as you buy, it's gonna dump. And as soon as you sell, it's going back up. Happens to all, from what I gather ;)

CPI is easy to predict, NFP is not. So the price shouldn't move a lot on CPI.

That actually isn’t a terrible theory.
5
No, but it could go on for another year or two.
12
I mean mainly on the popular macro indicators, starting with dropping below the previous cycles ATH in the bear, then breaking to a new ATH before the halving, then spending the longest time in history between posting a new ATH and continuing an extension, as well as not having the break of the dead-cat-bounce level into the trough of the last bear market *not* lead to a parabolic run. ..I guess a lot of this can be explained by the volume of capital coming in for early positioning with the ETFs. But it also tells me that the same forces can push things well outside of pretty much any of Bitcoiner’s accepted TA conventions.
2
I really can't comprehend the amount of 50-100x leveraged retards in both direction. Who the hell are these people.
8
I mean we’ve done nothing but hunt longs for the past three months, so I’d certainly hope so. That’s a pretty wildly off balance ratio though

If you scroll to the bottom of the link there’s a detailed description which, when used along with the legend on the chart, should help to understand.

if price moves up - it moves up violently, more so than if it moved down

Honestly, this market screams manipulation. This price action is not organic at all.
1
You sure about that
1
I'm overexposed as it is, I don't want or need more BTC. I'm actually looking forward to selling my first sats ever if we can get back up above 70k again - this market fucks with my head too much and the risk/reward seems to be strictly decreasing with time.

Oh yea? What’s CPI going to be?😂 a flux of simply +-0.3% would create significant volatility
2
Would be kind of terrible performance though... imagine telling someone in April 2021 when it was trading at 65K that BTC would max out at 81K in the next 5 years. Obviously though, this is just a hypothetical, and the future is wide open.

Btc spent a long 9 months in the $20-30k range, but once it left it never went back. The $50-70k range starting to feel similar, though it’s only been about 6 months so far.

Sigh... someone dumb went and got liquidated out of a 169BTC long 15m ago or so. Looks like 100x and a mere $150 retrace caught it. Jeez.....edit: it was this one: XBTUSD  $59107.5  $10.00M  22:02:57

IBIT (blue/orange), NVDA (green/red), and GLD (gold) YTD:..[https://www.tradingview.com/x/EGFEY5O7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EGFEY5O7/)..It is possible there is some optimal mix of the three, but I'm not smart enough to figure it out. Josh Brown had an interesting comment yesterday that NVDA was its own self-contained casino. Plenty of daily volatility and things like zero-day options to keep the folks that like that kind of thing happy. It may be that some of them used to use BTC for things like that. Not my field of expertise, so I'm just guessing here.
11
Im curious how many here are new (2023/24 entrants) vs those who told themselves they’d sell “next cycle” back in 2021 (or even 2017). “This cycle is my last” seems to be the consensus trade here, and that’s precisely why I don’t think it’ll happen
18
There's over 2B short liquidity till $62k and over 3B till $63k. 7d shorts dominate longs by 3:1 again. However, from previous pump attempts it seems that these shorts are actively protected, so will be fun to see how it goes this time...Personally, I would rate (day)trading as dangerous today. At least don't overleverage it and contribute to the liquidity in the wrong direction :)..Oh, and there's some options expiring tomorrow at $61k strike, but not too much.
17
Last chance to buy und- - oh......Last chance to sell over - -  oh my....

We already got our 2x this year..Weekly RSI has reset..Weekly BBands look like they are about to tighten up..We had a big bull hammer on the weekly a month ago..Bear volume is dropping on each push down..Maybe a few more weeks of frustration… maybe a few months… but we’re sideways and leverage is shaking out. Eventually, this pushes up to the next plateau.
25
Does anyone know of any good exchanges for someone in the United States that offers both a good API as well as paper trading?..I am getting to where I want to stop paying attention to the market again and just code my strategy into a bot. Kraken looks like they have a good API, but no paper trading on spot and I am afraid of letting loose a bot without testing it. Reminds me of a rhetorical question we had at an old job of mine, "Would you deploy your code to your own pacemaker?"

SNP500 flirting with ATH yet again (0.28% below).......And we? We are dealing with our problematic child with lots of patience and understanding. He's just built differently. :)

I watched the Big Short again yesterday and it feels like I’m in that part of the movie where nothing makes sense, the mortgages are failing and the prices aren’t falling because it is being manipulated. We are Christian Bale's character writing shitty negative numbers on the whiteboard and waiting.  There’s no reason Bitcoin should be flat-lining at the previous all time high for six months. Rate cuts are coming, money printers being turned back on to print more worthless fiat, the SP500 is doing great, AI stocks doing great. The halving is here, there’s a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF now. It seems the whales are keeping Bitcoin flat on purpose so they don’t take one single pair of weak hands on the pump.  Fuck Gox sellers, fuck every sell the news hedge fund fuck that sells into every pump.  Bitcoin will humble every single one of them and make them feel stupid for selling early in the four year cycle, just like it always does...I won't give in.  I'll wait until the end of time for my indicators to hit if I have to.  I'll write that big number on the whiteboard at the top of the cycle.
13
Present 🙋‍♂️I panic bought more, once again the bottom. I hope y’all got some more aswell, or else you are gonna cry a river just like every other time before. Enjoy.
13
Are there any good KYC-free exchanges left?
13
I’m staying in for now, I expect we’ll get a ride to the rate cut news...NVDA sold off mid day and took us along for the ride. It won’t stay down.
14
How do you all feel just days before bullrun of all times, mother of all bullruns?
20
We've been chillin within 20% of ATH for 6 months straight after a meteoric rise from SBF's goblin sex dungeon, and so many are worried it's over. Get a grip.
24
Jesus I don’t understand the negative sentiment in here. I was around in 2018 and 2019 and people were way more positive at sub 20k. Already a new ATH this year, institutional adoption, and ranging between 50-70k and you would think we are toast.
21
58k higher low established?

If so, their updated balance sheet will reveal exposure to BTC when it releases today after market close. Their most recent [balance sheet](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DELL/dell/balance-sheet?freq=Q) as of April 30th showed $10.49 billion cash on hand.
21
This is getting exhausting
15
this is weird grindy upwards price action, the kind where you take the stairs up, and sudden elevator down . don't like it.
16
Well, the price hit slightly over 61k (likely for tomorrow's option expiry) and then it's back to dumpity dump...But look at the bright side: we can *again* buy below 60k.
7
60k has been tested, re-tested and broken so many times that it is no longer the "iron clad" psychological support that it was earlier in the year ..So many good news events that should have propelled BTC during these last 6 months, but whales have chosen to continue to distribute. ..Almost everyone agrees the long-term picture of BTC is up, and the likely resolution to this death crab range is undoubedtly "upwards" towards 100k ..But what if, we actually breakdown instead? ..Does anyone have a plan B / contingency plan for this? Would this catch the majority of market participants off-sided?..Food for thought.
6
holy mother of pearl this is insane nothing holds.
10
Mid term critical we don’t hit 57k so expect 57k in like 15 mins..Edit: however if we can find support here I’ll get more bullish
7
Do not taunt happy fun Bitcoin.

On my PC, I just noticed a browser window that I forgot about, and one of the tabs said:   .  .60,360 BTCUSDT..  .I wasn't even excited, it was more of: "Oh, look who's back". Then it refreshed and reality didn't even kick in, but said 'hi'...Wasn't even phased. This is a good sign for sentiment I guess.
5
Sell it all. Today.
4
Since someone mentioned plan B, it reminded me of Plan B and the three fables..https://charts.bitbo.io/stock-to-flow/..4 cycles you can set your watch to (various metrics/charts)..Bitcoin will be used as a global currency, and G13 central banks can't stop it (spoiler alert they can disrupt the networks but more simply to disrupt physiology by market actions)..I have some btc at avg price mid 40s as a collectible and trade shitcoins as a hobby...The ideal coin for me would be an inflation adjusted cash equivalent with a price appreciation of at least  g13 blended 4week govt note  CBDC / XMR (privacy equivalent of cash) / Stablecoin / 4w bill  hybrid and is a fantasy.
3
We will only go up meaningfully when people calm down on the leverage.  It’s literally that simple.  Otherwise we will range/ dump for however long that takes 
2
Bitcoin's price action for the past six months has been so pathetic that even gold is outperforming it.
-1
Dare I say 60k has flipped support?
-2
With this drop from 65 to 58K, I think there is a fairly good chance that Bitcoin breaks 49K and gets all the way down to 42K.  From March 2024, Bitcoin's price is inside the descending channel and forming lower highs.  And this current run didn't even touch the top of the descending channel if the local top was at 65K.  Moreover, the movement from 49 to 65K (and now sub 60K) didn't even look that impulsive either as it is lagging and showing signs of exhaustion...If Bitcoin does break 49K, there isn't much support until bitcoin gets to 42K.  And if it does hit 42K, people are going go crazy with frustration.  Man, it would be brutal to peak out at 73K in March and head to 42K by end of the year.  I hope that is not what happens but even the stock market looks exhausted at the moment.  Remember, if stocks like NVIDIA undergoes large enough correction, a lot of the Bitcoin money will move towards NVIDIA.  They would much rather buy the dip on these blue chip stocks than Bitcoin.
-14
That view is what 2 prior cycles taught me. Therefore, it’s the most logical view until proven otherwise.

Where is offering 100x on 100+ coin positions?

There is, but what exactly do you want to do?..You can have 33% of value in each, and re-balance every week or so.
5
Look into the efficient frontier. It can help you find the optimal allocation mix to balance risk with return
3
I've been in since 2011 and every cycle has been my last.

I was thinking the same today. I keep reading the last cycle sentiment here, and it makes me concerned. For me, this is my second and the first one with a higher investment. If this works out now same as last cycles, I'll continue to invest.
5
I did my part yesterday hah...I expect general up today, question will be if there’s enough juice to liquidate some shorts...Pay yer money take yer chances.

If it matters set up a corp in Costa Rica...Coinbase will do what you want. Just make the paper trading up client side.

Backtest your strategy against historical data before running it live. This framework is popular:..https://github.com/mementum/backtrader
4
Gemini has a full sandbox env for their API. I haven't used their API myself though, haven't heard anything bad either. Easier than setting up your own paper trading, if you go that route...Edit: Id also be interested in what tools you're using to integrate with the exchange. I might want to do something similar.at some point.

Thank god I don't live near a beach, otherwise I'd probably take my anger out on the crabs.
11
decoupled to the upside, coupled on the downside. ..gotta love it..
10
So is gold. Yes, gold is having better price action than Bitcoin.
2
I've wanted to once we get further up from my entry point for sure. Set it and forget it...At this point I am worried that even if I set a super low stop-loss limit of like 2.4% below my entry point it will pop down there and trigger it before popping back up to who knows what...I could do a trailing buy conditional close on that, but I am scared to do that without human judgement first.
5
it's more like "no longs allowed" market
7
We ain't in a bull market ..Nothing but lower lows and lower highs for half a year... The only thing that causes people to think BTC is in a bull market is that we are "only" down about 20% from the high of 3 years ago, which is "bullish" because BTC is "usually" (twice before) down 50% from its price 3 years ago at this point in the "cycle"..Sorry for ranting I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
6
Why, what events are coming after september? Or is that just the generic cycle timeline?
8
And don't forget that "gotta get through" can be really turbulent.
6
> You have been warned...Wish this comment wasn't a bearish signal.
8
You mistyped 58k
7
> There’s no reason Bitcoin should be.....The market is the market.  Only tradfi and whales can provide the demand needed to make your NGU fantasy come to life. ..So, why are tradfi and whales not sucking supply completely dry?   They must think they have time, and/or want to have their money for other things, or be waiting to buy in cheaper.   Muse on this, nobody takes tens of millions of dollars lightly, they are huge decisions, if you do not have the urgency and the conviction of Saylor. ..I am not saying they are therefore right.  I am saying that the only entities who buy at such a volume have reasons for acting on a timeline that is ... NOT the same timeline that you have talked yourself into expecting.  ..So is it your timeline that is incorrect ... or is it everyone else who didnt buy volume that is incorrect?  You are convinced on the micro reason's you cite above, but you cannot ignore macro and expect to be right...I think it is more likely your timeline (not the whales') that needs adjustment/renegotiation. The next question would be "which of my assumptions might be off?". You have to check your premises -- nobody knows the future, but you can find probabilities. ..My own opinion is that war is looming (ukraine, israel) + big election in US + worldwide economy cooling + inflation = a layer of uncertainty.  A few of these unknowns could be resolved in the next 2-3mos, but they all could get worse OR better .... Only when uncertainty (toward good or bad) starts being less murky, will we have the answers...Man plans. God laughs...Edit: 2 typoes

Bitcoin will be bitcoin. I continue to dca

[effacé]
6
And I think it's worth noting that during that time we've weathered some bearish conditions:.  .* Summer lull while people are on holidays or just touching grass.* 50k Germany dump (were any US Gov ones that moved sold too?).* Gox distribution..Plenty of buttcoiners probably thought the Gox distro alone would end the market.
24
Yeah everyone needs to chill btc stable at 60k
5
It’s entitlement. People think because they invested in a high risk product, they should get higher returns.  Watching stocks and commodities soar whist Bitcoin ranges is fuelling frustration. ..But by definition we’ve invested in a high risk asset, so nothing is guaranteed.  Advice 101 applies… invest only what you are prepared to lose, and stay healthily diversified.  But try telling that to the leverage addicts 
8
Possible...The 49k blow out was pretty epic.
11
Does this mean the price is about to go up?

Great days back in 2014 when Dell announced they were accepting bitcoin for payment. The whole world laid in front of us. They withdrew the ability a few years later citing low interest, IIRC.
12
I’m highly skeptical this is even slightly likely, but l’d love to be wrong.
12
this is actually one of the few 'rumour' type things that might be true.
10
Nice! I think you might be right.
2
You'd rather stay at 58-59?
5
Can’t make money without volatility.
9
Why not? Constant slow grind up, and every sharp drop should be bought back up where we started, and then continue slow grind up...  .If that would happen 3 times in a row, nobody would have balls to short ever.
5
You called it
4
Breakdown is a blessing in disguise, and may be required to move higher. There is still substantial liquidity in speculative hands...I’m thinking 65k is more likely than 55k, though...Ultimately a high volume retest of the 49k blowout would help.
9
This level of resignation, fear and uncertainty is exactly what we need before the next leg up, lol. Also, PA is not the horrible if you consider we broke ATH before the halving. If you correct for that abnormality, there is still a clear trend to the upside to be found...But yeah, fuck 60/70k. This resistance level is an asshole! For over three years we try and try and it just wont stay above it.
10
The truth is somewhere in the middle, IMO. ..I think price action will be similar to 2021, we already had the  first parabolic phase with a distribution, summer dump, and then a higher high teasing 100k before rolling over...I really don't like what I see. It's a  trillion $ asset, with lots of it supply inaccessible and is lagging the stock market, hasn't beaten inflation and is toyed by the market makers and the whales just to liquidate people on either sides of the trade. .Price is trending only about 5% of the time, the rest is just chops and barts.
9
>but whales have chosen to continue to distribute...That might have been true before, but since the beginning of July, they have been accumulating again...[https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharks-whales-sub-60000-crash-data-reveals/](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharks-whales-sub-60000-crash-data-reveals/)..Also, The C&H pattern is one of the most accurate predictor (around 95% over last 2 decades for stocks). ..This price action is frustrating. I think a lot of people were expect more sooner (myself included). Historically, I think BTC is in a great spot. It is still very early in the cycle of the run-up...Who does the chart with the overlay of the previous cycles? They are always nice to see to get a different perspective.
5
Plan B is simple. Wait till bottom and buy more :)
5
For me the plan b is to put everything in cold wallet and forget about it for the next 5 years.
2
The idea of 100k as a realistic target seems laughable given how hard it is to durably break 70k... And now 60k appears to be the new 70k.
6
Plan B might end up being plan a. The asset bubble that has grown like the monster that bled acid in the movie Alien is going to set off an epic stock market meltdown. BTC will likely go right along with it. Sometime in 2025. Liquidity is going to dry up. I could see BTC heading to 25K.
-2
Bots started dumping in lockstep with NVDA.

I dont think it breaks out of this half-year long range unless it retests the 49k low with a bullish divergence or a massive capitulation with a dip in the 30s.

I use my last phone as an alarm clock and rarely connect to wifi...sometimes I go a full year without connecting. There are times when I look at the Bitcoin Checker pull-down and it is 20-30k off, depending on where we are in a cycle.

RemindMe! 6 months

I wanted to but missed the chance, thinking it would go higher before dumping.

You dare'nt

This truly is a different ballgame now. It has always been volatile, but the reasons for PA are just so much more nuanced and/or obscure now. This is coming from an old miner/mtgoxer who got a sour taste in the mouth from the MtGox ordeal and left the game for the past ten years...Like, what could possibly be causing this? I don't see how it can be a cascade effect, at least not the start of it...Edit: Granted, I got a low entry at 58.6, so I don't care much, but it's just so odd...
7
I dare you :-)

You were bearish during the price run up from 40k to 70k, flipped bullish near the top, now you’re calling for 42k. Never have I felt better about being spot long.
29
!bb predict <42001 Dec 31 u/simmol

Why stop there. If it goes to 42, it will probably go to 30. Once 30 is triggered what's stopping it from going to 18. Before we know it we'll be able to scoop up a large chunk sub dollar.

"I mean, you gotta sit there, right?  In the car, and it always takes a while to get uptown, right?  So whatcha gotta DOOO, is ... you just log in .... and ... you gotta wreck any longs you can FIND.  Because it's the right thing to DOO.  You see what I'm saying?"

Getting drunk and throwing 100x leverage at the 10s chart is better than Vegas.

Yeah. Good point about just tracking it client-side. Also good point about setting up a corp somewhere.

I'm with United on this one, while your post can be seen as "whiny" or "indicative of capitulation/ neg sentiment needed for us to rally for real & leave you behind, etc , etc" I see plenty more posts here filled with hopium and copium..If anyone wants to see what a true bottom / despair / reversal signal looks like, go back to Mar. 2020 or even middle of 2022.
3
We are up 40% since January. We are outperforming the SPX by a factor of 2.
2
We need another lower low for that.
2
Agree. We were in a bull market in February, and we may be again in November (questionable at this point), but we are not right now.

The “seasonals” are better in Oct through Dec, especially during halving years:..https://x.com/cryptojellenl/status/1828781078901084668?s=46&t=g54eEZidr6eQGEiAwOizKQ

FTX payouts in cash (a few billions; some of it will flow back into BTC) and further rate cuts. All of it will bring additional capital to the market...Edit on FTX: judge's approval is needed first. It's around 11 billion (!).

High time preference is the shit, isn’t it?

Yea, I hold since 2019. Was gonna dump my bags at 2021 when price was 60k but got brainwashed by planB 100k prediction. Fk that guy
-3
Okay, grandpa :)
5
This is the way.
5
Or we’re just gonna see normies herpderping around with CBDCs, because “they are too late to buy Bitcoin anyway”.
6
It's been the biggest \*known\* black cloud over the BTC market other than Satoshi's stash, and the market is absorbing it like a fucking champ at prices that were the tippity-top of the last cycle. It's bullish, idk how else to interpret it.
12
As for the Gox distro, can't speak for others obviously, but there were quite a few polls on r/mtgoxinsolvency that showed most of us were planning on holding, err.. hodlin' sorry. As much as you can trust internet polls (which is not at all), it probably at least showed the sentiment...As for myself, I had a super bad taste in my mouth at first (when gox went down)... and some part of me still morns the coins that were stolen from me, but at the same time we got to see what the forced hold of the few bits of coins we got tossed back did. I've only ever spent $300 on btc as a poor college kid that saw a very cool technology... and here I am...From what I've seen the goxxers get a lot of hate across the board, but the major dip related to that was just from fear and before the distros even went out.
8
Diversification doesn’t make wealth. ..Have a winner? Go all in.
12
low time preference behavior. people want it up *now* and not later.
4
Yeah I mean I expect high returns too but I’m also not planning on selling for 10 years maybe longer barring something unforeseen. I’m probably over invested but I firmly believe this will be the best performing asset of the next 10 years. Patience truly is a virtue.
2
It can't predict the future...Being that this indicator draws beardivs on `high` and bulldivs on `low` it can help visualise the shape of the channel. Like bollinger bands show standard deviations from mean, but not getting blown out by volatility in one direction or another...I'd probably read it as *"That was extrem, this here is more like the real bottom of the channel for now, confirmation of trend. Until something changes."*..So we meander up within the noise, or we go up more quickly, or this gets invalidated by going below 49.1k and we leave this range for lower, the entire setup becoming bearish instead, a failure of momentum.

Im buying more!

I would have a lot more BTC if Dell and Newegg hadn't.

And he's a lot saner than Musk
5
That would be alright if we could actually grind up to where we started

the more I think about revisiting 49 the more I think it will surely happen given that it seems to me each and every low has never happened only once, at least with some similar wick

Needs an ancient historic reference, and a list that's longer than it needed to be to get the point across:.. - "I'm stuck in the back of an Uber for 30 minutes, what am I gonna do?  listen to spotify? doom-scroll on instagram? watch the world go by? watch a 3 hour youtube video of myself? *snort-smirks*, read The Story of Civilization Volume II and get motion sickness? have an awkward conversation with the driver about how he's stuck in fiat-hell?  If you go back and study history, you'll realise that when Caesar was in his chariot, he wasn't wasting time with distractions, he was doing what was important. So I do the same. I could buy spot and hodl, but for this scenario, for my 30 minute timeframe, 100x leverage is the best. What's the second best use of time in an Uber? There is no second best! *ok*" *snort-smirks*
2
On crypto forums/subreddits (including here) the consensus seems to be that we are just "where we need to be at this point in 4 year cycle." So basically "everyone" is still off a ton of hopium...If/when that rally doesn't materialize, I fear a true capitulation... This mythical post halving rally is the last narrative left (short term at least) to drive hype... And at a certain point, lackluster performance will cause people to question why they are so far out on the risk curve - not trying to spread doom and gloom, but if we breakdown next year and BTC is in the 20-40k range, it could be a "nail in the coffin" so to speak, as "the fastest horse in the race" will have been completely left behind...Need to see btC rally meaningfully over the next 12-18 months to justify my bullishness. Remember when BTC used to "10x every 4 years"?  That is obviously not a sustainable trend, but there's a real chance that we see negative returns over a 4 yr period next yr (2021->2025)... Not sure what the point of my post is, but offering a countering perspective to the 320k by EOY nonsense I read about here... People really think we're going to 6x in 4 months when we can't even stay above 60k....Even 80k seems far off now with every 1% pump being immediately sold off. Demand needs to make a comeback for a rally, halvings on their own don't tell you shit about price action - otherwise Litecoin would be in the 4 figures by now. But the demand isn't there for shitcoins... Hopefully for BTC it picks up though
5
Right about the time Saylor started loading up.
1
Risk-adjusted return is a better metric than net return when gauging bullishness/bearishness...Bitcoin's YTD return is 40% but max drawdown is -34%...SPX's YTD return is 18.8% but max drawdown is -9.5%...bitcoin's ret/max_dd = 40/34 = 1.176470588..SPX's ret/max_dd = 18.8/9.5 = 1.978947368..Btc's return is 2.1x greater than that of SPX but its max_dd is 3.5x greater than that of SPX...This means that if you scale SPX's max drawdown to match Bitcoin’s, SPX would've made 67% YTD as opposed to bitcoin's 40%. ..Suddenly SPX has been outperforming bitcoin by a factor of 1.67. Now which has been more bullish this year, bitcoin or spx?
10
Wdym? We had a bunch of lower lows already
1
“AI, quantum, and the Grusch stuff [UAPs] are three sides of one triangle.”..That'll be the "hype triangle" of media over-reaction ;-)
3
Fk you. Take responsibility for yourself
9
This is their plan: force everyone into cash and CBDCs with these unrealized gains taxes.
2
yeah, and I've seen barely a mention of it anywhere to be honest.
5
The funny thing is, for some (a lot?) people the gox hack will end up being a net gain, as the benefit of the forced hodl will out-weigh what they lost.
9
> polls on r/mtgoxinsolvency..Selection bias.
4
Sorry that happened to you. It super sucks. I don't mean any offense by this, but that was still very early days, and it should have been relatively easy to stack plenty of coin in the $200-5k range, years actually. Hope you were able to.
3
>Diversification doesn’t make wealth. ..Ackshually yes it does, it just takes 30+ years to compound. "Having a winner" boils down to being lucky or very very smart, and I would bet the vast majority of the posters in this sub aren't either of those (you and me included lol).
2
please stop, you're making it worse, we'll be at 58k at this rate
9
Yeih. Baaaaaack in my daaaaaay. We didn't have none this new-fangled fancy-schmancy leveraged options and what-doofangled contraptions y'all seem to be talking about...Yah could mine yahself a few coins and go try to spend 5 to buy a $1.25 Coke. 'Cept ain't nobody heard of that kinda money.
4
Then just send your coins to most shady exchange, wait for it to "get hacked" and wait 10 years for settlement, like we all did with MtGox...  .Made 200X on that trade.
8
😄 this is perfect...I love that guy.
1
Im with you' 100% on this United. Wouldn't be surprised if we were someplace in the "complacency" stage of a mini 2021 mid-cycle top like in may 2021 and we have a big puke coming. Or maybe somewhere in 2019 after the initial summer peak was hit and we just kind of slow bled our way back down before the next rise. ..The soonest you question the veracity of this "bull run", the echo chamber will call you a whiner, a bear, "going to get left behind" or inpatient ..Anything to justify the pathetic PA. ..When even boomer stocks like Walmart and Costco are outperforming, you really need to question the thesis. ..If BTC is really going to 100k from here, there will be plenty of time to hop back on the ride if things turn around from here
1
Exactly this! No big money can be attracted if the risk adjusted returns are not at least double than the SPX at this stage of BTC life cycle.
7
Yeah, I'm hoping that's all it is. Pines is a pretty serious guy though, so...
2
Fk u plan B
-5
Ah yes, unrealized gain tax where you have to sell your asset to pay the tax and then sell more to pay the tax on your tax
9
Everything turns into a non event… then bitcoin goes up.
3
Yeah, I mean, who knows what I would have done in those ten years. I had a plan to just let it sit until "fuck you" money level... but then there is that motorcycle I wanted, or that bill that came up, or that job I lost, right?..I for one am glad to be back. I never stopped believing in the tech and idea behind it. I did just fine without it, now I have a nice windfall and can get back into some swing trading and DCA (now with far more knowledge of how markets work to boot).
2
If they got 15% of the coins back, they only need a 7x to make a profit in dollar terms
1
No offense taken. I actually did myself a disservice by not doing that. I had such a bad taste in my mouth from that I stepped away from Crypto altogether. Hindsight is 20/20, right?..All in all, it is water under the bridge. I am not very materialistic and have everything I want. Easy come, easy go...Also, with the Gox payout I still got a nice little windfall even only getting the small percentage back I did...You know what makes it even more ironic? I had gotten tired of watching the market myself and had written a bot to trade for me that was doing fairly well. It got caught in the middle of trading with most in fiat when Gox started denying orders. I knew that something was up with Gox when I started getting emails about the bot's trades failing while I was on a bus on my way into work. When I got there I contacted Gox and got the "we're having technical difficulties" line...I have calculated what was stolen in today's value... but I try not to think about that. Also, like I said below, who knows if I would have had the gumption to keep holding as life threw curveballs, ya know?
8
Futures nicely amplify everything: gains, losses and risk. Some people want it "extra spicy" I guess. And market movers laugh all the way to the bank.
3
It’s beautiful, isnt it?
1
yeah but I don't just mean an overall profit, I mean they're better off getting 15% in 2024 than getting all their coins back in 2014, because they would have sold them too early.
2
I can only imagine what holding 50+ coins would have been like through all those ups and downs over the last 10 years. Diamond hand OG's who held up to this point deserve the wealth they have honestly. ..Seems like you got your head on straight. I'd bet you're doing just fine. Cheers

people who care about NVDA earnings and have large enough money to move the markets are predominantly trading during stock hours. we'll know more once international markets open and especially close of U.S. markets tomorrow...for anyone who missed it:..> NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 28, 2024, of $30.0 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and up 122% from a year ago...> For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.67, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 168% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.68, up 11% from the previous quarter and up 152% from a year ago...https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2025..tl;dr: beat estimations by about 4%...in my opinion, the Outlook section of their report is interesting because it seems to indicate an expected slowing in revenue growth. although their "plus or minus 2%" (or $650,000,000) carries a lot of weight...also in my opinion, fuck worrying about stocks yet here i am...anyone with other thoughts on what the specifics of the report might mean for bitcoin and risk-on assets?

Now we even care about Nvidia?..Guys, we stopped mining Bitcoin with Nvidia GPUs way back in 2014, all good!

Are BTC options the last puzzle piece holding back some institutional investors that need a cost-efficient hedge? It's a day old but [Nasdaq seeks SEC approval for bitcoin index options (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nasdaq-seeks-sec-approval-bitcoin-index-options-2024-08-27/) - pretty good article explaining a lot of it. There seems to have been some ping-pong between the parties already so chances should be improving...----..Another puzzle piece for the US seems to be a clear and somewhat fair national (tax) regulation. Ex. there are relevant countries where you only need to report YE balances taxed at a low property rate, similar to cash. This asset class, in the US is not yet worth the risk and competitive enough by international *standards* [Edit: or *by comparison* - sorry, non-native speaker here] - and maybe all of that matters to some institutions (=more latent demand)...Have a great day and an even greater night, it's already Wednesday. In case you forgot, that's 2/3 of the avg. work week. Good r/r on making it to the weekend in a civilized way?

Interesting post (with chart) on X by Giovanni Santostassi last night. His POV is that the bull run will begin when liquidity catches up to price. Liquidity is rising. Counterintuitively, the price dropping a bit lower will make this “cross” happen sooner, and will trigger the bull run...Food for thought...https://x.com/giovann35084111/status/1828648455168020677?s=46

Is it August 13th yet?
18
in a bull market, red days are for buying. i'm fully back in now with my trading stack and it feels good. at 74k, i never thought i'd be able to buy more bitcoin at 57k. maybe we go down more but that'd just be me being extra greedy. i'm fine losing out on a 10% drop if it means i don't miss 50% gains.
19
Bitcoin is a tradfi altcoin right now. Lags when tradfi pumps. Falls twice as hard when tradfi dumps. You hate to see it
10
With tradfi down and NVIDIA going down after earnings, Bitcoin's sudden drop yesterday makes more sense.  Wall Street in general is wary about market taking a correction and they probably dumped crypto initially before selling of their tech stocks as well.  Someone below mentioned it very well and I think it has been apt ever since Wall Street money begin piling in starting 2020:  Bitcoin is like tradfi alt coin these days.  It is a very good alt coin but nonetheless, when shit hits the fan, it is the first to get unloaded.
20
Still bearish and holding shorts but think we could get an [8% up move](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UDutEHf1/) before dropping further, 2% up move in equities, just seems to lineup across the board with [DXY going to 99.77](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IO9LRjMe/) to break the previous low and get everyone giddy then come raging back.  So I'm going for BTC back up to 63,856 ish and then lights out, short term play might not work...Edit: best long entry is 57,153 ish if it can get there, 57,953 might hold as the bottom, best entry would be lower but it could hold here at 57,953, you could go wider stop with less degeneracy lol. I think equities can hold here so 57953 could work.
15
so nvidia beats earnings, its stock goes down, bitcoin follows. got it.
14
Leverages building up rapidly in the 58 - 58.7K range.  These degenerates are the worst.
15
Looking at the 4 hour chart, Bitcoin's price action is inside an ascending channel (connecting the highs and the lows from August 8th and onward).  Right now, it is hugging at the bottom of the channel and if it breaks downward, there is a decent chance that Bitcoin takes out the prior low of 49K.  That should put fear into most of the newbie ETF holders as most of them will be in red if it dumps below 49K (which was the price when Bitcoin ETF started trading)...If it dumps, then there is a lot of volume at 42K range and this would be where a new descending trend line would form connecting the prior lows from the 1 day chart.  And if things go bad, I think Bitcoin could then range in a channel between 42K and 53K for a while.  ..Of course, this is one of the worst case scenarios for the year.
17
Looks like a few bots decided to have a friendly little tussle around 59.7k.

The most disappointing part is the way Bitcoin hasn’t shown much strength while stocks have pumped and DXY has taken a decent hit. ..If stocks sell off, or DXY bounces it’s a tough ask for Bitcoin to hold strong 
9
Moar gap? This is fine.
5
A nice series of lower highs, sigh. Not expecting big upward moves until maybe October or around election time. One thing about these lower highs is we don't have to go as far up to get a higher high anymore... I could see us ranging back up again starting in the next few weeks, but it's tough out here in the crab zone.

I didn't see anyone post this news which may well explain yesterday's price drop...> Mining Firm Rhodium Enterprises Files for Bankruptcy..> Rhodium Enterprises, a Bitcoin mining company, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas, citing debts of $50-100 million. ... https://x.com/LukasShmutz/status/1828481043193585736

a word for bulls comrades - uncertainty where does it stop or where it's really going to bottom... yes! first accept it. take it in with every breath, let the pain flow through you, make peace with it. then, trigger some buys just below your favorite MA. it helps. at least for a moment

Pretty much faded 100% of the Powell speech gains last week.....So what's the next bit of hopium Boyz?..NVDA blowout earnings today to pump us back to low [60.xxx](http://60.xxx) which may inevitably get faded again?

Im not impressed with bitcoin nor stonks…

Bunch of people crabby about the crab. We will be much higher next year I expect. Solid chance we'll be 10% higher within the next 3 months (very possibly much sooner). Easy to accumulate here IMO. 6 months of sideways trading is how you build a solid support level. Relax.

I can't scream this enough and it never seems to stick with people but the market never depends on news or events. It's all supply and demand and the big boys already have their positions, they're not getting thrown around by events like retail.  The big task is to figure out that puzzle.

> As part of this transaction, OBTC unitholders will receive shares of BITB as part of a liquidating distribution of OBTC. For existing BITB holders, there will be no changes to their shares or any changes to the operation of BITB. ...the Asset Purchase Agreement is intended to be tax-free for OBTC unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes...BITB has 37k bitcoin ($2.3B in AUM). OBTC has $121M in AUM, which would be about 2k bitcoin. looks like that wouldn't shuffle the BTC ETF holders around, with top 5 in order still being IBIT, GBTC, FBTC, ARKB, and BITB...OBTC holders were previously paying 0.49% management fee and BITB is 0.20% so probably works out better for them...10% of BITB profits are donated to bitcoin open-source development and i think it's good for the ecosystem to continue to see them grow.

Glad to hear this from you. I’m almost fully back in, just missing about 2% (the ladder thing causing that) yet am fine with my current position.

Is it really that bad? I don't think we would see this price so early without the ETF. I do believe the four-year cycle will continue, leaving tradfi in the dust after the consolidation phase.

Crypto seems to have a tendency to front-run a lot of similar price action in TradFi markets. Doesn't always line up, but it happens often enough

NVDA had a blowout ER last quarter and it didn't do anything for BTC or, inspire the risk-on rally that I had expected. Given BTC behavior since March, at best the earnings are neutral, at worst bearish for BTC. Even if NVDA has a strong performance, it won't influence BTC, and if NVDA misses you can bet your ass BTC is crashing along with other risk assets.
4
I'm betting on another lower low next, likely a bump up right before next Fed meeting, but then of course a sell off after.

Everything is risk off right now..

10% up in 3 months doesn't feel great when we're down 10% in 24 hours. But yes I agree. Crab sideways, it's noise at the end of the day.

good thought. i'd say AI is the home PC. people saying "nobody needs this" and, at the time, most were only using it as a fancy fax machine. now we know that it does *everything* better. feels like AI is in the same boat..let's say early 90s computer equivalent? we don't even know how to use it yet. imagine asking the most creative thing to ever exist "create me a picture of a butthole falling out of a pencil lol"..once we know how to use it as a tool to increase and replace productivity, i think we see interesting things. maybe we're approaching the flat part of an S-curve though...flat, relatively speaking? in my opinion, once we learn to throw AI into dedicated, portable hardware we'll really be cooking – either apocalyptically or towards grim utopia. less iRobot and more R2-D2 or robotic arms (like those used to build cars)...so how that impacts us now or for the next year? risk off behavior, as you mentioned isn't good for risk-on assets like bitcoin. i don't think we're quite into risk-off territory yet, though. we'll know more in about a month :)

I’m not sure the August 5th low would have cascaded down that far were it not for the extra pressure from the carry-trade unwind though.  Arguably, we might even have printed a higher low versus the July one were it not for that.  Pure guesswork here, but I don’t see sub-50K happening again until the near true bear market (which I think will be especially brutal).

I am rather new to more serious trading, so I can't speak on that as much, but I can speak on the AI part as it relates to NVDA (trying to remain unbiased since I am a fanboy because gamer that has only had NVDA cards..)...The main thing to consider with NVDA I think is that:  .A) You hit the nail on the head with the AI description. It can do WAY more than what most people realize in WAY more applications than just the chat bot most people currently use it for. I am talking outside of even LLMs here. The main thing behind the scenes is us more fully realizing the power of artificial neural networks and how they very much work like the real thing. I recently read a study where they isolated the neural network of a rat's brain responsible for mus... I am going on a tangent.. you get the point.  .B) Most people don't realize the main thing driving NVDA is not necessarily the Blackwell architecture, but CUDA. The main two libraries we have for making and training AI models are TensorFlow and PyTorch. They don't run the actual training. They pass it off to CUDA, which runs at a very near-hardware low-level and is responsible for shoving the inputs through the GPU in a parallel way. TF and PyTorch are both optimized for CUDA and while there are some attempts at getting around that, well... a good comparison I have used is Microsoft having exclusive access to DirectX back in the day. Because of this, nearly every PC game was made to run on Windows. Did we have OpenGL? Sure... but DirectX took the cake and thus we see what happened. In that same way, NVDA has the AI sector by the balls a bit. Not that I have an issue with this necessarily (see fanboi comment above)...  .Anyways, hope that perspective helps.

agreed, i hope it continues. each year it feels like we're losing our roots more and more
1
In trying to time bottoms for years now, I’ve bought the left side of the bounce, yet near the reversal, over 90% of the time. I tried remedying that for almost an entire year, but my tracking showed that I made less profits while trying to nail the bottom or buy the right side of the reversal. If it works best, I best be doing it. Trying to nail the bottom was more an ego thing for me anyway.
2
I mean you can see on the chart that it dipped simultaneously with Bitcoin and other assets.
3
And this is second time in a row it happened after market close. Last time it was upswing tho (63600 > 65000).
3
Funding dropped from 0.0030 >> 0.0021..Still got some juice in it. And it needs to get negative for reversal, if we continue same pattern that is.

I was thinking they'd have to liquidate any of their coins to pay the debt? Not sure how many they have, maybe none. But max 100MM. If that's not what OP was talking about then how do you explain the price drop being related? It's the only way I could see them being related is that SOMEONE had to sell coins to cover the debt???..Maybe it's not related at all.. which is what my comment said. I am basically agreeing that it doesn't make sense.

it's far from it. the amount of value generated even out of simple data parsing is sheer insanity. there are companies out there literally printing money, while being just more or less sophisticated wrappers doing API calls to commercially available LLM models...the pace of adaption is nothing I've seen yet, and I've been in tech for 20+ years. I still can't make an wire transfer with instant settlement across the border, but banks adopted AI AML/KYC within just months...tl;dr the amount of mundane back-office work that is being automated by enterprises is mind boggling.

same exact scenario for me. if i get too conservative with buying back in, i get *too conservative* and ultimately miss a good portion of the move back up...at this point, with the history of how bitcoin moves and my own trading habits, i know i'd rather step away from the charts for a while if there's a drop rather than seeing it jump 30% in a week and leaving me sitting on the sidelines.

As someone else already mentioned, during low(er) liquidity periods it's easier to cause price swings.

T+17: Funding 0.0021 >> 0.0011. Until it starts getting into double-digit negative, I do not expect reversal.
3
i can't do math, please show me...it's also a very nice picture, i thank you for noticing. it shows bitcoin's peaks and troughs quite clearly...further, i'd be curious to hear how the value of the global reserve asset *wouldn't* be correlated in some way with the price of all other assets, bitcoin included. if it's not correlated in any way then what are we doing supporting an asset that is supposed to protect us from the debasement of the asset that we claim to not have any correlation? in your words, what is the point of all of this?
2
Fair enough, my read is that if they had 100MM bitcoin to sell they wouldn't be filing chapter 11 or defaulting on their loans...Like you, I don't see current PA related much, if at all.

I'd say the assets are the miners themselves and they're already rekt on Bitcoin reserves, because they were stupid enough to hold reserves in the asset they mine instead of the currency they pay bills in.

Could have been more elaborative in my comment but I don’t have much time while at work. I’ll try to be more specific. ..What I’m mostly saying in my original comment is that when an entire market rests on the prospects of one stock, it’s not healthy. It can be a sign of exhaustion from the market, warranting a longer pause in growth. ..All the while, you have population growth declining, and that won’t be fixed unless there’s a redistribution of wealth and resources. Or unless there’s a fundamental shift in how our economy operates. ..What’s NGU growth though? Don’t know the acronym, sorry. Should have been more specific, regardless. Tech growth can keep advancing across many industries, you’re right. And such tech can be truly beneficial to humanity. AI advancement is a double-edged sword, though, as we know. ..AI if implemented well can save us from human error and improve accuracies and efficiencies. If gone too far, we can only imagine the consequences. ..Current AI is just souped up computing that wastes a huge amount of energy to make an image or text amalgamation. The primary entities who benefit from this are those who can exploit it for profit, either by replacing human workers or by creating content with minimal effort that will be consumed by the masses. ...-Victor Cobra

I don't necessarily think he is LARPing, but he does seem rather eccentric. I generally enjoy the guy's posts, and he's been killin' it trading the last year or so. The AI doomsday narrative is exhausting though and especially ironic since he appears to be building part of the apparatus

My take was tongue-in-cheek. But see, if you expect that small things won't matter anymore after the AGI "revolution", I suspect you're in for a rude surprise. For better or worse, indeed...The question then becomes: when is a tool not a tool.

Multiply that by a few billion and the small things start to matter quite a lot. Unless of course you expect that some kind of "revolution" will happen and most people will either die out in the aftermath, or be rendered irrelevant. In which case, why are we trying to make an AGI to begin with?

Oh, don't get me wrong, I am not saying it will all be roses and sunshine.

Before that is vast economic and conflict changes that will move faster than society can I suspect. We are gonna have to get through that as well. Again, for better or worse.... and look at that... we are in the $58k's again. Huh.

Working in the middle of it could mean "any ol IT job inside a financial services corporation" ... the teams inside are working on technology that will make many (many) salaries redundant. ..It makes me wonder how (and if) I'll get my mortgage paid*, 10 years from now, and that's saying nothing of those who don't already have relevant/adjacent utility, to a company who aspires to implement such things...*(hedging with some btc may help that... but won't help the neighbors)

Serious 100%.   Clean exit no problemo. In fact, now I see that using toilet paper is disgusting
2
You don’t get it. The analog is privately controlled thermonuclear weapons. The capital being deployed is not imaginable in pursuit of this goal.

Still no reversal IMO, but we will see.
3
So all LLM must be trained on pre-2020 data going forward?..The only thing which really impresses me about the current LLM trend is that RL was involved...Using RL to tweak such a model was a pretty interesting development. Always been an RL fan.

Yes, exactly the same format as the last 300 years or so, except made worse because people will have a harder time developing critical thinking skills. Everything can be completed for them, including their own thinking. This goes for people of all socioeconomic classes. It’s worse than “late stage capitalism” and more dystopian. Though I suppose the two are often intertwined. Regulations can help us avoid this. Good policies and good parenting. ..-Victor Cobra

Thanks for the clarification, I think we're mostly in agreement here after all...If things really do go south (yeah, we're human after all so...), the next sandwich might indeed become an issue. Space age tech, but society barely beyond caveman epoch. Le sigh...(disclaimer: I want to see an AGI become a reality too, but someone has to play the devil's advocate)
2
Thanks, it's the frustration of people in this sub and others saying they "work in the middle of AI", no way to verify it, nor do they say anything insightful of substance, and they basically say "hide yo kidz hide yo wife" and you say "why, what do you know?", and they go radio silent. ..I've listened to the full on fear mongers like Eliezer Yudkowsky, and the other side where it's all peaches and roses, but I'm all ears from people who claim to know shit. I like hearing their perspective. IDK why it's gotta be secret or ultra vague...I'm at the point where it's like stfu if you have nothing to say then.
4
as opposed to what exactly?
1
Sure I do, I just disagree with you about certain things, if you don't mind. Again if, as you posit, anything we do, want or expect is irrelevant (the "small things"), why should we make an AGI at all...I do agree that the genie is out of the bottle already, but what you seem to say is that we have no control over what is going to happen anymore (please correct me if I'm wrong). And this is a dangerous viewpoint precisely because the loss of control (even perceived) makes people do bad things.
1
T+45: Funding 0.0008 > 0.0000..I think we've got juice for one more push up, and then reversal. I placed my limits in 60-61k range.
3
I think we share a "common dread" ..This is our generation's flavor.  There is a new variety every epoch/era/generation. Every time humanity up adapting and morphing to confront the new reality. ..> It’s worse than “late stage capitalism” and more dystopian. Though I suppose the two are often intertwined. Regulations can help us avoid this. Good policies and good parenting. ..Good parenting is a great start... perhaps we need to look at what has changed parenting.  I'd argue inflation did that -- we now need 2 incomes to support the lifestyle that 1 income used to support.  Why?  Inflation. .."more policies, more regulations" = more unintended consequences, which are shaped by those who tend to be least worthy of trust (although I DO agree with you politically/philosophically).  Putting the expectations in the "outsourced to government" basket is the same logic that got us exactly to where we are right now. ..It's a fine balance, and impossible to get right. Nevermind that it is shifting quickly, on top of that.   Humanity may be wanting some help, but humanity has no rudder, and never has.  Yes somehow humanity survived.  I'm not saying we should invite more unknowns/variables, but no matter whether we are inviting them, we'll get them, and we must face the future.  Trying to stop it is moot.  And it's folly.
2
I think that's valid, but I also don't expect much in this sub, in that regard.  Even working in IT, with the people who are clearly working on pathways for adoption/integration of AI ... I feel like I'm on the outside of things.  All we can do is try to learn, and prepare for unknown, unnamed, unanticipated change.  ..and hedge with a little survivalism.    and keep stacking sats.
1
What do you mean ? Your bathroom hygiene will change by eating mostly plants
2
You don’t matter. I don’t matter...Why isn’t AI being talked about in the US election?
1
T+59: Funding 0 > -0.0007%..10ish more points down, and we go for next leg up.
3
Fair enough. Godspeed
2
good luck with your plant shit
0
And here we disagree again. You *do* work in the AI sector, so by definition you have more "say" over things, even if by a little...Are you seriously saying that the developments are beyond anyone's control already? I highly doubt that.
3
Order book surely plays important role for this, but I am not sure what, and how?..Hmmm.... Ideas?
3
He's saying that AI is too "good for business" so no politician is going to stand in its way. Even if it kills us all.
2
T+1:35: Hmmm, I expected this to resolve one war or the other much sooner. However, traders are probably a bit exhausted, so it is hard to scoop up enough short positions for action to be profitable...  .Anyways, if we fall below 59400, I will consider my idea to be faulty...On the other hand, if wee make it over last high (60200) I will consider it at least partially correct.
3
T+1:47: Funny, As soon as I wrote last diary entry, we climbed from 59.7k to 60k. Funding increased from .0017 to .0020..I am not sure if that is enough to make this profitable, but let's see...Basic idea is: While the price is going up, as long as funding gets increasingly negative, it is profitable to pump more.
2
T+2:17: Dear diary, I haven't slept in days
5
> While the price is going up, as long as funding gets increasingly negative, it is profitable to pump more..Can you elaborate more. Why do you expect this to happen?
3
T+3:18: Funding rate is dwindling... I guess abort mission. Funding premium wasn't high enough to be profitable to trigger a movement...Oh well, better luck next time. I need more samples of this specific action anyways.
2
Can't explain now. I need this to resolve first to analyze the data.
2
So, if funding is negative, that means shorts pay longs, right?..Which means there are more short positions open, and increasingly more...And if you are *someone* who can move the markets, and you see that with each step up more and more shorts open (People are not selling their BTC, they are just gambling that "the top is in", as they must close their position sooner or later).  .  .That gives you incentive to continue pushing the price up, because in the end, all those outstanding shorts will have to buy at the top. Otherwise you let them make money on their shorts (AKA take money from you)...  .On the other hand, when you see longs increasing, that's when you start selling, as you triggered their FOMO, and same as shorts, they will need to sell sooner or later, and you want to be first to sell...Or at least this is how I understand it. I'd love to hear a market-moving whale chip in tho.
1
I enjoyed that, cheers!
2
Nice to hear it wasn't all in vain. :)..Also, I almost perfectly called local top. If it ain't going up, it must come down, right?..Too bad I didn't realize it to open a short, I just closed my long, and called it a day...

Not losing money is a win in this market!

Mmmm. Volume.

Liquidations shall continue till morale improves.
11
For the last couple of weeks or so, funding has been pretty much negative and it propelled, a slow ascent in the Bitcoin's price.  With Bitcoin going up, FOMO was in the air and in the past 2 days, funding crept back up.  Now, we see liquidation.  About 100 million dollars worth of longs liquidated in the last hour...While Bitcoin was ranging from 50-70K since March, I suspect that at least 10-20 billion dollars worth of longs were liquidated during that time.  Why make the effort to raise the price when there is all this dumb money ready to be exploited?..Imagine where Bitcoin would be if all these liquidated longs (tens of billions in the last 6 months) bought spot instead?
20
Even if 58.0K is the local low, Bitcoin will double bottom near the local low before moving up.  It likes to fuck with people and make them lose hope.

OKAY! We get it! Jfc

Today's comments are a bit spazzy, expectedly, but on this huge day just wanted to say thanks for being the last place on reddit to have a decent conversation about Bitcoin. Don't post much as I just hold, but have been here for quite a few years (before this account as well), r/Bitcoin went to shit during the fork wars, but this forum has held strong. Congrats to all.

https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/fg-89shlq.pdf..APPROVED..After 10 years, I see it. And I can’t believe it. I have read each and every withdrawal and rejection since a decade. Unreal.

You know, a part of me never really thought this day would happen.  When the Winklevii submitted back a decade ago, I was stoked.  As the years went on and SEC approval never materialized, however, I became numbed to the whole thing...Today, though...  I know we joke about it and stuff, but I honestly think that today: this is gentlemen...Cheers, all. Happy New Year and here's hoping that this is truly the start of the next chapter in Bitcoin's future.
24
[effacé]

Anyways...Tick tock next block...Onto the halving.
28
I believe the tweet to be irrelevant and we will see approval today as expected. There may not even be a vote, it may just happen by default. The halving is getting nearer every day too, price action will be crazy in the coming year.
21
There is another point in yesterdays SEC fake tweet that was dubious: it did not mention _which_ ETFs were approved. I would expect a complete and explicit list of the approved ETFs.
20
this shitshow has been absolute bonkers and i love it. whatever happens today, know that excitement and fun has been had.

21
From the live stream:..Catie Woods says she doesn't believe the hack will delay the ETFs, "but you never know". Later, "we can't say what we are doing [with our position], especially when the Bitcoin ETF is not yet approved"...No no official approval yet.
20
BlackRock and Fidelity are both behemoths with trillions in AUM. Both are setting their spot ETF fee at 0.25% and both will do extraordinarily well because of how much existing influence they have in TradFi...But I think one of the biggest winners in the spot ETF race ends up being Bitwise with the lowest fee at 0.2% and the best marketing campaign so far...“You know what’s interesting these days? Bitcoin. Look for Bitwise, my friends.”
22
Not sure what to think about the tweets of this Fox guy, but anyway:..> One senior exec at a major $BTC spot ETF applicant tells @FoxBusiness that the @SECGov  had informed his firm that the fund will be approved today sometime after the close of trading.

(As said earlier - normally - we see it after 19b-4 approval, like Nasdaq did.)..edit: Nasdaq also filed for Valkyrie and NYSE requested it for [Grayscale](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588489/000114336224000014/GBTC011024.pdf) too. Obv expecting just all of them now.
22
It makes sense that we see alts up and BTC down. Really the WHOLE crypto market is up. But BTC is currently saddled with people that bought just to sell on ETF approval. Once the ETF inflows start, Bitcoin will catch up.
23
My god, they really did it, they managed to price it in.

Update: ..Lmao vanguard, after having banned gbtc for a while due to it being a degen asset (you could hold it and sell it, as I’ve held it there for some time, but they banned buying more of it) has officially relisted it for trading. ..Love to see it

My feeeling is that the market has weathered the “sell the news” fears and is now gaining confidence for a push up leading into tomorrow...There is little to suggest tomorrow will be a down day considering ETFs are only buying at this stage...To me that’s enough to create a bit of an overnight surge...Just my 2c on the current trading environment...Also, ETFs are finally here!

I’ve been riding the corn since 2013 and literally the whole fucking 10 years there’s been endless chat about an ETF. A full decade of rumours, listings, and denials... .The SEC could of approved Winklevii ETF in 2014 and the world at large would not have given a shit..They could of even just approved Greyscale and the hype would have been intermediate at most...But no......as if he was Skrillex DJ’ing at 2am at Cochella, whipping the hype and frenzy to absolute astronomically frothy heights, Gary Gensler has lined up not 1, but ELEVEN BTC ETF’s, including the BIGGEST FUNDS ON THE PLANET, up to the starting line and is about to pull the trigger on the starting gun. Just a couple of months before a halving! The set-up is absolutely insane. It’s such a colossal own goal it’s as if Gary is about whip the mask off to pop some maxi laser eyes and coldcard cock ring. Lap it up Gentlemen.

Has there ever been a more bullish time to be in Bitcoin? Likely mere hours before ETF approvals and the halving only months away. Not to mention Bitcoin now has survived 3 major cycles.

About 7-8 years I ago I was quoted on the front page of the Financial Times in the UK. The article was the usual anti crypto hit job, and I happened to have a friend who was interning for them at the time and needed someone to counter. I gave them something along the lines of a “Bitcoin is coming, watch this space, fuck you banks” quote, though it was somewhat mutated and sexed up in print (journalism, lol). My friends laughed their heads off at me for a long long long time on that one. ..Hahahahaha...I found it tonight online, and i’d link to it, though prefer not to dox myself. Happy to prove it to the mods. Today I won. It’s going on my wall.

Thank you again sir, right on time:..[https://www.tradingview.com/news/zycrypto:1330fda68094b:0-bitcoin-is-touching-the-ceiling-says-jim-cramer-as-analysts-project-btc-to-smash-110-000-price/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/zycrypto:1330fda68094b:0-bitcoin-is-touching-the-ceiling-says-jim-cramer-as-analysts-project-btc-to-smash-110-000-price/)
15
Couldn't  script a bigger shitshow, absolutely  hilarious. ..It's only a matter of (undisclosed  amount of time) BTC will dominate in the end..Keep the strong hands my friends, you won't regret  it.
14
BTC price does not seem awfully excited about the news
17
CNBC finally confirming…watching now..Edit: Van Eck CEO speaking and encouraging folks to DCA yet said with the “Bitcoin halvening coming up, you want to have some exposure now.”
15
Commissioner Hester Peirce about to be interviewed on Bloomberg, for those interested
15
Gnight gents. Solid day. Y'know that feeling when you break ATH and it's uncharted waters time? That's kinda how I feel rn but on a fundamental/adoption level. The floodgates are truly open now, just gotta see how much water it was holding back
16
Bloomberg is predicting that $4 billion could flow into Bitcoin via ETFs on the first day of trading. The price action over the next few weeks is going to be very very interesting.
15
Do the ETFs start trading tomorrow? Can't wait to see what things are like once the tradfi markets open.
15
Im so hyped
15
its going to take a while for the sell the news losers to sell their shit, then the ETFs will start trading, and then we ride to valhalla.
13
I was expecting everything except the price barely moving lol
14
Huh.. that was a long journey. We can finally go sideways now..
14
Van Eck on CNBC said it's approved for tomorrow.
15
Minimal volatility on the news, remember we're institutionalized now...This is good for Bitcoin. ™
14
Hot take: it gets approved today, launches tmw, no one gives a shit about the twitter hack next week.
29
Are we still going to be approved? I can't shake my sense of impending doom after yesterdays hack for some reason. :/
28
ARKB and HODL are in my fidelity account… I just can’t buy yet.
30
93% of all Bitcoin mined before the big boys have arrived. This is gentlemen
30
To anyone who might see this as Bitcoin “selling out” to the banks or being co-opted somehow, it’s not that at all. I’ve followed this since the very beginning. This is the banks finally bending the knee to Bitcoin. It honestly scares me a little. ..Edit: secure your keys.
31
Today’s the day we get spot ETF approval...First spot ETF application was submitted back in 2013 when price was still below $100. More than a decade later and more than 400x in price since then, the day has finally come...Yesterday’s shenanigans showed us today can be very volatile so it’s best not to be overleveraged in either direction. But once the seed amounts ([still think they get revised up across the board before launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/EVTprX0rZA)) start pouring in and actual spot ETF launches potentially as early as tomorrow, BTC begins to experience its first demand shock ever...Spot ETF approval marks the beginning of the vertical portion of S-Curve adoption. New ATH before the halving for the first time ever incoming.
58
America waking up angry again
12
Okay, is everybody ready to sell the news? All together now.....That's how this works, right?
14
The chart said something has happend?
13
So CBOE moved too quick? What a shit show.
13
Agrr.trade didn't disappoint

12
This is gentlemen!
13
What a rollercoaster of a day.....My dopamine receptors are fried, lol...Cheers to everyone!!!
13
I’m wondering how’s buttcoin doing. Did someone check up on them? They were 100% confident on a rejection.
13
From WatcherGuru on X:..“JUST IN: Bloomberg predicts $4 billion in spot #Bitcoin ETF inflows on the first day of trading, with the possibility of $2 billion directly from BlackRock.”..Using multiplier math (assuming 118x), that means price increase (not accounting for other buys and sells) of $4b div 21m coins x 118 = $22,476 increase per coin...Does that seem like reasonable math? I know the multiplier decreases as price increases, so this number is higher than it should be, but even if it’s close … expect big things tomorrow....https://x.com/watcherguru/status/1745206691228975551?s=46&t=GdsSciOzIxBwNhMx8Lzypg
13
BUY THE NEWS
12
Smoke em if you got em and strap in tight boys TO VALHALLA!
13
Tomorrow will be exciting. I know quite a few boomers willing to add the etf to their portfolios
13
Almost as many comments today as there used to be everyday back in 21. Bullish
13
On second thought *checks Roth IRA, funds still waiting to land for 2024* maybe a big sell the news event wouldn’t be so bad.
13
Well, I guess I'm not working the rest of the afternoon
13
The chart looks bullish as fuck. 6h engulfing after 4h morning star doji.
12
Enjoying my time here until midnight 😎
12
Shitshow: Day 2
12
Honestly, I just opened a beer and enjoy the show. This shit is hilarious.
13
lol of course the actually approval is an uploaded document that you already can't load right now and no official announcement on twitter
12
shorts and longs getting cooked both ways
11
And just like that poof goes gbtc discount
13
We made history! See you all tomorrow for when BTC ETF is approved! And also Friday when it's approved again!..When are we going to sticky an approval thread?
13
So, either..* the markets were so efficient that the approval was perfectly priced in, or.* the markets are so inefficient that they haven't even noticed the approval anniuncement yet
12
Well I think we all called it. Sell the news was a bunch of gnats piss. Well done guys.
11
I really think this will do a lot to legitimize Bitcoin to normies. I've been talking to my coworker (also a good friend) about the ETF for a few months now. He knows I've been into Bitcoin since 2017. He's always been kind of on the fence. Doesn't really believe in it, but is interested in buying some to profit off of the bubbles. Today he said he might finally put a little bit into the ETF, since he doesn't have to worry about self custody, and it removes a barrier to entry. Makes the whole thing just a little bit easier. This somewhat implied acceptance of Bitcoin from the SEC will make it easier for a lot of people to justify buying.
12
Are we going to pass yesterday's fake announcement pump top today?
12
Imagine my surprise to wake up and find the SEC had approved! ..Let the record show I was here this day. ..This is truly gentlemen.
12
Congrats on everyone's patience, this shall be an interesting year.
12
How many bitcoins are even on exchanges..edit; 1.8M including 413k on Coinbase and 121k on Gemini
12
Gary should know better than to leave his phone on the bar when he goes to the toilet for a sniff, one of the boys got him with a beauty there
25
Imagine being a government official and not having fucking 2FA enabled.
25
This price action was totally worth the 10 year wait.../s
25
Here is some indication that the tweet yesterday was not prewritten, but indeed fraudulent. While I wouldn't put to much into using #Bitcoin as word, the formatting issue seems more relevant...Then again, maybe their graphic designer isn't that consistent:..https://twitter.com/herminewong_xyz/status/1744853387500564761
12
Sell the news if withdrawn
10
So, is this 1) a delay of all ETFs, or 2) a withdrawal of CBOEs recent applications because they seemingly have moved too quickly?
12
Absolutely bonkers price action. You love to see it
12
Just wanna remind everyone that aside from the side circus, all of this was literally predicted by the ETF guru bros for at least the last 6 weeks. All the drama was nothing but wasted energy and angst. I had fun though
10
Very biased here but I have no idea why so many are selling into this
11
ok, i'll be the first one to admit. Gensler, you're less of an asshole than i initially thought.
11
Interesting that there is no meaningful bump in the BTC price when the ETF is actually approved vs when the "hacked" tweet went out
11
Who would have thought my altcoins would be outperforming BTC with this announcement? I anticipate the BTC fun will start overnight.
10
And as always the coin surprise everyone with a do-nothing-news, both fucking the degens longs and shorts...It's always the less predictable thing happening.
10
Remember there are plenty of people who will volunteer to be liquidity to stop having to do self custody themselves
9
Makes you wonder what would have happened if the SEC tweet didn't come out yesterday. We would have seen at least a run today, and maybe a crash after. It just happened a day early, and everyone is still just confused
11
Posting for history and heading to the sauna with a full glass - we have some glorious weeks, months ahead...Oh and Gary, you're an asshole. Go back to teaching, you did better then and there. I also bet you have to work tomorrow, don't you?..Edit: Mods, please forgive my victory rant 🫶🏻
11
I suppose people are more cautious after yesterday's PA - hence less volatility (so far - anyway.)
10
Lmao, the Buttcoin cope sesh is starting. “What happened to Gary?!”

Any reason I shouldn't sell my gbtc holdings now and rebuy into another fund with less fees?  I'm in a tax advantaged account, so it doesn't cost me any tax burden

Is it possible to sticky more than one post, I forget?  ..For this day January 10, 2024 forever known as <Meme Nickname Here>; can we unsticky our friend u/Bitty_Bot trades and sticky Bitcoin ETF go-live statuses?  :)

day of BTC ETF approvals and the coin pumping hard is #2. now that is not what i even slighty had expected
11
So let's BRRR and HODL.
10
soooo.....
11
And just think, this is the government department that is suppose to protect us...I bet if the SEC threw a surprise birthday party, they'd invite the birthday guest a half hour before everyone else was scheduled to arrive.
10
BTC goes sideways after all thees sell/buy the news discussions. ..Bitcoin is doing Bitcoin things.

Chalk one up for the wisdom of crowds.  78 votes in the "Today's high on Coinbase will be?" straw poll:..> $55K   5 votes  .$52.5K-$55K   4 votes  .$50K-$52.5K   15 votes  .$47.5-$50K   36 votes  .< $47.5K   18 votes..$47732.50 is today's high on CB with 13 minutes left in the day.

ETF IS LIVE..$ARKB and $HODL listed on Fidelity - Limit orders open
32
While I still believe the SEC can't use this hack as an excuse to deny the ETFs, there still may be the risk that they now have a hard time making today's deadline due to internal chaos/conflict/investigations...If this is the case I'd imagine they'd request ARK to withdraw their application and refile it right after, with the solemn promise they'll keep working on it and likely approve later this week/month...The SEC would only do this if they are forced to though, their main incentive is to approve asap so we all stop talking about their hack.
19
Just imaging my surprise waking up in the UK. What, there were 1000 comments in the previous daily? Heart pumping, is it the day? Proceed to check price, hmm....not much movement, what the hell. Read through previous daily about the shitshow, glad missed most of it while sleeping. This must be the most commented daily with the least amount of price action. ..Anyway, patiently waiting for the inevitable.  All fiat are deployed with moderate leverage, let's go.

Last paragraph from Gary's statement:.."While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\[8\]"..The whole statement conveys the message that he'd definitely have kept rejecting all application, luckily (?) he was backed in a corner by the court order.

Some updated predictions:.- 50k by EOW as ETF volumes turn out good to great (11/13 ETFs approved which is more than I expected and all of them have customers and/or their own funds lined up) Thu/Fri.- New ATH before halving (BTFD in between).- 100k+ before YE, fueled by ETFs, rate cuts (demand+) and halving (supply-).- Blow-off top in 1st HY of '25..I have had this in mind for a while in case of ETF approvals...My - admittedly highly intoxicated - self is taking me to 'other' interesting places too: Out of curiosity, how soon do you expect a short-BTC-ETF to be available? Early 2025, ready for the next bear market?..Ps. Took me 15 min to write this lol (sauna + booz hits hard). Cheers again!
18
Are there any words of experts or ETF issuers regarding the situation? Has been pretty silent and I haven't read a lot of "will still happen" or "this could delay things" statements..
9
I will accelerate some DCA today.
9
Set a sizable limit order buy at $44,000 yesterday. Looks like it might fill soon.
10
*places popcorn in microwave*
9
The bigger question is, would there be a specific approval announcement? Them not announcing would by default approve any ETFs with today’s deadline is my understanding.
9
Fellow Bitcoiners, congratulations!
8
Bitcoin does not need ETFs, but still a historic milestone!
9
Why isn't CNBC (broadcast) cutting away to cover this immediately?!?
10
Still nothing on CNBC?

Surprisingly un-volatile. ..Must be the institutions

It’s going to be really easy for anyone to invest now.  The government approved Bitcoin.  And the fees are low too. No more excuses.  ..I don’t really care about getting a good deal at this point, we should already be in position.  Price needs to be 200k+.
9
I wuz here
9
Hmm modest sell on the news event for now, we’ll see when trading opens up tomorrow
8
See, Bitcoin is a mature market now.
9
Who still thinks the ETF will be denied or delayed?
16
People, the link was actually fetched by a bot which somehow is able to scan for uploads on the site not visible. So probably they wanted it to be ready after market close, but accidentally it was live earlier. ..Bots on Twitter know about all the files minutes to hours before they’re publicised. Probably bad tech backend with SEC, no surprises. ..Probably why it’s 404ing now. Should be again official in few minutes, which would be the 3rd SEC approval. :p
16
Closed 1/4 of my 5x long from ~41k to take some profit and to be able to afford rollover fees without adding funds 'just in case' for another ~2-3 months...I honestly lost some belief in that god candle after yesterday's second fake news event. I still strongly believe we'll get the go-ahead but also think that quite a bit of powder has been shot already, in both directions. The down wick happening *before* Gary's post is what got me questioning short term PA post approval...Counter argument: the smartest and deepest pockets realized the hack quickly and sold hard into it - despite maybe being bullish. They may have even more dry powder now for the real event if they played it well on the 1 min chart...In any case, good luck to you all! Don't over leverage.
16
A lot of confusion around bull market multiple and how price/market cap impacts it...Bull market multiple has more to do with HODL rate than price/market cap. As HODL rate increases, multiplier increases and vice versa...As price increases you would expect HODL rate to decrease but that’s not necessarily the case. For the past year even though price more than doubled, HODL rate increased as well and reached a new ATH even though price has not yet reached new ATH. This indicates as time passes more and more BTC is entering possession of strong hands who aren’t interested in selling. At the same time, new supply being mined is cutting in half every 4 years...Miners are natural forced sellers because they have operating costs they need to cover. Right now 900 new BTC are mined per day. Hypothetically, suppose HODL rate is at 100% and the only sellers are miners. If $1 billion were to come in within a single day to buy the 900 newly mined BTC available for sale, BTC price would need to rise to over $1 million immediately to satisfy the demand...In reality miners aren’t the only sellers, there’s other sellers on any given day. But the higher the HODL rate, the higher the multiplier ends up being. Conversely, the lower the HODL rate, the lower the multiplier ends up being.

love this space, etf approval? EVERYONE ALL IN SHITCOINS.
16
Saw the amount of comments. Saw the news. Checked the price and was 😐
16
At what time would you guess the announcement will be made?
8
Is there any precedent for how the approval would go, for example is it at EOD, or just implicit via them not rejecting it, which would also be EOD, or do they make an announcement during the day? or do we just not know?
8
Another day of history. But so far, rather boring. Let's see what tomorrow brings, when trading actually starts!

What’s the SEC website where we’ll see the official post?

All we can do is watch now
7
Any predictions on which ETF has the largest AUM growth after 30 days?..When I look at Bitwise, am I to assume they only have 2.5m in AUM at this point? That's... nothing.... I can't wait to watch the money flow change.
7
Anyone care to speculate on the color and/or magnitude of tomorrow's daily candle? What are we expecting?? I'll start, by going out on a limb: I think it will be green.
6
SEC is definitely trolling today. They just put out a press release minutes ago and it's about fining SAP for international violations.
15
Etfs feeling like watching a marathon exclusively made up of old people with walkers.
15
US Rep Bill Huizenga (R - Mich) on the ETFs: .."I'm glad to see these ETFs were approved ... Gensler has a track record of over extending (on) legal bounds ... **this is an important step and the right direction** ... for a guy who is by his own admission a bitcoin expert, he has not demonstrated that to a lot of us by the way he has handled it."
15
CNBC will be airing “a huge show on it (Bitcoin) tomorrow morning.” Quoting a CNBC host who said this a minute ago. We all know the power of narratives and news cycles nowadays…
15
/r/investing in shambles
15
Well today is quite a momentous day.  I think we will get our physical ETF approvals this afternoon, and it is hard to overstate how bullish that is.  The long game is that tradfi will want to tempt 10-20% of the total supply of bitcoin out of self-custody and into their coffers strapped down with a recurring 0.2% fee.  Last year dormant coins went from 70%->80% in a year where we tripled in price.  How much does that number need to go up for that to go from 80%-50 or 40%.  Because the ETF's won't be the only buyers in this process, you can't assume they will get 100% of the coins that come off the bench...I'll just tell you that it is roughly SO VERY much higher than current prices.  They will be patient though but I expect a persistent bid of at least 1000 BTC per day for the ETF on average over the next 10 years to get to 15% of the market cap of BTC...This might be the end of the 1st inning now.
24
Just imagine it gets denied now. That would be the ruggest of pulls
25
Is it just me, or do people outside of our bubble do not talk / care / see / know about the ETF?..With the previous ATH, or the 2017 cycle, I remember hearing about bitcoin from random small talk with people, like at a barbershop. I also seemed to see much more discussion online. It seems oddly quiet now.
14
A lot of people are yelling stuff but I'm not able to tell if anything actually happened or we just had a normal bitcoin crash.
14
This feels like explosive diarrhea with no toilet in sight
14
This. Is. Gentlemen...Edit: also i was here
14
Gensler's next two tweets:.."*1) What*".."*2) H*"
15
> Though we’re merit neutral, I’d note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that’s also used for illicit activity including ransomware,[4] money laundering,[5] sanction evasion,[6] and terrorist financing.[7]..Oooh please Gary. Precious metals are not used for these EXACT things?!
14
Cool, I witnessed an ETF for Bitcoin....multiple times
14
Something tells me we're gonna run real soon.
14
Are there any 19b-4s not ready? Any new forms we can expect today, or everything in the final state?
6
Onward and upward boys!
7
even MSTR is green today, huzzah!
8
If the GBTC conversion is also approved, will we instantly see a change in value of GBTC to be in line with the Bitcoin that it holds? The ticker for the ETF is also GBTC, but is it technically going to be a different asset?
7
If you don't set a TP or Stop on bittybot, can you set one after the trade is open? Edit: Also, yesterday there were errors when trying to close a trade when the chart was going wild.

Amazing, as someone who's here since 2011 and invested since 2012 I have to say this is pretty wild. The number go up Trojan horse keeps on tricking more and more of the corrupt establishment into adoption. Love to see it. Next up, more countries adopting.
6
Mind the initial whiplash, the news will take some time to trickle in to the mainstream. Congrats again everyone for the 2nd time, appears it is indeed real!

Have we seen all the seeds land yet? And trading starts tomorrow am. ..I’m excited, 24-25 is going to be a hell of a run
7
Gentleman, we made it!

Self custody is impossible with ETF's, I'm assuming it's just a fund whose price reflects BTC, right?

So is there a reason the charts look like my heartbeat?

So ETFs are going to be buying most likely tomorrow when they start trading?

Decent recovery after the last 24 hours’ dip...Is there any chance this can still be rejected? They’re leaving approval late....Where’s my boy u/Longstronghopiumdong ?!..Krommy here, today’s a day we get to celebrate. 😎

Are they just not going to make an announcement and let everything just start trading tomorrow? That would be so anticlimactic, but also so like the SEC.

Well done everyone! World changing decision today. Now the fiat system can transit to bitcoin standard through the traditional channels. It will take a while but it will make everything so much better to have BTC as the core for world economy. From all persons on earth Garry Gensler had the privilege to do the honors. Maybe motivated a little by a judge but who am i to judge how God works...  all i see is it has a sense of humor.
15
r/investing on absolute suicide watch
15
Second coin did not notice that Gensler revoked the SEC fake tweet...
13
Yesterday we made 1000+ comments. I guess today we will top that.
14
When are we going to have our first post in r/investing asking which regards are now going to take a position in BTC now that Papa Gensler said it's ok? And then as a follow-up, how stupid do they feel having missed out on all those gains for all these years?
13
Bought the dip, and have some schnapps ready for the show. ..Still short of my target in BTC, but it’s close.

What's going on with coin #2?   Shouldn't we be doing all the running and then #2 follows as we catch our breath..?
12
I'm going to go get a drink and just watch the ticker. :)
10
And the official SEC approval is back!..https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/fg-89shlq.pdf..I'm guessing it was accidentally published early, pulled, then republished after market close..EDIT: gone again.  Probably just technical problems with a web server cluster or CDN being out of sync
9
Just hit a new 24 hour high...Looks like spot ETF approval might not have been priced in after all? Perhaps there was just a lag because of yesterday’s shenanigans and market wanted to be certain that the announcement today was real...Whatever the case, launch is tomorrow. And you can’t price in an indefinite demand shock prior to its occurrence just as you can’t price in an indefinite supply shock from the halving prior to its occurrence.
10
Anybody know the time of day the SEC has previously denied ETFs? Was it usually morning or afternoon etc?
5
Where are we looking for approval?..I was under the impression that it was simply a lack of rejection rather than a new twitter post or something like yesterday./..thankjs

Is this where we are watching?..https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases

When people sell ETF-shares, does the ETF need to sell their BTC? Also, is it 1:1 or fractional reserves are possible or is it the opposite where they need to have more supply than current demand?

Hey hey where are yall using leverage nowadays? Genuinely asking for a friend
5
Are most, myself included, not comprehending properly just how much money is going to flow into Bitcoin because of this ETF?..Like…in a reality where the ETF gets approved this week, is $1million per Bitcoin MORE likely by 2030 to happen than not?

So once the approval is there, you are one of the first to know.. what's your trading plan? Eg what PA you guys are expecting?..(for me, mostly crazy volatility tbh lol)

Scaling out of some more longterm bags today, could pump higher but I"m not feeling it and don't care about narratives, don't mind missing the bus I have had such an amazing run, it's been good times! Last couple days feels like the inverse of 11/21/22 when I told people it was capitulation.   We hit a [confluence of three major resistance](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GDfgbIUXAAEOTDm?format=png&name=medium), this is the last re-test of the major top, if this is a major top this will be there area where it tops up to 55k.   Not convinced on the recession yet, but [not liking this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GDfORjxXoAA2inX?format=jpg&name=large) and some other indicators.  We are on the backside of a trendline resistance from 2013, I'm not liking we broke that uptrend and my bread and butter is longterm trendlines.  I have done well with my instincts in the past so I have to stick with it, if we break back above I'll be buying pullbacks if i think things have turned enough.  Good luck homies!

if anyone needs some info on inflow multiple effect on market cap this guy is the glassnode wizard: https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1745230369992122846.  .TLDR; 4x-5x. So my quik maffs of 20b inflow means 80b added to market cap which means 80/909+1*46000 = 50000. Certainly not hopium inducing you just need to 10x the inflow to 200b and then we are high af at 500k.

FYI...From the market depth on Coinbase. It looks like there are 10% more sell orders in the que than there was a couple of hours ago.

Well, I guess 86% likelihood of approval means... 14% chance of nonsense.  I don't know why I got my hopes up that the government would do anything more than perpetuate the status quo.  Thankfully, we can still use our inflation riddled fiat currency at banks that commit criminal and civil violations with our money, knowing we are safe since the banks are regulated by... their own former executives.

Slow burn, but BTC is going to move upwards now.  ..The next catalyst will be ETF inflow data, in the coming days and weeks, at least if they are impressive.

Do we have any idea about this whole seeding thing, should we assume every institution already secured (optional in case of approval) OTC deals already and there will be no free lunch in terms of price action? Or is someone finally gonna pump our bags out of necessity?

I am now carefully monitoring LTC/BTC ratio.  In 3 out of the 5 times when LTC/BTC ratio mooned (i.e. +30 to 50% move in less than a week), that signaled the end of the run and we entered into a correction stage.  The LTC/BTC ratio is historically low at 0.0015 and I think some time between now and end of this month, that will go up to 0.002.  Then, we enter a correction phase before the halving...Also, if Bitcoin does not correct here (and I think it might stall out under 48K for a couple of weeks), then we will have a full blown altseason here.

> Importantly, today’s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission’s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission’s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws. As I’ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.- Gary..ETH ETF seems DoA

SEC warnings of market manipulation, then proceed to manipulate market day before deadline is fishy af. Even Gary Gensler's tweet about investing in crypto is manipulating the market, ridiculous.  A delay would seem sensible on their part. Gary tweeting it is not approved yesterday then approving today would be crazy. Either they are completely incompetent or they are crooks. Don't know what is worse.

A nice little wick up to .05425 on the ratio. Anyone who was more than about 8x long from the bottom got rekt. Seems to be mostly the result of rotation out of alts back into coin2 and associated derivatives and L2s. Zooming out though we can see these upticks do happen quite frequently. Approval may be hours away so there’s still time for the ratio to push higher, but I think we’ve hit the local top - or are at least close to one.

A few months ago I converted half of my IRA to BITO and the other half to GBTC...BITO has been severely lagging.  I'm wondering for those that hold this are you planning on moving to an ETF?

Last comment from me about if this is a sell the news event using three criteria and the datapoint from yesterday’s shitshow:..1) Is this a publicly known event? Yes.2) Has this event been known for some time? Yes.3) Has the price pumped in anticipation of the event? Yes.4)* Did price reject strongly off ~$48K yesterday BEFORE the market got clarification that the announcement was fake? YES..so, the only question left to answer is if this top that we get here, whether it’s $48K, $52K whatever marks a major local time or LONG TERM top. What if this is the yearly high? How do you plan around that when so many people here think a new ATH is around the corner?

My theory is that $1 trillion of market cap is a huge psychological resistance level for the foreseeable future.  ..At $1 trillion Bitcoin would be in truly rarefied air - more valuable than all but 6 companies in the world, almost as valuable as the world's supply of silver, and nearly 1/10th the value of the world's gold.  It's going to take a hell of a lot of conviction from non-crypto bro institutional investors to push it into multi-trillion dollar territory.

The SEC tweet looked real legit. I don't buy the hack story, I think they fucked up and posted a tweet instead of saving it as a draft for today..The fact that Gensler reacted inside of 3 minutes only supports my theory. Hell, it probably took north of 1 minute to redact and proofread it. The person who fucked up probably ran to Gensler for damage control. There is no way they'd react that quickly to a "hack"...Edit: I was mistaken about the 3 minutes but I still think that the theory could be valid.

I'm liking this eth pump. Gives me an idea of how long I should hold it at the end of the cycle when it pumps before I swap it back to btc and wait for the dump.

now they'll tell you you were lucky

Them being approved was priced in...The effect that the money that will flow in when they start trading is what's unknown.

awesome to see

He understands Bitcoin.  Gensler is something of a historical figure now.
11
 It’s a funny story, but has no positive or negative effect.
6
Even weirder, they were approved for listing on "all registered national stock exchanges".  Not just the stock exchanges they'd applied to be listed on, but _all_ stock exchanges.
10
I gotta admit half the reason I’m in Bitcoin is for the excitement and entertainment value. The other reason is generational wealth and financial freedom, but don’t discount the lolz along the way …
27
The weekly still looks bullish AF.

So much negativity here - I don't understand why. There will be two times in Bitcoin: .1) Pre-ETF.2) Post-ETF

they'll have to pry it from my dead, cold wallets.

You have to place trade to get me to show your balance as flair ;)

And hilariously, "ETF APPROVED" (ie past tense) is trending...The 4chan-ization of twitter really has been something to behold...Edit: But thanks for all you do /u/NLNico, that wasn't aimed at you.

Funny that FBTC isn't on there yet though

She's livestreaming to say nothing new?

> sometime after the close of trading..Joke's on us. Bitcoin trading never closes.
7
The caveat makes it seem legit
5
Yeah, which is inline with the Bloomberg terminal window of ~4-6 PM EST (the only time zone that matters!  =P)...Was thinking we'd see the announcement take place no earlier than 4:01 PM EST to "trap" whatever trades are bound by Wall St operating hours.  NGU after 4:00 PM and make the seeds buy in at a higher point, etc., *if* trading begins tomorrow January 11.

Interesting part at the end...> Though we’re merit neutral, I’d note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that’s also used for illicit activity including ransomware,[4] money laundering,[5] sanction evasion,[6] and terrorist financing.[7]..> While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.[8]**..The whole text read like a "sorry we couldn't refuse it this time" more than anything.
12
How do I know this is a legitimate post actually made by the SEC? ;)..> Circumstances, however, have changed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the Commission failed..Interesting that it only took him 2 paragraphs to say *"Courts forced me"*...> metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that’s also used for illicit activity including ransomware,[4] money laundering,[5] sanction evasion,[6] and terrorist financing.[7]..Wow he actually closes with buttcoin *"Won't anyone think of the children"* nonsense...> we did not approve or endorse bitcoin...Bitcoin don't care.

Kept buying and now I’m rewarded

Really makes no sense garbage can alts are up, like who is buying that shit? It's all garbage lol

I suspect that there was supposed to be an orchestrated “sell the news“ dump at announcement and those plans got ruined yesterday.  So now it’s just flat until money flows in.

Isn't it crazy how year after year ETF's were denied yet when Blackrock decides to file for one, woosh, approval of all.
13
I needed this post, genuinely
8
I was just thinking the same thing. The impact this will have on the price and the legitimacy of bitcoin would be so much greater, than if the Winkelwii ETF was approved as is.
8
It’s the “institutional adoption” dream becoming reality. And to think just like the internet cash narrative coming to pass, 4 years later we will experience it all again with whatever narrative will be on the menu next. I’m scared to speak too soon lol
8
Not to mention right before they start doing rate cuts to devalue fiat even more.

Serious question about 2FA - I'm assuming multiple people have access to this account, @secgov.  How do you implement 2FA on an account with multiple users?..Idk how X works. Can they do 2fa through email? You can't tie it to a phone number because then only the phone number on the account would be able to access it. Again, I don't know how it works on X.
6
It also looks like the hacker telegraphed control and timing to accomplices via liking other posts with the SEC account prior to posting the fake approval.
11
Who on earth creates accounts for _anything_ using a phone number rather than an email address?  Just because you _can_ doesn't mean you _should_.  (Yes, I know that on X, using a phone number is the default for new accounts if you don't want to use a Google or Apple account, but still....)
3
I think it's more the irony. If any of the ETF providers had accidentally posted that from their twitter the SEC would come down on them hard for market manipulation. But when the SEC does it, nothing is going to come of it. Who polices the police? The system is fucked.
12
"It's not personal, it's just business."

There's basically no FUD right now... But the market is pretty inefficient so it's far from priced in. I believe we're looking at a generational event akin to the late 90s tech boom... This is going to be the mother of all bubbles in 3-5 years. Imagine what happens when there's no deep bear market before the 2028 halving. People will lose their minds.
5
Part of me thinks it's "too easy" and that we will inevitably crater back into the 20s rather than pump past 100k

Gary's trying to tweet that, but his Twitter account has also been compromised.

Open shut case of negligence. I'm just interested to see if it's civil, criminal, or both. Given it's the state, probably just get away with it.
5
This is all so great for consumers.  Kind of what happens when the SEC allows an ETF it should have granted a decade ago.  Now calculate the losses from GBTC fees and people losing their BTC because they aren’t competent enough to self custody.  They could have bought a spot ETF that was perfect for them and still experienced the benefits of Bitcoin as a monetary base and an escape from out of control USD printing.
6
Do people not understand that if anything is approved, a massive amount of money will flow into Bitcoin?
7
Is GBTC among them? I don't know the numbers...Edit: Yes it is.

I read this and made a mess on myself

Well if you listened to r/BitcoinMarkets one hour ago you would think the whole thing was cancelled

So is everyone else after yesterdays bullshit

So much better than Gary’s rant against bitcoin. ..> Although this is a time for reflection, it is also a time for celebration. I am not celebrating bitcoin or bitcoin-related products; what one regulator thinks about bitcoin is irrelevant. I am celebrating the right of American investors to express their thoughts on bitcoin by buying and selling spot bitcoin ETPs.[10] And I am celebrating the perseverance of market participants in trying to bring to market a product they think investors want. I commend applicants’ decade-long persistence in the face of the Commission’s obstruction...This is the crux which I strongly agree with.
29
Wow that is quite the statement.
2
63k btc tmmrw okay got it!
12
Is it possible that they have been buying in anticipation of this approval, meaning that much of those inflows may already be priced in?
9
That would be insane
7
That BofA analysis isn’t reliable. No way to measure how much inflows can move price because there’s no way to measure the opposite for outflows
4
I see a lot of predictions on here like this but no "I am 10x long with X amount".  Not judging but to me it says most of it is just guessing and passing the time.  At least we will know soon!
2
Thank fuck he’s bearish. ..You know, it requires extremely high skill to be wrong ALL the time. Maybe he’s a time traveller and is intentionally posting the opposite things.
12
All hail the opposite Cramer
10
At this point he knows and is just trolling.
8
It's almost like there is no instant inflow, almost like seed amounts are only a float to lubricate the system, almost like it's just a product launch which will take to time to market and sell to people.

ETH does though.  ATH net worth on this day.

> we're institutionalized now...Speak for yourself.  I know of at least one lunatic who's still free-range.
10
>gives..I'm not so sure, a lot of people use ETHBTC as a counter trade to soften dips (basically, when Bitcoin tops out, you switch to Eth on the ride down, then switch back to BTC near the bottom, usually turns the 60% dip into a 10% dip, go look at the chart)...it was tracking nicely with the rise in Bitcoin price, but since the tweet it's all messed up...Essentially, the SEC hack has essentially butchered that play. At least for now, unless Eth returns to where it was on the way up (if we get a rocket)...Here is a before and after look.....[https://imgur.com/a/MztcETO](https://imgur.com/a/MztcETO)

10
Wouldn't surprise me if some insiders know that a delay or denial is coming... We've lost $2500 over the last 24 hours. If an ETF approval is imminent, who in their right mind would be selling now?..Gary is going to drag this nonsense out as long as he can, so that he can "protect us" by causing bitcoin holders the most stress possible.
11
Doubled down on my long at 44.9.

What does this mean? People keep saying this. ..If ARK withdrew, it’s done. Not getting approved today.

Trying to apply Hanlon's Razor here -- "never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity" -- but I honestly believe these people are doing all this on purpose to cause panic and chaos. They're not dumb...This shit doesn't happen with generic ETFs or IPOs or anything else. Then Bitcoin comes along, and it's literally years of hemming and hawing, and one fuck-up after another.

The price of spot BTC is not going to jump $22,476 tomorrow ..BlackRock is going to buy $2b from an OTC desk and the desk's market maker algorithm adjusts
12
You can't just use a simple multiplication to calculate the effects of an $X billion inflow. Even if you assume the books do not change, you have to know the books of ALL exchanges in the world. And you don't...But it's even more complicated than that. The books change. The higher the price, the higher the sell pressure...But it's even more complicated than that. When the price spikes, FOMO can kick in, which increases buying pressure...And all of that can be negated if some whale decides to buy or sell a huge chunk.
8
Max is probably right. Shock and awe will probably keep the candle under 10k. But, it could go higher. I’ve calculated the multiplier to be closer to 150 recently. What happens when nobody sells?30k? 40k? ..We’ll just have to see.
6
A new ATH even a week after the ETFs debut would be a thing to behold. Getting there on the *first day* would be absolutely nuts!
5
Math sounds about right if it’s $4 billion in net inflows and there isn’t an additional $4 billion in selling pressure added outside of the ETF’s to match it...[Explained in a comment earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/c75Q6LV042) that bull market multiple is more heavily dependent on HODL rate than price/market cap and HODL rate has been trending up for the past year. The higher the HODL rate is, the higher the multiplier ends up being and vice versa.
4
That would basically take us to ATH tomorrow. Highly unlikely.
8
There will be some sellers along the way
4
>“JUST IN: Bloomberg predicts $4 billion in spot #Bitcoin ETF inflows on the first day of trading, with the possibility of $2 billion directly from BlackRock.”..A lot of that money may be pulled from other bitcoin proxies, that means that that money does not create net new demand.
7
I'm hearing 70K and set my position (3x from 45.55K) to close at 69,420.69.  If it happens, it will be the most profitable trade so far.
5
I think $4B is a bit high. Most people buying on ETFs would go to their financial advisors, and maybe take a few days to buy.
1
I'm waiting.  I understand that it's the beginning of the year, but the market is at an ATH.  A 10% drop would be a great buy for the years going forward.  Even 5% would be nice.

Gensler and some lesser coworkers probably engineered this whole thing themselves, out of spite, just to inject FUD into the market. He's literally putting out PSAs warning about FOMO and trying to dissuade people away from anything bitcoin-related...Has that ever happened in the history of ETFs or IPOs or similar? "*Here's a new product to invest in, but I urge you not to do so!*" ... I doubt it.
5
Just remember ."Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC,” .-maybe the SEC
12
Imagine being a government IT department and deciding to register your social media accounts to some cellphone number rather than to an @sec.gov email address...The fact is that social media generally isn't considered to be "proper" IT and is as likely to have been set up by an intern as by the IT department.

Better proof is the SEC liked two different crypto twitter posts and also posted just "BTC." before deleting.
10
The image just looks amateur...*"Bigger is better"* the head-shot should be filling the space, there is way too much empty background...Similarly the font should be much larger...The signature too could be stretched out and include full titles...Also I'd expect to see a government seal...edit: .....Like this: https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1666059252442746881/photo/1..Or this where they went as far as adding horizontal rule to the signature line: https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1686042971190272000..Or these where his head is huge: https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1497248631690252291 https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1602661434541981697..Notice that they do a much better job of paying attention to the justification of the text too.

Lots of dumb money following idiots with "clout" who say this is a sell the news event and we've topped. I just don't understand the rationale.
3
There are traders who were just trading the approval and who didn’t have any other views about Bitcoin. Which is fine, they got a good return and fucked off. Now the real show starts...I think it’s going to be more of a train building massive momentum throughout the year more than anything else. The ETFs are the final on-ramps for massive capital and now we’ll still need the halving to drive all out wild FOMO...End of the year will be a massive party for us 😂
2
I don’t think he ever really hated Bitcoin or anything. But at this point he didn’t have enough political capital to stop the ETFs anyways. The rebuke from the judges over the GBTC mess was pretty harsh.

OMG 404 means ETF Denied! GARY!!!

what you have to realise about politicians is that it's often just about taking the path of least resistance, and that became to approve the ETFs

I'd rather see a slow grind up personally.

most predictable thing is max pain.

Look at the ETHBTC chart. All the people that would have dumped are trapped...the rest that were targeting a lower Eth entry didn't get to play because it came a day early...so they're just hodling...What we're probably going to see at some point is a large dump on the ETHBTC pair while BTC rallies because they will want to escape...those folks are going to get burned.

I'm tempted to consider it was all intentional, but I really don't think they are that smart.

> The best minds are not in government...They do have the best grifters though.
5
idk I'm not going to suddenly start believing things from a Musk company. Usually you would talk with the account owner about what happened and it would be up to them to decide what information to release. Saying 2FA was or was not enabled leaks information that could be used to target other government accounts. Just say nothing...Musk also hates the SEC. Maybe he was in the middle of a ketamine binge and impersonated the account himself just to fuck with them.
13
Now Musk has an history of loving playing with news, especially about crypto. I wouldn't be surprised if he learned about it before but kept it until it would be maximally impactful.
-1
Wait until the discount closes. It’s still like 7(edit)percent down..But then yea absolutely sell and buy lowest fee etf
18
what nottafed said, don't sell before it actually converts(or whenever the discount goes away, might be right after approval)  or you're throwing away free money.
6
Funds haven't launched yet. If approved there would be a spike in price. Don't sell unless you are better on denial. Sell only if you can buy the ETF on same day as you sell GBTC.

Not that I’m aware of but aside from lower fees this is an easy way to differentiate yourself from your competitors so I wouldn’t be surprised if at least one of them do it which forces others to follow suit.
7
Yes they will have to disclose their holdings.  Don’t know it’s annually or quarterly
2
first i read “in bitcoin cash” and was extremely confused
2
I see it on mine too.
10
But are any orders actually fulfilled? Or is it just a kind of pre-loading of the order book before launch?..Either way, that sounds like it is truly a done deal.

Live, as: tradable?

Can't see anything on vanguard yet

If that's the case the price is rather flat in response.

The 19b-4s *should* be final already though, so they could always just approve these and delay the S-1s if needed (no deadline on it.) Still assume quick approval for S-1 too though.

Makes this approval that much sweeter...Fuck Gary Gensler

I can't imagine there's ever been a single similar event in history where the SEC has said: "Here's a new investment product, please don't buy into it."..Really, way to be impartial, Baldo.

You forgot...he says if you buy bitcoin you're funding TERRORISM!..He knows who he wants to work for...Suck it Gary.

Bro you could die! Get some nose beers in ya and even yourself out mate!

Why would it delay anything? Tweets don’t decide a meeting. There was discussion, paperwork, etc. I can’t see how it would be relevant.
16
> Are there any words of experts or ETF issuers regarding the situation?..If it mattered, there would be more content around it.  THere's no map for this, and it went down after hours, less than 12 hours ago.   IMO This is a storm in a teacup - likely that no "experts" with any competence was F5'ing on reddit last night to see it going on, they were asleep or with their families.  Even if you heard anything it would be PR garbage, or worse, an op/ed.
1
Nice buy. I noted it in todays daily. Maybe someone remembers it next episode of FOMO.  Continued good luck.
2
The SEC twitter has been a solid source for investors
17
Kind of...The ONLY ETF with a deadline today is ARK. No announcement would be an approval of ARK ONLY...This would create an unfair disadvantage to the other 10 filers who would be left out in the cold until their deadline in March. The SEC isn't likely to take this path...SEC COULD ask ARK to withdraw voluntarily. But considering Cathy is sitting on Bloomberg TV talking about how she doesn't expect the "hack" yesterday to change things, I assume she's not into it...Therefore, I think it's likely we either see a denial of ARK (which they may chose to refile and see if they can get an approval with the others) OR an approval of all 11.
9
I'm sure the ETF issuers will say something.
7
Dude. Come on.
3
They're a cheap bit of entertainment. They're not going to actually jump to scoop news when they can lazily produce shitty content.
1
I have it on. Nothing yet.
4
What's crazy is, they spent half the morning yapping about the hacked X account, but actual substantive financial /regulatory history doesn't merit coverage yet.
3
It was just on Fox Biz.  Price keeps leaking.  That’s OK.
2
Perhaps that was the whole point of these never-ending fuckups -- get people so confused they don't even trust when SEC.gov posts actual approval PDFs.
5
Pretty sure his vision wasn't an ETF.
6
Damn, was about to post this.
1
Is it confirmed anywhere they start trading tomorrow? As in tomorrow is when supposed 1-2B of capital is being deployed? I guess we’ll see the volume and know soon enough.
2
Delayed and we get a green dildo. My random guess.

2
> So probably..CAP theorem. Sometimes what you get when you hit a web server can be less than consistent, but eventually consistent...> Bots on Twitter know about all the files minutes to hours before they’re publicised...Bots on twitter know the future? I am confuse.
1
I really think there are people who get information just a tad quicker then the masses. ..God candle etc is not something I’m counting on. I’ll just be happy to see rising volume in those new ETF’s during the next months..
5
I think for a sober mind it was pretty obvious how fake that initial tweet was, and I do think that down wick was due to quick money realising it was fake and selling because of it. ..I mean it had a freaking Bitcoin hashtag. In retrospect that was obviously fake.
2
Really good points. Plus so many people want 6 figures now that they're prepared to wait. Who really wants to sell at $90,000?
7
It's their Hail Mary to squeeze as much ratio as they can out before BTC annihilates them for the foreseeable future.
3
Sir we are in tradfi now, it's called sector rotation.

They aren’t required to say anything. If they don’t, it means approval of Ark / 21Shares.
10
I think we need to realize that the guy wearing sandals and socks or white New Balances is not up to date on things.  He will find the ETF two months or a year from now and go balls deep as he learns what Bitcoin is and can buy it safely in his retirement account.
13
Gary Gensler is on reddit and he will be announcing the rejection of all Bitcoin ETFs himself in rbuttcoin as payback for all the abuse he’s received here.

No, not necessarily. Word on the street is that it may come in "after trading hours", but this doesn't mean on point.

They're still in denial. Might have a little more time to stack after all.

Wow, serious salt over there. I did see some thoughtful comments about possible using these ETFs to short Bitcoin. Hopefully that person is wrong about that!
1
>  tempt 10-20% of the total supply of bitcoin out of self-custody and into their coffers strapped down with a recurring 0.2% fee...Very adept way of putting it...Much marketing...>  1st inning ..Cricket or baseball?
6
I don't even care which way it goes, just get rid of the blue balls already.
13
The average person doesn't even know what ETF's are.
24
At previous ATH, the Coinbase app was the top app on the entire app store. It’s not even top 20 in the finance section right now. Either the rise hasn’t even gotten started (bullish) or it’s not going anywhere (bearish)
9
everyone knows bitcoin , it's not new,  all have their opinion on it pretty much. it's either they like it or they see no value in it. an ETF won't change their opinion on it, it's pretty much a new tool for wallstreet . ..honestly, around me the mass don't give a fuck about btc, the implication to buy it , buy stuff, get hacked and taxes is just one more headaches. an etf won't make btc money of the future, maybe a store of value for wall street. not sure thats what Satoshi envisionned.
9
Outsiders don't care until after ATH...It leads to a new narrative, uncharted territory and a new media hype cycle.

My friends who only trade TradFi (most via Fidelity accounts) have been asking me questions for weeks now. I just texted a reply to one seconds ago...Edit: adding that all of them hold GBTC and like the profits they’ve made swing trading it to build their stacks (GBTC has been the gateway drug for TradFi normies)

So nice they approved it thrice.

btc ran from october to january. what more do people want?
3
ETH is on a tear so maybe BTC will jump to make the ratio back in line.
1
>If the GBTC conversion is also approved, will we instantly see a change in value of GBTC to be in line with the Bitcoin that it holds?..Not instant. The market mechanism to enforce equilibrium with the underlying asset requires that the ETF be openly trading. So it will equilibrate shortly after actual trading begins...As an aside, this also means that the price drifts in the ETFs away from the underlying bitcoin price will be larger when the US market is closed (because the ETF price will be stuck)...Edit: But there  will be some instantaneous change I think. You'd have to be an idiot to sell at a discount after the ETF conversion has been approved.
5
You can simply open a new trade with the same amount and leverage and add your TP or SL...Since opening a new trade closes your current trade and replaces it with the new one at exactly the same price, with no slippage, the result is simply adding a SL or TP (or both)...&#x200B;..>Edit: Also, yesterday there were errors when trying to close a trade when the chart was going wild...I think I remember seeing you mixing up the order of some parameters in your commands, for example I saw a `short close` from you, which the command is just `close`. Make sure you get those commands right, check my docs or message me if you ever need any help...The way I'm programmed, volatility doesn't affect me opening and closing trades as long as the Coinbase API is up (which it was all day yesterday).

> What a time to be alive, what a show...It's a certain type of show. 💩

nah,..buy the dip
5
The seeds are a bit of an irrelevance. They may even be hedged with shorts.  In fact, given the expected market volatility around the event, they almost certainly are hedged...The goal of the funds and market makers is to provide a means of buying bitcoin - they will aim to minimise their own exposure to the bitcoin price...The  significant net flows into BTC from the ETFs are directly linked to the flows _into_ the ETFs, so can't happen until the markets open...The ETFs and associated participants don't (shouldn't) care whether BTC goes to the moon or goes to zero.  They take their cut either way
12
ETFs + halving = six figure Bitcoin.
11
Yes, but the ETF issuers have to back it with actual Bitcoin.
8
Yes, pretty sure CB will be the custodian for most of the ETF’s, so it is a not your keys investment.
6
Cut back on the amphetamines. 😵‍💫
12
Very sensible as always..This is a very important price point. As in the previous cycles, it needs to be properly touched by the halving for the bull cycle to go on. But indeed there are still 3 months until that, so the price might pause first.

Who gives a f\*\*k what they think, in real life, I convinced zero (yes, no one) people to buy bitcoin. Every time I show my real passion and people think I am a crack head.  I don't talk about it anymore in real life, for most part just pretend I don't know Bitcoin.  Hell let them stay happily poor.

The saltiness on that sub is hilarious. Those clowns missed out BIG time

Most obvious trade in history, because it's the not so obvious counter trade...Ratios got absolutely hammered across the board..I expect a run till around 3.6k before BTC leads again

5
People are waiting for some grand proclamation, but they may just quietly make these things available for trading without saying anything. When has the SEC done literally *anything* to put Bitcoin in a positive light? Not saying anything forces people to find out the ETFs are live on their own, or at least from other sources.
6
You even asking? The best source of information on the SEC is the SEC
2
This is a slow burn kind of thing. A few years from now the inflection will be very obvious

I like that we're getting our ETF approval news from some dude's Google Drive, after being bamboozled first by a Cointelegraph intern, and then a Twitter hacker.

[effacé]

You can still sell now?
2
I don't think that's going to happen.  It's actually up afterhours for what its worth
2
For what it's worth, I'm in a discord where a lot of people think that MSTR is oversold right now and will regain some of its premium. If you don't see big outflows in these next couple days, it's likely to recover imo. It's lost like 20% of its premium so far. We'll see...
1
The news didn't sell...however, you've just started a new rumour...so...
-1
>When people sell ETF-shares, does the ETF need to sell their BTC?..No. The shares are traded between stock exchange participants..."Authorized Participants" (APs) can bring cash to the ETF administrator and get shares to sell on the stock exchange (and the admin buys the corresponding amount of btc), or conversely bring shares to the ETF administrator and get cash (and the admin sells the corresponding amount of btc). This mechanism of APs is how the ETF is assured to be close to the underlying price of bitcoin...>Also, is it 1:1 or fractional reserves are possible or is it the opposite where they need to have more supply than current demand?..The shares are 1:1 with the amount of underlying btc for each etf. I do not know how much each ETF share requires in btc, that number is almost certainly in the prospectus or S-1...Edit: remove stray paren.
9
No fractional reserves since Coinbase is the custodian for everyone and their market caps are public. When you buy new etf shares the market cap of the etf goes up and they have to have Bitcoin custodied at Coinbase to match or it’ll be very obvious something is wrong.
7
Derebit. But your friend needs to be careful not to feed the liquidation monster.
3
Unpopular here but I like using WBTC and doing it that way. I’d rather trust a defi app than something like Deribit.
2
Personally anticipating fund managers who have applied for spot ETF to reach 1% allocation of total AUM ($170 billion out of $17 trillion) into BTC within the next 4 years which translates to BTC being $1 million by end of 2027 due to high bull market multiple where every $1 billion coming in translates to a BTC price increase of ~$5.6k...Spot ETF approval marks the beginning of the vertical portion of S-Curve adoption.
12
The sell the news smoothbrains (apparently) think $0 will be flowing into BTC etfs, but the truth will be something in the middle. A lot of bulls here think 1b is a lot, but binance spot does 3b vol candles a day. This can be tempered with "wash-trade" allegations etc but coinbase will do 1b a day for strong vol days, so its got to be substantial. Of course sellers might just not be there and buyers will have to chase bid higher.
5
My trading plan is roughly this:.. * cry that MSTR is down again. * do nothing with my hodl stack..but it's still a work in progress.
17
Put [aggr.trade](https://aggr.trade) with max volume on my tv, get some popcorn and enjoy the show.  ...Same plan for any decision of the SEC BTW.
12
>So once the approval is there, you are one of the first to know.. what's your trading plan?..Break open one of my best bottles and raise a glass to Satoshi. And then another...I'm fully confident this strategy will result in terrific returns.
23
If it’s genuinely approved without any funny business I’m deploying significant fiat regardless of any sell the news price action. In fact I would welcome any decent sell off after historical bullish news like that
12
I'd be set up ready to snipe long on any market dump as soon as price stabilized...Expecting crazy volatility and then meh. The grind up will happen as the ETFs start buying. How high up it goes depends on how much demand comes in...The interplay between the ETFs on market open and close and the spot 24/7 market will be interesting.
10
wait for god candle > 5-10k, then sell position I acquired awhile ago for this event.  If no god candle, do nothing.  I thought we would have a lot more runup/hype around etf approval so a bit of a letdown so far.
8
I’m in for the swing… it’s too insane really to trade, I’m here for whatever comes. Bring it.
8
Trading plan remains the same.  Invest early and often.
6
Yes. Volatility.
5
I was of the view of let it run and then short whenever the mtgox creditors start receiving bitcoin payments... That plan has been thrown in the trash because of the trustee's incompetence. I just have spot exposure ('HODL') at the moment and am not changing until there is news on large supplies of BTC becoming unlocked.

It’s missing the green candle (the 3rd of the 3) that indicates a bullish reversal. The 3 candle is currently red yet has a bit less than 3 hours to complete the pattern by turning green...Edit: just read prior comment, which I repeated.

Well, it seems to be reversing. :)

I think this is why we're not seeing movement. Where is the news
5
Interesting, so the withdrawal letters everyone is sharing is to cancel the original request for trading to begin 1/11 and instead replace it with the "acceleration" 8-A12B request and immediately begin trading...Do I have that right?  ...Edit: Maybe not, the twitter post you linked is from 4 hours ago so it seems out of order.
5
Then have a boating accident?
7
Just need to 10x it
3
That's realized cap tho, not market cap. ..$20B of pure purchases - That's 435k BTC at $46k...That's Coinbase's entire balance of BTC...That's 2 Microstrategys worth of BTC...That's almost an entire GBTC.
2
Going to be more of a slow rise here until ETF flows hit and even then GBTC makes it unclear whether initial flows are positive or negative since a lot of big firms were playing the discount...I think we go up bigly this week.

Differential should be arb'd away. I don't think these require huge overhead, especially when they using a third party custodian.

And to those who have been holding on throughout the painfully deep discounts.

Was everyone expecting an instant 10k drop?

He said the opposite yesterday
2
realistically they are hedging vehicles for active managers, meaning they buy if it goes down and sell when it goes up. We'll probably see less volatility long-term because of ETFs
11
Ooooh I would love for them to try that. Bitcoin has never been kind to shorters. They always get rekt eventually
6
Yes...Edit: liquid options for spot market that aren’t on-chain.

>Do these ETFs make it easier for tradfi d-bags to short the coin?..Yes, just as it makes it easier for tradfi to long the coin. It will also make options easily available.

I would caution people to be careful when comparing BTC or an ETF with a stock.  Stock prices are calculated based on estimates of future earnings and other issues.  Commodities are priced on use and supplies—including the estimates of future harvests, mining or other creation...Bitcoin is not in the stock category at all.  It IS in the second category—and the future growth of supply is well known.  This is quite different than gold or wheat.   So, the delta comes from a use model.  ..While it’s reasonable to think the use model will improve over the coming years, that is something that can be controlled...It will be interesting to see how these ETF companies will position the offering.  Once you get past, “It’s bitcoin, bruh” that is where the real analysts and managers come in.

Nobody is forced to buy a bitcoin etf - it's not comparable.

BITO 2025 call gang represent!

Yup, I bought some BITO $35 Jan 2025 calls on Monday, for $1.66 each. Might buy some on one of the new ETFs once they get options chains, too.

clean your room
1
As investors buy the ETF, the ETF buys bitcoin. It's just going through a 3rd party but adding buying pressure all the same.
8
The seeding was peanuts. Mayyybbbee $50M but probably less. If you believe the reports, the funds will purchase between $1-5B tomorrow, and we will officially be getting our bags pumped.
7
We should assume that they will need to buy the underlying asset, and they won't be able to call their buddy at the bullion bank up to fake reserves.  ..At this point, I am assuming that BlackRock and all those guys are running the exact same bots we've seen since 2014 but with larger amounts of money in play.  Trying to accumulate?  Buy some, dump some.  Buy some, dump some.  Saylor's bot was much better.  Buy steadily, let some profit taking occur, rinse, repeat.  The buy-some-dump-some bot ends up losing the buyer a fuckton of money due to the rare and non-fakeable nature of Bitcoin.

21 million is 21 million

There's limited coin available so even if they procure it through OTC deals, it still means less available for everyone else. This might be a literal race to get the best price tomorrow if we do see a supply shock due to increased demand.

Flat but BTC dominance falls over 2%, #2 pumps 7% and top ALTs doing good. WUT???

There's no assurance that these ETFs get big flows. Some people probably believe they wont lead to significant changes in buying pressure, so are selling at a high before finding out for sure.

lol. Theyre waiting for it on the official SEC site as an announcement. Not knowing the file link was leaked through a bot. Or I guess they can’t report that, if that counts as an ‘unethical source’. ..This is the second technical fuck up by SEC in 24 hours.
11
I heard that too. I assume they are being extra careful after yesterday.
3
Huh they said that???
2
Yeah nobody cares about money or anything right?

The SEC is incompetent. It’s really that simple. These are human beings, not gods amongst us. They need to approve it now more than ever, so the conversation shifts away from how dumb they are for allowing their Twitter account to get hacked on the eve of one of the biggest ETF launches in market history. ..The irony of the governing body in charge of “protecting” consumers, combating fraud and market manipulation - not even being able to properly secure a Twitter account… it’s just laughable.
14
> Gary tweeting it is not approved yesterday then approving today would be crazy...This is what I'm wondering about as well.
12
>Gary tweeting it is not approved yesterday then approving today would be crazy. .."Not approved" does not mean "denied". It only meant it was not approved (yet) at that moment.
11
Let's not over-do this. The SEC will use their own website to announce decisions - we all just got very overexcited.
14

My normie friends who don't know I have BTC asking if they should invest in the ETF for retirement. In several years are we going to look like the genius money that bought before the ETF?
1
[effacé]
1
I don’t view it as outperforming if it’s still playing catch up on several time frames
11
Everyone who follows crypto... knew or expected this to occur a while ago. This is why something gets "priced in" as the date approaches. It's public information. The only thing that's not priced in now is the kind of demand the funds will expect tomorrow and the seed money that will be used to buy BTC. My guess is price goes up... to 49k or some thing from the actual demand from ETF's and then demand fizzles out. Today had very climactic vibes especially with how the alts reacted to the news.
10
hmm, I dunno... maybe... capital cannot enter the market until it opens? I think retail is broke, I think yesterday the fake tweet spared us misery of the sell the news crowd, and today there is just no more sell or buy pressure, retail was waiting for a pump and didn't get it, we're all battered, nothing feels real, or won... ..In some ways, this IS good news, all we need is stability, a new floor, and this year is ours. ..Tomorrow is a brighter day :)
8
Maybe it’s because the volume arrives when the markets open tomorrow morning in the US?

A bit blue after yesterday

That lady is the quintessential nanny state Karen and deserves ridicule.

It's not just ETHBTC, every alt is pumping HARD. So far it did more good for alts than for BTC itself.
5
No, they just think #2 will rise more.
4
I think it's more or less the market being forward-looking. ETF approval for coin 2 is now on the horizon, so time to rotate in order to obtain the benefits of a run-up
9
> Ethbtc ..lol zoom out.. look at the ratio back in the past
1
The daily candle looks the same as yesterday’s with the wicks tho, I wouldn’t call it a anticlimactic day.
5
>I've been doing it with 10-20 dollars at a time. That's why you are losing your porfolio. You're doing stupid things like 20x+ leverage and gambling your change. ..It's not worth it to margin trade unless you have $1k+. But you can only maximum leverage of 3x. You'll get liquidated much more rarely but now you see gains for a few hundred dollars instead of $10...Start off with $500 and 5x max but aim for 3x max. You have to enter your positions with lower margin. Stop losses are for when you add leverage while already in the profits.
4
I’ve been doing the same thing with bitty_bot. One of these days I am going to get my position there off the ground...Paper trading is the safe way to use leverage. You learn that even in ideal conditions you are more likely to fuck yourself up eventually. Seeing how badly you can fuck up is important.
8
Dude, you need to hodl for at least 36 months, watch the value of your stack grow, learn how the market works so that you can develop a strategy that is comfortable for your level of risk aversion.  Then and only then should you dip your toes in trading, and you should never risk more than you're willing to lose.
2
Why do people say this here. Alts running against Bitcoin means we are in a fucking bull market my dawg. ..See 2017.

this is another hack right?

Selling the news got priced in. New, old, money era starts tomorrow.

People are dumping Bitcoin proxies for the ETFs. Get out of MSTR and mining stocks while you can. COIN is probably ok.

Proxies are not being bought & sold/shorted, the money will flow to the spot ETFs tomorrow.

When is the flippening
4
Seriously, get a grip...Yesterday everyone was calling it the end of ETH, now it's trading at 0.052 BTC/ETH after a mere 4 % ratio pump. This is close to it's bottom.
5
I sold all of mine yesterday...After I sold it was lower, now it's higher, happy with the trade.
4
ETH is not a sh*tcoin.  It's the #1 altcoin  And yes, most other altcoins eventually lose 99%, but not all.

There is no way this is the yearly high. We may get a correction, but it will only be temporary.
11
I tend to agree...Folks aren't factoring in the currently *inflated* value.  We're not sitting on bedrock, we're up on the tenth floor.  Check the 3-month chart, people...Is Tesla going to change the world? Yes.  Is its stock value *fair*?  Fuck no, no way, not in a million years.  Can still go up, but it's inflated as hell.

Had he been "Bryan" with a "y", this might've been news.

It's simply everyone who positioned for selling the news into FOMO liquidity, closing positions into thin air instead...Leverage will exit the market and everyone will be rekt by the time the thing they were leveraging up to gamble on happens, as is always the case. No one ever gets a free ride, either the news sellers or the FOMO'ers.
6
/s right? All the new participants come after ATH. Happens every cycle. The only reason we ever get the ATH in the first place is exhausted sellers and a tiny handful of diamond hand buyers...The ETFs will sit untouched until 100k. Then everyone apes in.

?

It was 15 minutes till the 2nd tweet, unaware of time to deletion of the first one
9
It didn’t take inside of 3 minutes, why are you lying? You’re crazy if you think it makes sense for them to bald faced lie about something that is so easily proved to be a lie - especially when Elon, who isn’t a huge fan of the SEC, is the one that could prove it was a lie..
10
> The SEC tweet looked real legit. ..No. The image is clearly a very quick amateur job while the quote doesn't match the man.
5
I buy the hack but I don't buy that it was some nefarious stranger, the SEC is known for working and bowing down to large institutions, they're puppets.  I'm sure gary "accidentally turned off his two factor" and this "hack" wasn't a guy who just timed this a day before the announcement but an inside job.  For what? Not exactly sure, but there was a lot of money/pyschology/liquidations/sell buy opportunities involved in that 7% wick.
2
Don't they have to buy the Bitcoin first to sell?
6
There isn’t enough leverage to make a difference. If we’re going up higher then we have to have an infusion of cash.
8
Where's the executive order?
12
You’re not. Check your ego.
10
Generally respect what you post but really not sure what you are suggesting here. There's no executive order and this is still a wait and see. Forms get cancelled and refiled literally all the time, there's just never so much scrutiny.

Cboe filed for request of accelerated S-1 approval for all 6 ETF issuers (Fidelity, Franklin, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, ARK 21shares and WisdomTree.)..Let's see if Nasdaq and NYSE follow. It is expected if they want/need to launch tomorrow...edit: PS, this is the `Then see some "Correspondence letter" requesting SEC to approve S-1 asap.` part I [talked about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/191d2jx/daily_discussion_monday_january_08_2024/kgv3xq4/). But I would have expected it after the 19b-4 approval, so to me it just shows SEC told exchanges to file it now to ensure S-1 approval still happens today and all ETFs can launch at same time - tomorrow.
17
and I tell them, no, you're dumb.

Ha... no doubt. And part of that might be true, but I don't care. :)

Well, they could never ban bitcoin, but they could have blocked banks from allowing withdrawls to fiat. And even if you never planned on converting back to fiat, it would have effected BTC pricing.

I was already balls deep by that point. All I could do was hold on.

> like who is buying that shit? It's all garbage lol..It's driven by a narrative that bitcoin is only #1 because of first mover advantage and all it takes is a coin that is faster/cheaper than bitcoin to over take it.  It misses the major component of decentralization completely...When you are new to this space and have lots of greed/jealousy/regret from not buying bitcoin earlier, you get suckered into this altcoin narrative.

Idiots who think BTC is too expensive and they want to have a whole unit of something.

Great trade wp - was not an easy place to put your cash at the time.
3
The causality is not clear - it could be Blackrock only went for it because the odds were finally above threshold.
5
No need for he conspiracy theory on this one, the grayscale court case win was the start. But I've no doubt that when Blackrock got fully involved they were confident of what the outcome would be.

I've been in this space for 8 years and my dad has known about it since the beginning.  He's seen my 150x gains over the years...I've obviously joked with him about buying but he's an old school stock market dude.  I think this might be what pushes him to get in and get his toes wet when all he has to do is log into his broker and buy just like he does with stocks...No new account sign up, no recovery seeds, no worries.  Just point, click, buy, and it's right up there with all his other investments.

Some investors don’t want to hold coins and handle custody. They could sell spot to acquire an ETF IOU. That could explain a dip today until the ETFs start trading...Not sure how the mechanic works for the ETF acquisition of coins. I would assume they already bought a lot of coins to cover anticipated demand, but I have no idea

Very few people can predict the micro bro, you basically have to have connections none of us have.... that's why very few day traders make it long term... it's mostly gambling... but you can have success predicting the macro. That's why so many people hodl in a nutshell.

3
It's almost like there are no flows into ETFs outside of 9.30 a.m. - 4 p.m. Monday to Friday...Seriously, buying of bitcoin by the ETFs is pretty much directly linked to buying of the ETFs themselves.  There can be no inflows until the markets open...EDIT TO ADD: The seeding is pretty much exactly a float to lubricate the system. Flows won't start until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow - and even that assumes there is no delay in the start of trading.

4
All selling pressure from the 'sell the news crowd' (you know who you are) focuses on BTC. In retrospect, after so much powder was blown on 2 fake news events (Cointelegraph article, SEC twitter hack), it should have been expected that alts pump harder (lower liquidity, still catching up, hopes on ETH ETFs etc.). Again, in retrospect, trading the ratios would have been the most profitable play to accumulate BTC short-term. Unfortunately, there's no repeating here...Don't worry though, I expect volume to be good to great upon launch and capital will shift again. Expectations on volume vs. actual numbers will play a lesser role IMHO - any additional inflow is price positive, it's just a question of how much.
3
I'm also unsure. People have to take profit somewhere I guess. I don't think it's significant. We shouldn't be in any doubt about the benefits of the rulings. Hopefully we see the benefits sooner rather than later!

It's frustrating because you typically only get a few of these a cycle that are worth taking...It's a way to keep your underlying stack as it is and take a bit of profit without eroding your stack...The knock on effect here could be some "stack erosion" in the medium term.

Neh dont think so. Think that fake tweet screwed us a bit though.

Wondering the same thing, why not just wait a day and set a sell order above $48K?  I'm surprised anyone is selling this week.
4
> If an ETF approval is imminent, who in their right mind would be selling now?..There is no rule, or law, that says that once you sell BTC, you are unable to buy it back, for 24hrs...People who sold at $47k did the smart thing, and nowcan buy back at $45k, now.  People are selling at $45k right now, may be betting that they can buy back even more at $44.5k.  It's called "trading".

CBOE announced this listing earlier than they should and are now withdrawing that order. That’s the gist of it. ..Does not mean the SEC is delaying or denying the ETFs. ..Just from what I’m reading.
10
Withdrawing one form doesn't mean that they have withdrawn. They can be refiled. They may have already been refiled. It's still a wait and see.
5
Cancel and refiling of SEC forms happens literally _all_ the time. EDGAR has amendment versions of most of their forms.

They know there are still lots of weak hands. Flip em over and shake the coin from their pockets.

it would fit the wild timeline

I’m guessing this is there the higher volume/meh PA is coming from. For everyone buying the news some are selling to get back on the ETF tomorrow...Not everyone wants custody and it’s OK.

it has already been pulled though, so it's currently on the sidelines.

I personally don’t fuck around and am a “time in the market” guy. ..Pulling the trigger on mstr at 160 and coin at 40 last year as soon as I could rather than waiting for lower (which I could have theoretically gotten if I timed it perfect) resulted in a 4x gain. ..With this etf, plus the halving, my bet is btc is going to be way higher than 50k in a year, and I enjoy sleeping easy at night in cold storage and my Roth
3
And daily
4
By my math like 1% discount. At end of trading gbtc 40.5. Nav for the price it was around that time (45,500) would be 40.95. So it’s basically fully closed just by the market
1
thx.. I did not know about that one...The power of Bitcoin Blockchain at work.
2
Well, one theory goes that the hacker then noticed there was a schedueled post, which was even better than posting something silly.
6
The thing whipsawed so hard it was a sight. Didn't move much at first. Looks like we might be getting legs tho
1
Yeah that was my biggest surprise, I thought someone would immediately arbitrage the discount out since the discount is about to go to zero.
3
It’s the best trade for the next 5 minutes.

Fuck.. tried to buy a bunch of gbtc but my orders didn’t execute ughhh

They are on Nasdaq. For some reason Cboe has been filing things in public today but NYSE/Nasdaq not (yet.)

AFAIK Blackrock is not on CBOE but ~~NYSE~~ Nasdaq instead.

5
That was actually good bad advice! Your name is spot on when you engage with me mate
1
Exactly. It's an internal communications issue. Imagine the lawsuit shit show if the SEC decided to postpone things due to their own mistake... it would incur hundreds of millions of dollars of damages for the issuers. Absolutely not going to happen. Could be a rejection anyway of course, although unlikely, but to think that this mishap would affect the process in any way is just not plausible imo.

9:30am EST, source is somewhere in this thread
1
Well, we have had that before. And the first source of the link was this Twitter guy phoenixtrades_ who has said he has a bot that allows him to get links to new files in their server. He hasn’t revealed the method but there are 2-3 others. ..Also as other evidence, the CBOE withdrawals are still currently invisible on the SEC website, they were found through this link method.
2
No, SEC uploads the files first. Announces it later. But bots can fetch the links to them. ..It’s basically uploading to the FTP server but not linking it anywhere...If you know CAP theorem, you’d know you can upload files to the server without them being linked anywhere on the .htmls or whatever. But their file hierarchy is accidentally public due to bad tech backend...Also CAP is relevant for transactional databases and equivalent, not really relevant for static web pages.
1
Bots.. its mostly bots
3
Remember Donald Trump’s anti-BTC tweet when he was president?..It read similarly… not a hack, but DEFINITELY not written by him.  Way too articulate and nuanced, it was so odd.
8
FYI Early SEC tweets from years ago they used that same bitcoin hash tag and symbols
4
And then there’s people like Saylor who have no target sell price. They’re in it for the long haul and they’re persistent buyers regardless of price. More of these diamond hands are being created over time, not less...Combine that with absolute scarcity and price can go really high really fast with a relatively small amount of incoming capital. Hence a large bull market multiple.
12
Very good observation

Uff, that will be an agonising day. :(
8
oh only those 2 are implicit today? ..That actually seems like they're more likely to make an actual announcement then that approves all the others explicitly?
6
I think this is incorrect. In this case an explicit approval needs to happen. I read this before.
6
so essentially silence until the market closes = etf approved?
5
Absolutely. I think we will see a spike in Jan next year when the boomers etc do their annual portfolio rebalancing. They will see these funds that have great returns on the year-end, and it will “suddenly” grab their attention. Or they will have advisors recommend rebalancing into Bitcoin a small percentage, and they will agree because of the 2024 annual performance of the ETF.
3
wait, what abuse, we were just foreplaying with him.
5
Really fishy that they are keeping their fees @ 1.5% in the face of all their competition being so much lower.

Yep, definitely in the denial phase.

“So how does it work? A bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that buys and holds the actual cryptocurrency. The price of the ETF is linked to the underlying bitcoin held in the fund. The issuer lists the ETF on a traditional stock exchange and investors trade the asset just like any other security.”

Nope. Doesn’t matter.

34 votes in so far.  1 vote for $55K+, about half think $47.5K - $50K.  The other half are evenly split between $50K - $52.5K and under $47.5K.
3
the dump started before fake Gary's fake tweet, and kind of reversed to a spike for a minute there in the chaos.  bots and algos and HFT farms move quickly; it's possible that many of the sellers already sold.

We only had about 1-2 minutes of real reaction time. The rest was manipulated because it was a fake announcement. Close your leveraged short

Right and the whole court case was based on just 2 BTC futures ETFs (not Bito!) because they did approve 19b-4 for these 2. And they didn't yet for ETH futures ETFs.

Aye thanks only other thing I could think of was makr or something. He’s already talking about options I may have made a mistake
1
100%..dYdX > deribit..I simply do not trust an off-shore exchange (based in Panama, no less) with my funds..especially not after FTX
3
Then you're trusting the holder of wbtc. No way I'll ever swap my btc for fake ones.

But isn’t it unlikely that the multiplier for incoming cash will stay a around 100-150?..IMO we will see here diminishing returns. No way 170 billion will send us to 1 million.

You can't compare 1B of inflows to 3B of volume at all. It's apples to oranges...

..idk how else to interpret the tweet tho   ."On the Price multiplier effect for #Bitcoin, we can look at how much capital flows into the Realized Cap per unit change in Market cap.....We estimate a multiplier effect of around 4-5x by this model using on-chain data."  .  .  .Framing it in terms of 2 MSTR tho does make it seem low though.

"I'm open to the idea of using #Bitcoin on X" - Musk..To be fair he does have some Bitcoin to sell still. I expect him to turn heel after he dumps that.

> This is coming from the guy who just turned off half of twitter without understanding what it did first?..Scream testing is a valid strategy. Don't know what something does? Turn it off and see who pops up complaining. I bet half the shit he turned off they never turned back on because it was unnecessary bs.

Yes sorry. There was another which was dated in July, not this but that seems to be an error

You don't think any pension funds will pick up a few shares?

I think we might get an ETF announcement wick back up to 46K-46.9K and then dump down to 42K.  This was never really looking good with ETH/BTC ratio going up like crazy.
5
Copy-paste from last withdrawal, maybe. See second letter, it has correct date.
9
That's what's confusing me. Weird initial date, but the body mentions Jan 10, 2024
7
The thing I like is it is actually here so all the guessing will be over

Estimates are that up to 6M are lost, so 15M are more likely actually available.

It enhances the comedic aspect when you're picturing the scenario above in your head. 🙃

LTC doesn’t have futures though? I think coin number 2 will be next since it has futures already

Approval today means the ETFs open to market tomorrow? I legit didn't know it was that fast I assumed they'd need some time to get listed.

Well they certainly won't lead to LESS buying pressure.

No fanfare, business as usual, zero tweeting, everyone happy.
3
Its blatant market manipulation. There should not be chatter on social media from SEC or Gary Gensler.
2
And then their Twitter page and website will have conflicting information. I assume they either delete thr tweet saying no approval or issue a new tweet.

btc has gone up a lot previously even at the hint of something happening , like even very small rumors   .and right now what we see in front of us is a  REAL BIG event..hell , bitcoin moves up 10 percent some days just without any news.

bitcoin is 24/7 and anyone involved in it doesnt sleep so this doesnt matter
-7
Lol.

Why would eth have an etf when it is bout to be classified as a security
2
Yeah, long way to go before we hit 0.17.
1
What's all this stuff about dollars?  Trade for more sats, not more dollars.
3
Because nothing good has ever happened with Bitcoin dominance going below 40. Ever. And why would this time be different?..Not there yet obviously but it's something to keep an eye on. When the shitcoin frenzy starts for real you know the writing is on the wall. Or do you truly think altseason s are sustainable?
1
Yea its just crypto money swirling around until the flows start.
7
Miners are safe. A BTC etf doesn't provide nearly enough leverage for degens, WSB will still be aping into the microminers
1
ETF means more profits for miners, after all mining is a business. Mining stock should go up as profit soars.
1
I own native btc in cold storage.  Not looking to add more to it...My IRA is a very small % of my net worth from a long ago previous job so decided to at least expose it to bitcoin as otherwise it was just sitting there barely making anything.
1
Zoomlish I think.
3
I agree I think its just a pause for now but I like it better when ethbtc doesn't rip13% in an hour  from .047 to  .053.
2
If you truly believe that ETHBTC bottomed here then historically we can expect a 400-1200% ratio rally over the next six months. So ETHBTC to .2-.4 lol by the halving?!?!..Id like to see it between .02-.03 personally but I think it will prob bottom in the .03-.04 range
2
.047 to .054 is an almost 15% pump, not 4%..If this is the bottom for ETHBTC that's pretty bearish imo. BTC rallied from 15k to 48k while outperforming ethereun and the altcoin market. I personally don't see how Bitcoin will outperform the market if what you say is correct and we are now in altseason (ETHBTC making new highs). ..And after altseason, the market ALWAYS takes a dump . So if you really think ETHBTC bottomed just now, you'd have to think we are within 6ish months to the cycle peak. Last time ETHBTC bottomed in December 2020 and topped in April 2021...How long do you think this rally can sustain itself with ethereun and altcoins leading the charge? That never has worked out, historically alt season (by definition, almost) necessarily implies unsustainable gains...For the long-term health of this rally I really hope we see Bitcoin continue to grind down the shitcoin ratios. ETHBTC bottoming out 3 months before the halving means we are way way way ahead of schedule and the top is closer than we think imo...
4
Yet again the ETHBTC blowoff marks the BTCUSD top. How many tops have we seen this? I can't think of a BTC top that didn't end in with ETHBTC blowing off, tbh. Can you?
2
Sold your BTC or eth?
2
Why are you so confident?
1
we will see.. This will bring unimaginable wealth. I m not so sure about its initial purpose, independent banking.

yikes

Yes they do, that's the whole point of coinmarketcap.com.  How could you possibly invest in a coin without knowing its market cap?..Professional investors (myself included) are even more tuned in to market cap.
3
When the SECGov twitter password was changed, Gensler forgot to write it down on a Post-It Note and tape it to his monitor. Now he can't tweet. 😉
7
it's more of an assumed approval relative to bloomberg terminal listing all the ETFs as "pending" and CBOE site claims ARKB, FBTC, and HODL are expected to start trading tomorrow
4
Everyone is so euphoric and I think the price is down only from here unless we get a giga pump this month

All the cash that flowed out of MSTR, COIN and mining stocks (and perhaps some significant amount of on-exchange coins too) this week to switch to an ETF is still waiting to buy the ETFs - it's all coming back after they launch.
7
You’re doing the lords work 🙏🏼
6
At this point, besides the final nod, it's pretty much all systems go.  I'm wondering what news there is left to sell at this point?  I'm calling it now, there is going to be some declaration of a "rug pull" on bears who "sold the news" and got rekt.
5
the bitcoin price isn't a random event, it's a consequence of supply and demand. And your decision to hodl every day, through ups and downs, is also intentional not random.

Actually I’m pretty proud - basically the entire thing knocked 1k off the price, no biggie…

What's the end game here it keeps ratcheting up to 100k/500k/1M/5M/20M/100M? At some point sats become so valuable that the cost of moving sats will be too expensive. What happens then?   .The more that HODL the higher the price which then incentivizes selling which drops the price. To play devil's advocate: How is this not a greater fools theory/ponzi/tulip mania?   ...We'd have to suck up all the worlds capital and deflate the price of everything won't that hurt non bitcoiners to the point they revolt?  .There are likely more non btc holders than BTC holders so wouldn't we get outvoted?

If I’m not mistaken, if they want to approve the others they have to say so.
7
 They silently approved ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF).
6
I believe you are correct, and it has to do with the futures ETFs being filed under the 1940 act, and spot under 1933. But there are multiple people here incorrectly stating that the SEC doesn’t need to say anything to approve
1
Only for Ark, because the deadline for Ark is today.  If they want to approve all (or at least more than just Ark) simultaneously, then they will have to say something.

You can now edit SL and TP with the `edit` command...`edit sl 45000 tp 46000`..just `edit` or `edit none` will remove any existing SL or TP. ..If you have a SL and a TP set for example, and you only do `edit sl 45000` it will set your SL to $45,000 and WILL REMOVE YOUR TP. ..Updating the documentation now, but wanted to let you know first since you asked about it last night and I added it to my TODO list.
2
Correct. I’m sure there is some way I could do a calculation so that your exposure remains the same to the time that you added the SL or TP (not at the moment you opened the trade)..Or I could just add commands to add sl and tp

In reality, market makers in conventional stocks tend not to fully hedge much of the time - at least during bull markets. So they do have an exposure.  They will (should) be managing that risk, though.

The rumour that the sell the news action will happen tomorrow.
1
For the first class of investor (think seed basket buyer), yes.  For joe blow retail we are just trading shares back and forth, so no.
5
It’s cash settled, so they pay sellers of shares in USD. I cannot say with certainty but am guessing the firms offering these ETF’s can pay that USD from multiple sources: A. from the fees buyers have paid for shares B. from the incoming USD from new buyers of shares C. selling their held Bitcoin…the one thing they’ll have to prove is that their shares are backed by matching amounts of Bitcoin. (I’m not even close to an expert on this matter, though.)
3
Well, not if there are other buyers buying shares on the open market. Meaning if you wanted to sell five shares and I wanted to buy five shares then we just trade it between us over Nasdaq. But if the price of the ETF is out of sync with Bitcoin the authorized participants will market make. So if there is excessive selling pressure on ETF shares these firms would sell off real Bitcoin on Coinbase to redeem the ETF shares.

I've heard this multiplier given as 5x by some Treasury Department paper a good while back. Fairly sure that was in bullish weather too...100x feels like it must have been measured during an excessive slippy period of low liquidity.
10
I think that largely depends on the price dynamic. I assume the amount of sellers will be inversely proportional to how aggressively and steadily the price will be rising over time, leading to higher top.

It's the premium being erased as there's about to be other options for people to have BTC exposure. Apart from if you are in tax sheltered UK investments (sadface).

You are right,  .Analysts can \*try\* to estimate future price based on metrics, yet prices only move on narratives .

Well..there are exceptions to every rule.  Just trying to make the point that people should be careful trying to equate the ETF to stocks or stock ETFs.

nope. 21M.

Theoretically GBTC sells off as big holders take their gains from the discount closing. ..Theoretically not a great deal goes into the ETFs, leading to people who had bought expecting a massive run selling...It's possible!..I don't think that myself but it's possible

Yes, even relatively  small inflows will push the price up. If you're not sure, wait and see, but selling now makes little sense to me.

This guy emphasizes ;)
1
If they don't want a spot ETF, there's also BITX for 2x leverage with far less counterparty risk. As more of these leveraged paper and spot products are developed, the use of miners as leveraged plays is gunna decrease. It's only a matter of time.
1
Mining is a hard business. Their reward is about to get cut in half, there's increasing competition, and operating costs are high. They hold Bitcoin and it's value will increase, so that's good, but they could also go out of business any minute for any number of reasons. They're still companies and have a lot of risk. Now with ETFs, there's a less risky way to get Bitcoin exposure, which will be more attractive to people who are investing on behalf of funds and pensions, etc.
1
Eth, cleared it out. It has re-made everything I lost on Bitmex (edit: in BTC terms), as was the goal. ;)
2
Because if people buy the etf, the etf has to buy coin. There is only a limited amount of coin. You cannot price in demand which does not yet exist.

I just made a coin called TCS (this coin sucks). It’s pre mined. I gave some to a few of my buddies. There’s 10 billion units of TCS. Priced at 1 dollar a piece. Market cap is now 10 billion dollars.

The tulip bubble lasted like two years.  BTC came out in 2008.
6
Sats that can’t be moved because transaction costs are too high are sats that can’t be sold. They need to already be on an exchange or in a layer 2 like Lightning network before transaction costs get too high otherwise those are effectively sats lost forever...Tulips weren’t absolutely scarce nor digitally transmittable globally in a permissionless way. BTC has actual real world value in a world where fiat currency is printed into infinity and requires permission from centralized entities to move around large amounts globally...The masses can revolt if they’d like and they can even pass laws to ban BTC. However, passing a law isn’t the same thing as actually being able to enforce that law on a globally decentralized network. You could theoretically pass a law banning gravity if you had enough support but that doesn’t mean you can actually enforce it...Hyperbitcoinization is inevitable. You either realize it now and convert as much fiat to BTC as possible before it happens or you wait until you live in a world where the only way to acquire BTC is in exchange for goods/services which have real world value. Most will end up falling into the latter because most people are reactive rather than proactive.

> There are likely more non btc holders than BTC holders so wouldn't we get outvoted?...LMFAO
6
> How is this not a greater fools theory/ponzi/tulip mania? ..Because the goal is not to obtain dollars.  The goal is to obtain Bitcoin.  Why would anyone want to hold dollars in a world where Bitcoin exists?  Yes, dollars are a unit of exchange (for now) so we have to grudgingly sell Bitcoin at a huge profit after a few years of hodling, but we sell as little as we need to.  ..This is nothing like Tulip mania which by most historical accounts only lasted a year or so...> We'd have to suck up all the worlds capital and deflate the price of everything won't that hurt non bitcoiners to the point they revolt?..We'd become all the world's capital, and no-coiners can go fuck themselves or get to work cleaning our pools for a few sats.  After all the shit I put up with trying to convince people to at least allocate a small portion of their portfolios to BTC, I will very much enjoy watching them become my pool boys and girls...The fiat game is coming to an end.  Bitcoin is the natural successor.  Eventually (talking decades from now) everything will be priced in sats all around the world.

I'm dumping my GBTC as soon as the discount dissipates. I think it got to about 2.5% today. I wonder if that is part of their strategy as well.

Hell yea! Much appreciated and very necessary 👍

[Derived from this Bloomberg article published back in March 2021](https://archive.is/sejEZ) in the midst of the last bull market. Gold was included as a reference...High bull market multiple has to do with HODL rate and how much price needs to increase in order to convince HODLers to sell that otherwise wouldn’t. Over time, more and more BTC finds its “forever home” into diamond hands who refuse to sell while at the same time rate at which new BTC is mined cuts in half every 4 years.

Where are people pulling these multipliers from? And don't they decrease as the price increases?

Ah maybe I misunderstood. I thought 6-8 was a correction from the 4-6 timeslot. A bit confusing from those tweets
3
I can confirm
1
Even in your scenario, the ETF approval doesn't lower buy pressure, that was simply my point.  I think we all expect/assume the ETF approval significantly increases the buy pressure but even in a worst case scenario it wouldn't lower it...Certainly your scenario creates a variable that would increase sell pressure temporarily.

Mining is always most profitable after halving. Go check mining equipment prices in the last 2 cycles. The static way of calculating number of corn for mining profitability is just wrong. I agree with your other points though, miners can bankrupt.

Congrats, nice trade.
2
Yup, add to that the halving in april and you have all the ingredients for a giant ~~bubble~~ wave of adoption.

This concept is lost on so many people trying to draw parallels between this and the futures ETF launch. So few coins available at this price level and ownership is way stickier than any other type of financial asset meaning as price goes up people are less willing to part ways with it versus say a stock of similar performance.
5
They already bought coin. People can sell the ETF too lol.
0
Obviously it does not. Imo the asset feels compromised
1
This is exactly why it does work - if traded on a liquid exchange that shit coin goes from 10bil to 10mil...Your example is way out of context of btc and stock/commodity market caps anyway
3
Adding to that—amongst my TradFi only trading friends, many want to give it a week due to expecting the ETF’s to megapump and then pullback. Their thinking is based on IPO launches, though, so it’s potentially flawed. They’ll still buy, so hopefully we catch some sustained inflows for a couple of weeks. I’ve told them to at least ladder in.

It’d be an appropriate meme birthed from this cycle.

I am happily incorrect :)

Dude if you buy the etf from Blackrock or whatever how do you think you get your coins?!

!bitty_bot long max 100x

It's good to have one come off, especially long-term spot trade. Does feel good to close it.
1
It's not even available to trade. They have seeded. Any share of the etf created tomorrow leads to more BTC bought...The seeders are not going to sell on the day of public launch...The question is whether there is the buying demand that people expect. I'm not sure yet
6
They bought their seed only. They will have more orders than what their seed will cover. Plus, halving is in April. That alone will be a tailwind for the price to rise without and ETF.

There isn’t liquidity for most of these pump and dumps. Which is why the metric is silly. During the ICO era we had new projects popping up every month that were pure nonsense. And all they did was bleed the dominance. But they aren’t anything of substance. ..I digress, the example I used is more illustrative of why the BTC dominance metric is useless, and not so much market cap.

Thanks. And does this rate decrease as price (and market cap) increases?

It has more to do with HODL rate than price/market cap. As HODL rate increases, multiplier increases and vice versa...As price increases you would expect HODL rate to decrease but for the past year even though price more than doubled, HODL rate increased as well and reached a new ATH even though price has not yet reached new ATH. This indicates as time passes more and more BTC is entering possession of strong hands who aren’t interested in selling. At the same time, new supply being mined is cutting in half every 4 years...Miners are natural sellers because they have costs they need to cover. Right now 900 new BTC are mined per day. Hypothetically, suppose HODL rate is at 100% and the only sellers are miners. If $1 billion were to come in on that day to buy the 900 BTC available for sale, price would need to rise to over $1 million immediately to satisfy the demand...In reality miners aren’t the only sellers, there’s other sellers on any given day. But the higher the HODL rate, the higher the multiplier ends up being.
