tldr; Despite a bearish trend in Ethereum's price, the network saw significant growth with 126,210 new wallets created on a typically quiet Sunday. This surge in network activity contrasts with the price struggle, as Ethereum faces selling pressure and risks falling below key support levels. However, the increase in network utility and whale activity, including a significant purchase by a known whale, suggests potential for a price rebound. Amidst this, Ethereum's price remains under pressure, with bearish market sentiment and potential for further declines if key support levels are not maintained...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Ethereum has experienced a 6% drop as gas fees have plummeted, raising questions about whether ETH bears will push the price below the $2,000 mark. Despite initial optimism from the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, outflows have negated any gains, and the momentum from May is fading. The current local support is around $2,000, and sellers are dominating the market. The average trading volume has also seen a contraction, now around $12 billion. Amidst this downturn, concerns are rising about the long-term security of the Ethereum network due to falling mainnet revenue and decreasing layer-2 fees...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Vice President Kamala Harris has remained silent on cryptocurrency policy, despite efforts by the group Crypto4Harris to garner her support for the sector. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is positioning himself as a pro-crypto candidate, promising to make the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency if re-elected. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has shifted legislative priorities towards artificial intelligence, leaving cryptocurrency legislation off his priority list. This shift and Harris' silence on crypto have raised concerns in the cryptocurrency community, despite some industry support for Harris...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; BBVA, a Spanish multinational banking giant, has introduced Circle’s USDC stablecoin for its institutional and private banking clients in Switzerland. This service allows clients to manage USDC alongside traditional investments on the same platform, facilitating exchanges, custody, and conversion of USDC into euros, U.S. dollars, or other currencies for quicker transactions. This addition aims to enhance efficiency for institutional clients, such as investment fund managers, who use stablecoins for trading cryptocurrencies across various exchanges.

tldr; Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a bearish trend with its lowest weekly close since early February at about $2,294. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that Ethereum whales have reduced their accumulation rate since early July, leading to a net cash outflow of approximately $568 million from US-based spot Ether ETFs. Despite this, the Ethereum network has seen growth, with a four-month high in network growth and over 126k new wallets created, suggesting a potential bullish rebound. However, if Ether's price consistently closes below the support rising trendline, further bearish sentiment could push the price below $2k...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; An anonymous crypto whale purchased 5,000 ETH, worth approximately $11.46 million, signaling a strategic investment in the Ethereum market. This is not the whale's first significant move; in November 2022, they bought 5,200 ETH and later sold them for over $4 million in profit. The whale's actions, known for their strategic timing, suggest confidence in Ethereum's future potential despite current market conditions. The market has shown a minimal but upward reaction to this purchase, with Ethereum's price slightly increasing...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; A McKinsey & Co report predicts the tokenized real world asset (RWA) sector could reach $4 trillion by 2030, driven by the digital representation of physical assets like real estate, precious metals, and artwork on public blockchains. Major financial institutions are leading the way, with the RWA sector showing significant growth. The industry is attracting both institutional and retail investors due to its risk-adjusted high yield products based on sound fundamentals.

tldr; Recent data from Glassnode shows Ethereum's exchange reserves are at a critical low, similar to levels seen in 2016. This situation in 2016 was followed by a significant price rally in 2017. The current low reserves and increasing velocity of ETH transfers could indicate a potential for a similar upward trend. However, current market conditions and technical indicators suggest Ethereum may face further challenges before any substantial price increase. The historical pattern raises questions about whether ETH will experience a similar resurgence, but bearish sentiment and technical analysis indicate possible further declines in the short term...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized.

This is the concept Marx and Engels refer to as the "labor aristocracy," that period of time where capitalism is more benevolent, offering higher wages due to labor shortages after a major pandemic or war.  It makes people falsely believe the system works if only you work hard enough (okay boomer, thanks for the downvotes in advance).  Of course capitalism breaks this promise as soon as economic conditions recover.  It's the boom and bust cycle that this sub loves to trade on.

tldr; Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is facing significant challenges including price concerns, declining network activity, and interoperability issues. Crypto strategist Justin Bennett predicts a potential 69% price drop for Ethereum to $700. Factors contributing to Ethereum's struggles include declining transaction fees, inflationary supply dynamics, and decreased transaction count compared to Bitcoin. Despite market downturns, Ethereum's decentralized exchanges (DEX) have shown resilience with an 18% volume increase. However, interoperability issues pose a significant hurdle, with no universal standard for asset movement across platforms. These challenges come amid a difficult week for the crypto market, with a total market cap drop below $2 trillion...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Crypto firm’s CEO resigns after being robbed of company funds at gunpoint
15
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fci5rx)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: OP Crypto Set To Rise Gains As Key Indicators Point To an Uptrend
13
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fci3ip)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; OP Crypto, a Layer-2 network built on the Ethereum blockchain, has shown significant bullish signals, with its price increasing by over 15% in the last week. Key indicators such as a positive divergence, a rise above the 20-day EMA, and a bullish divergence pattern on the RSI suggest a potential uptrend. The token has formed a triple bottom pattern near the $1.20 mark, indicating a possible trend reversal. With a current trading price of $1.43 and a market cap of $305.97 million, OP Crypto is poised for further gains, especially if it closes above the $1.70 mark, validating the breakout of the triple bottom pattern...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: 3 Things That Could Influence Crypto Markets This Week
8
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fci2ll)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; This week is crucial for crypto markets with key economic data releases ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The focus is on inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports due Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. These reports are significant as they influence Fed policy decisions. Additionally, jobless claims data will provide insights into the labor market. The outcome of these reports, especially the CPI, could affect the odds of a rate cut at the upcoming Fed meeting, potentially impacting crypto markets...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Vitalik Buterin Responds to Rumored Sales, Reaffirms Commitment to Ethereum and Charitable Causes

[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fcho7b)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: Friend.tech token drops 26% after team shirks control of smart contracts
7
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fchboe)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: What Are dApps? How They Differ From Traditional Apps

[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fch7lc)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Hello. You are receiving this message either because you don't have enough age/karma or because your command is not formatted properly. ..* If the former, you need a minimum of 1 month account age and 100 comment karma to flair submissions. ..* If the latter, you probably didn't capitalize the first letter or used a slightly different variation of spacing/spelling/punctuation. For example, if you want to flair a submission with *News* flair, use *News* instead of *news*. See here: `[AutoMod] News`. **TLDR:** Flair names are case-sensitive. At the current time, the acceptable post flairs are: Comedy, Discussion, Meta & Donut, News, Sentiment, Trading, Media and Self Story...If certain flair commands are formatted correctly but do not work, please [inform the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fethtrader)....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Title: Crypto ownership isn’t rising with recent market growth, Fed survey claims

[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fcgx8o)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: Ethereum Price Recovery May Stall Near 100-SMA: Is a Drop Coming?
8
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fcgjdl)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Ethereum (ETH) is attempting a recovery, having moved above $2,280 after testing the $2,150 support zone. It faces resistance near $2,360, which it must clear to continue its recovery. Failure to surpass this could lead to another decline, with major support at $2,180. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with the MACD losing bearish momentum and the RSI above 50, suggesting potential for either direction...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Early Ethereum adviser sues law firm for $100M over crypto extortion case defense
8
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fcggwy)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: Asset Tokenization Could Awaken A Coming-Of-Age For Investors
17
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fcga2o)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; A McKinsey & Co report predicts the tokenized real world asset (RWA) sector could reach $4 trillion by 2030, driven by the digital representation of physical assets like real estate, precious metals, and artwork on public blockchains. Major financial institutions are leading the way, with the RWA sector showing significant growth. The industry is attracting both institutional and retail investors due to its risk-adjusted high yield products based on sound fundamentals. Despite its potential, the RWA industry's growth depends on various factors, including market stability and investor education on the benefits of tokenized assets...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Stupid idiotic post. Ethereum is not down due to interoperability. Ethereum’s value is based on usage of its network, which is based on Dapp usage. Right now one can no longer create dapps because creating your own token has become illegal by persecution in America by Gary Gensler. Ethereum is down because ultimately Gary Gensler and the Biden Administration has reinforced strict illegal restrictions on crypto to kill the crypto industry

Think about it. Is it possible that land will become RWA tokenized at some point? Would it be the public or private sector tokenizing and selling it?..Imagine investing in some ERC20 tokenized land in some not so developed area vs some highly developed one. This would allow anyone from anywhere to easily invest in land everywhere. Crazy right?..Thoughts?

[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fccml2)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

i think after rate cut & during the election hype eth will rise not fall, & even f there is a small chance he is right that eth will fall it's very difficult to fall more than 30-40% of the current price. non serious prediction probably he is just looking for fame with strange predictions..!tip 1

70% collapse is always possible considering it’s crypto though I’d say that’s too bearish a base case is like another 30-40% if we think there is a downturn

Time for a POL dump ..!tip 1

Just wanted to comment I didn’t do anything with native matic token and now is Pol - everything good 👍 post migration

Looking forwards to see how it develops...!tip 1

tldr; The Polygon network has officially transitioned from using MATIC to POL as its native gas token. This change is part of a broader upgrade aimed at enhancing Polygon's interoperability and efficiency across its Proof of Stake (PoS) network. Users holding MATIC on Ethereum can migrate to POL on a 1:1 basis through the Polygon Portal interface. This migration is a key step in Polygon's evolution into an aggregated blockchain network, known as the AggLayer, which aims to unify liquidity and state across multiple chains. The upgrade to POL is designed to be backward compatible, ensuring a smooth transition for users, validators, and developers. The initial phase sees POL replacing MATIC as the native gas and staking token, with future phases expanding POL's utility across the network. The upgrade also introduces a tokenomics change, with a 2% emission over a decade to support network security and community development...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; The Ethereum community is experiencing mixed signals regarding ETH's value and roadmap, with divergent views from its leadership. Justin Drake compared ETH to Nvidia and Apple, suggesting it could reach multi-trillion valuations based on fees. However, Sam Kazemian of Frax Finance criticized this comparison, arguing it limits ETH's growth potential compared to Bitcoin and is a flawed way to gauge its value. The debate extends to Ethereum's DeFi vision, with leaders like Vitalik Buterin skeptical of DeFi as the sole growth catalyst, contrasting with others who see it as critical. This has led to confusion among investors and a decline in ETH's market sentiment, especially as ETH's fees have dropped and the community debates fee adjustments post-Dencun upgrade. Consequently, ETH has underperformed compared to BTC, losing 44% in value relative to BTC over the past two years...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

It looks like OP posted an AMP link.

tldr; Crypto stakeholders' lobbying expenses in the U.S. have surged by 1,386% from 2017 to 2024, with Coinbase leading the charge. Coinbase's lobbying budget increased by 3,475%, from $80,000 in 2017 to about $2.9 million in 2023, with 74% of this increase occurring in the last two years. Binance U.S. and Ripple also significantly increased their lobbying expenditures. This rise in lobbying efforts is seen as a strategic response to regulatory policies, particularly from the SEC, as companies like Coinbase seek to secure a favorable regulatory environment for future growth...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; BlackRock has emerged as the only major ETF to recently purchase Ethereum, holding 336,058 ETH valued at $763.95 million. This development occurs amid a challenging period for Ethereum ETFs, which have experienced nearly $480 million in outflows within their first 30 days. Ethereum's value has slightly declined by 0.54% since the year's start, contrasting with gains in Bitcoin and Solana. The performance of Ethereum ETFs has been influenced by factors such as the unlocking of Grayscale's Ethereum Trust, leading to significant outflows...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Not surprisingly. ..Eth's two main utility is 1) gas for network (L1/L2) and 2) staking token for securing the ethereum network..Gas fees are super cheap/low now as traffic has moved to L2 as planned. ETH ETFs got nerfed with staking removed. Without staking rewards incentive and poor price action, what is the incentive for main street investors to go for ETH ETF and not BTC ETF?..The parallel for ETH ETF in wall street would be dividend stocks if staking rewards were activated...What if they launch say, LSD ETF, like say rETH or stETH ETF instead? Would that work without getting SEC all batshit crazy?

Title: Crypto Markets Forming Huge Bear Trap Before Ascent Into Euphoria, According to Crypto Analyst
11
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fc1dif)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; The article discusses the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in response to inflation, considering its dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum employment. It argues that while the Fed may have been late in tightening monetary policy from an inflation standpoint, it's not fair to label it a mistake without considering the employment aspect.

It concludes by emphasizing the complexity of monetary policy decisions and the trade-offs between controlling inflation and maintaining low unemployment rates...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Ethereum decentralized exchanges (DEX) saw an 18% increase in volume to $9.88 billion, contrasting with declines in other chains like Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Uniswap's volume rose by 14.2% to $5.7 billion following a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Other Ethereum DEX networks like Curve Finance, Balancer, Hashflow, and Pendle also experienced significant volume increases. This surge in DEX activity occurred during a week when the broader crypto market saw declines, with Bitcoin and Ethereum's prices dropping significantly...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Bybit and Binance have received full authorization from the Astana Financial Services Authority to operate as regulated Digital Asset Trading Facilities in Kazakhstan. This marks a significant step in their global expansion and solidifies Kazakhstan's position as a rising crypto powerhouse in the CIS region. Both exchanges underwent rigorous compliance procedures, including AML processes and external audits, to secure their licenses. This development is expected to boost the adoption of digital assets in Kazakhstan, offering services like custody and trading of virtual assets, and enhancing the country's status in the global cryptocurrency market...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: 1.9 Billion Shiba Inu in 24 Hours: SHIB Whales Making Comeback
15
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbz64l)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; In the last 24 hours, there has been a significant surge in Shiba Inu (SHIB) transactions, with 1.9 trillion SHIB moved, indicating a potential comeback of SHIB whales. This activity, marked by 98 large transactions, suggests a growing interest from major holders and could signal a change in market perception towards SHIB. The increase in whale activity and on-chain volume may hint at accumulation or preparation for liquidity events, despite SHIB trading below key moving averages. The token's presence in the oversold zone suggests a possible price reversal ahead...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

tldr; The article discusses key events in September that could impact the struggling cryptocurrency market. These include a debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, which is generating interest due to their stances on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for August and the Producer Price Index (PPI) report, along with the Initial Jobless Claims report, are anticipated. These events could influence economic decisions and affect both traditional and cryptocurrency markets by providing insights into inflation, economic health, and potential Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: RWA Sector Continues Expansion, Led by Usual Money, Hashnote & Ondo
13
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbyesm)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; The real-world asset (RWA) sector in decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing significant growth, led by Usual Money, Hashnote, and Ondo. The total value locked (TVL) in the sector reached a record $6.6 billion before correcting to $5.75 billion. Usual Money, a decentralized fiat-backed stablecoin issuer, saw its TVL reach $222.5 million, marking a 50% increase over the past month. Hashnote surpassed $250 million in TVL, and Ondo reached a new record of $600 million in TVL. These projects are contributing to the expansion of the RWA sector in DeFi...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

tldr; Coinbase achieved a partial win in its legal battle with the SEC, as a federal court ordered the SEC to provide documents related to its classification of crypto tokens as securities. This decision is part of an ongoing dispute since the SEC accused Coinbase of operating without proper registration. The court's order focuses on the discovery of documents that could clarify the SEC's application of securities laws to digital assets, although it did not fully grant all of Coinbase's requests for information...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Chainlink (LINK) has seen moderate gains after a period of decline, with analysts predicting a potential surge to $22. Currently trading at $10.23, LINK has to maintain above the $12 resistance level and fulfill certain conditions, including staying above the $6 support level and breaking out from a falling wedge pattern, to achieve this target. The positive shift in Chainlink's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio and an increase in open interest per exchange indicate a recovering market and bullish sentiment, supporting the possibility of LINK reaching the $22 mark...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Polymarket, which raised $70 million in its Series B funding round with backers including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, operates on zero fees, suggesting a token could support future growth. The platform's success, highlighted by a surge in trading volume and new accounts around the 2024 U.S. presidential election, has further fueled these speculations...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: $2K or Below, which do you think is the bottom this month and why, share your TA wisdom!
25
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbxyqs)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Since it touched 200SMA (yellow curve) two times already, I think we’re at the bottom or near it. If it goes lower, it should not stay long there in my opinion. Also RSI is statistically rarely on such low levels. I think ETH will form a consolidation formation here, might take weeks or months, then it should go further up as a part of the next bull run cycle.

No one really knows the bottom which is very worrying 🙁..!tip 1

If the price drops below $2100 then $1800 is next. Although, I don't think it will drop below 2100....**!tip 1**
2
I hope we don’t go down more..!tip 1
2
lets be fair, 4k felt a bit inflated..3k was somewhat real, this 2.something is what i feel like real and fair price, it should be a bit more, but i guess its gonna stay between 2 and 3 k range..If it goes below 2k, it will bounce back relatively quickly
2
We might see sub $2.k BigCreep. Isn't that alarming?..!tip 1

Dippidy dip dip is coming ..!tip 1

BTC bouncing off the 50MA on the yearly chart…...i’ve opend leverage longs on BTC and ETH

Just bought again so... We are still headed down.
2
i think until 17/9/2024 it will b n 2k-2.3k range then rates cut & price b n 3.1k-3.4k range within days..!tip 1

It is better to ask where btc bottom is. ETH just follows BTC and worse

Lots of support at the 0.5 Fib (\~$2100). I don't think it'll go lower...but I've been known to be wrong - just ask my ex wife lol
1
lol traditionally crypto always made a double bottom. We didn't this time. But we might if there is a serious financial crisis unwound, which is proving to be very very likely. 1k is the absolute lowest it could go imo, although very unlikely to go that low.
1
we are closer to below 2k than anything that we had above us weeks ago, and would going below rly be that bad? if u dont look at ta, thats just a better opportunity for whales to buy and hold

Title: Political Meme Coin Economy Shrinks by $420M as US Election Nears
15
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbx2jo)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

There is zero supporting evidence Trump can influence the price of any crypto asset except the coins he peddles to followers.

If you want your blue chip coins to go up vote Dem, they actually want to regulate it like an asset class which will pull more big money in.  If you want shitcoin scam season vote Trump, it's how hes funded a good chunk of his campaign

Title: Ethereum Faces Resistance at $2,300 as Market Challenges Persist
13
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbwit2)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Ethereum (ETH) is facing significant market pressures, trading around $2,296.43 with a slight increase of 0.49% over the last 24 hours. Despite the introduction of Ethereum ETFs, the market saw a decline to lows of $2,150 amid a strengthening US Dollar. The market cap remains robust, but liquidity has dropped by 40% since the ETFs' debut, raising concerns about market stability. Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term recovery, but the overall sentiment remains cautious. Ethereum's performance is lagging behind Bitcoin, with transaction activity and network usage decreasing, leading to a shift in investor preference towards Bitcoin...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Mastercard and Mercuryo have launched a new Spend debit card, enabling users to directly spend cryptocurrencies like Ethereum from their non-custodial wallets. This card, compatible with over 100 million merchants globally and major mobile payment services, supports multiple blockchain networks, including Solana, Polkadot, and ZKsync. It aims to bridge traditional finance with digital assets, offering users autonomy over their finances and facilitating the broader acceptance of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin used a popular unfinished horse drawing meme to critique VC-funded projects that prioritize flashy appearances over substance. In his version, the meme highlights how such projects have well-developed 'VC raise' and 'Homepage' elements but lack in 'Documentation' and 'Product' quality. Buterin's post, which also includes a gaming metaphor, suggests that focusing on appearance over a viable product is detrimental in competitive environments. The community praised Buterin for using humor and memes to communicate effectively...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

Title: Can Ethereum provide a settlement layer for financial markets? 
15
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbvsur)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Ethereum is currently facing a significant bearish trend, but analyst Alan Santana predicts a major comeback, with the potential to surpass $10,000 after the current market correction stabilizes. Despite the bearish outlook, including a total net outflow of $5.984 million from Ethereum spot ETFs and a 20% decline in U.S. market depth, Santana remains bullish on Ethereum's long-term potential. He notes the importance of the market reaching a bottom, which could take several months, before Ethereum can embark on its next growth phase...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; The open interest of Ethereum has recovered to its local highs, indicating a potential increase in volatility and purchasing power. The total open interest on Binance Futures is at 1.896 million, suggesting that traders may be preparing for significant price movements. This increase in open interest, along with a rise in total volume, suggests the market is becoming more active, which often precedes volatility spikes. Despite Ethereum trading below resistance areas, the growing purchasing power and market activity could signal a bullish reversal, potentially moving ETH toward the $2,500 resistance level in the coming weeks...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Tornado Cash Sees Resurgence With $50 Million Laundered This September
14
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbv1pb)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; This month, hackers have laundered $50 million in stolen cryptocurrency through Tornado Cash, a sanctioned crypto mixing service. The laundered funds are linked to breaches involving crypto projects like Penpie and the Indian WazirX exchange. Despite US sanctions in 2022, Tornado Cash's usage has surged, with significant amounts of Ethereum moved through the service by hackers. Legal debates are ongoing about the sanctionability of open-source software like Tornado Cash, amidst its continued use by cybercriminals to obscure illicit funds...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.

$50 million laundered in just one month is a lot of dirty money. Is Tornado Cash a victim of its own success? Or is it a deliberate tool for criminals?..!tip 1

the problem is not tornado itself & not the majority of regular users rather it's the bad minority using it for their bad purposes, any way to stop bad actors while keeping tornado alive? -that's the question..!tip 1

MEV can be described as "The good, the bad and the ugly"..!tip 1
2
tldr; Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has become a significant issue in Ethereum's decentralized finance, involving profits from transaction ordering in blocks. Originally a minor concern, MEV's implications for ethics, regulation, and blockchain efficiency have made it a central debate topic. MEV challenges traditional regulatory frameworks due to its dynamic nature, particularly in how transactions are processed. While MEV can enhance network efficiency and security, it also poses risks of centralization and market manipulation. The transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in Ethereum, known as 'The Merge,' has changed the roles in MEV extraction but not its fundamental dynamics. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing MEV practices, highlighting the need for technological and regulatory approaches to mitigate its negative impacts while preserving its benefits for network participation and security...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Ethereum's price increased by nearly 3% to $2,300, influenced by developments in ETFs. WisdomTree withdrew its application for a spot Ether ETF, and VanEck closed its futures-based Ether ETF due to low demand. These moves reflect challenges in the demand for Ethereum-based financial products and regulatory hurdles. Despite this, Ethereum shows signs of recovery, but faces resistance levels that could limit its upward potential. The market for Ethereum-based ETFs may need more time to mature, highlighting the evolving nature of Ethereum as an asset class...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Hackers continue to target Ethereum, with significant amounts stolen and often laundered through Tornado Cash to avoid tracking. Despite security measures, the crypto world still faces major attacks, with recent data highlighting significant Ethereum-targeted heists. These include the Penpie attack with 11,261.2 Ethereum stolen, the WazirX scandal involving 7,600 ETH, and incidents involving Bo Shen and LiFi. Security measures in the crypto industry struggle to keep up with new vulnerabilities exploited by attackers, leading to substantial losses...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; The ONDO Finance token is experiencing a significant price slide, with less than 14% of its total supply in circulation and trading in green for only 11 days in the last 30 days. Despite a 260% increase in the last year, the token's price has been highly volatile, with a current market cap of $814.61M, making it the 70th largest cryptocurrency. Investor sentiment is bearish, with a fear and greed index of 23 indicating extreme fear. Trading activity has risen, with an 85% increase in traded volume value in the last 24 hours. The token is held by 62.6K addresses, with the top 10 holders owning 87% of the supply. Technical analysis suggests the price is in a strong downtrend, forming a falling wedge pattern. If the price breaks above this pattern, higher levels could be seen in the future. However, current indicators show bearish momentum, with potential support at $0.20 and $0.380, and resistance at $1.040 and $1.480...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Tadle Joins Chainlink Build To Unlock Liquidity In Crypto Pre-Markets
10
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbtyau)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Tadle, a platform for crypto pre-markets, has joined the Chainlink Build program to accelerate its growth and the adoption of crypto pre-markets using Chainlink's oracle services. Tadle aims to enhance liquidity and market reach for emerging projects by connecting pre-market assets with secondary markets. It plans to launch a Points Marketplace for trading points from projects and expand support for other pre-market assets. Tadle will integrate Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to bridge primary and secondary markets, leveraging Chainlink's secure oracle network...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: ‘We’ve Barely Started’ – Analyst Predicts Craziest Bull Market Yet, Unveils Timeline for Massive Crypto Surges
33
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbtvsl)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; A prominent crypto analyst, Kaleo, predicts a significant bull market for cryptocurrencies, suggesting the biggest gains are yet to come. He forecasts a strong rally from October 2023 to March 2024, indicating a potentially unprecedented market surge. Kaleo compares current market sentiment to that of September 2023, before a major uptick, and bases his optimism on historical patterns around Bitcoin halvings. He anticipates a slight downturn in September but expects substantial growth through the election and into 2025...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Fed Report Analyzes How Crypto Price Shifts Influence Ownership

[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbtri7)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; A Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia study found that cryptocurrency ownership decreased during market declines, despite rising Bitcoin prices. The Consumer Finance Institute's report, based on data from six surveys since January 2022, showed that both ownership and interest in purchasing cryptocurrencies dropped as market values decreased. The study, using Bitcoin as a benchmark, suggests the need for further research to understand consumer reactions to market changes, noting that ownership rates have not increased in line with Bitcoin's price surge since October 2023...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Arbitrum (ARB) is on the brink of a bullish breakout, potentially leading to a 25% price increase. Despite a recent slight bullish trend, a bullish falling wedge pattern and a bullish divergence on technical indicators suggest a strong potential for a price surge. On-chain data shows improvements in Arbitrum's MVRV ratio and network growth, indicating increased investor confidence and new address creation. However, a decline in the long/short ratio signals more short positions, presenting a bearish signal. Yet, market indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow and Relative Strength Index are bullish, increasing the likelihood of a breakout...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) protocol revenue from Layer 2 (L2) solutions has plummeted to nearly zero, according to Galaxy Research. This decline is attributed to the efficiency improvements in L2 solutions like zk-rollups, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which now process transactions off-chain more effectively, reducing the need for costly L1 interactions. This shift raises concerns about the sustainability of Ethereum's security model, which relies on transaction fees for validator incentives and security maintenance...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Uniswap [UNI], a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has recently broken out of its bearish trend, signaling a potential recovery. After testing key support levels between $5.5 and $5.7, UNI showed signs of a rebound, with its price hovering just above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $6.20. This movement suggests a shift in market sentiment, with a possible retest of the $6.75 level near the 50-day EMA on the horizon. However, the market remains volatile, and UNI's long-term trajectory has been bearish since reaching a 2-year high in March 2024. The altcoin's recovery is contingent on maintaining momentum above the 20-day EMA, with technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) providing insights into market momentum and selling pressure. Despite a slight bearish edge among traders, there's stronger bullish sentiment on Binance, indicating a cautious optimism for UNI's future...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a fixed value, often pegged to a real currency like the U.S. dollar, making its value stable over time. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins aim to offer a stable medium for transactions. They are typically backed by reserves of the asset they're pegged to, ensuring their value remains constant. However, risks include security vulnerabilities, counterparty risks, and the potential for reserve shortfalls. The article also discusses the scrutiny from federal officials over the stability and backing of stablecoins, highlighting the importance of verifying a stablecoin's safety through issuer reserve reports...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Peter Schiff, on his show, predicts a collapse in financial markets if the Federal Reserve doesn't implement a substantial rate cut soon. He criticizes the Fed's current approach, fearing only a 25 basis point cut might lead to market declines. Schiff also discusses recent stock market performances, highlighting the downturn in tech stocks and the shift towards value stocks. He notes the decline in gold stocks despite stable gold prices and predicts a significant drop in cryptocurrencies, specifically forecasting Bitcoin to fall below $50,000 soon...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Title: Why Ethereum may hit +$4k in a few months
28
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbsywp)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

I still believe in $4k happening as well. ETH is the top 10 alt with the most room to grow yet this year. I remain very optimistic that Q4 will be worth the wait. I also have huge bags of TON, LINK, PICA, FET, PENDLE.

Trump is well-known not to fulfill all of his promises. He probably sees crypto as another grift.

None of these will do us any good. The market sentiment needs to change for us to see any sort of pump. No hype, no pump...^(!tip 1)

While your points are relevant, what matters most is how we the consumers respond to these factors. And whether or not more consumers start to utilize crypto or not. Ultimately, it seems as though crypto will be very commonplace in the near future !tip 1

Title: US National Debt Explodes by $684,322,497,000 in Three Months As Fitch Warns America Has Failed To Fix Growing Debt Burden
20
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbsvej)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Blame the government. Oh wait. They're too busy pointing red bad and blue good instead of standing up to the real issue that they're both the same and that's the whole problem. Both side suck and anyone defending either  is what's really dividing us

Title: Polygon Price Prediction 2024, 2025-2030
15
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbsn5v)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

Title: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Losing Ground? Key Report Explains ETH Struggles
13
[Tip this post.](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?action=tip&contentId=t3_1fbsmxs)..On-chain and off-chain tip confirmations below...----------.            ....    **New Voting and Reward System**..    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month..       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS..       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote..    2. **Weighted Votes:**.       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance)..       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0)..       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight)..    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**.       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count..       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments..    4. **Transparency:**.       * Tip records will look like this:..          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`..    **Guidelines:**..    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation..    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially..    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action...    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! 🚀

tldr; Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing significant selling pressure, with a 23% decline bringing its price down to yearly lows at $2,200. This underperformance compared to Bitcoin has been ongoing since September 2022, with Ethereum falling 44% against Bitcoin. A report from CryptoQuant attributes Ethereum's struggles to declining on-chain activity, shrinking institutional interest, and the underwhelming performance of Ethereum ETFs. The ETH/BTC pair is at its lowest level since April 2021, and Ethereum's supply dynamics and preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum in trading volumes are not supportive of a price increase for ETH. Ethereum's future performance remains uncertain as it faces volatility and tests local demand near yearly lows...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Hello. You are receiving this message either because you don't have enough age/karma or because your command is not formatted properly. ..* If the former, you need a minimum of 1 month account age and 100 comment karma to flair submissions. ..* If the latter, you probably didn't capitalize the first letter or used a slightly different variation of spacing/spelling/punctuation. For example, if you want to flair a submission with *News* flair, use *News* instead of *news*. See here: `[AutoMod] News`. **TLDR:** Flair names are case-sensitive. At the current time, the acceptable post flairs are: Comedy, Discussion, Meta & Donut, News, Sentiment, Trading, Media and Self Story...If certain flair commands are formatted correctly but do not work, please [inform the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fethtrader)....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

tldr; The article discusses the unrealistic price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) to reach $1, $0.01, or even $0.001 due to the enormous market capitalization these prices would entail. For SHIB to hit $1, its market cap would need to be $589 trillion, surpassing the estimated global wealth of $454 trillion. Even reaching $0.01 would require a market cap of $5.89 trillion, over five times the current valuation of Bitcoin. Critics argue these targets are far-fetched, considering the current and potential market valuations of SHIB...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Hello. You are receiving this message either because you don't have enough age/karma or because your command is not formatted properly. ..* If the former, you need a minimum of 1 month account age and 100 comment karma to flair submissions. ..* If the latter, you probably didn't capitalize the first letter or used a slightly different variation of spacing/spelling/punctuation. For example, if you want to flair a submission with *News* flair, use *News* instead of *news*. See here: `[AutoMod] News`. **TLDR:** Flair names are case-sensitive. At the current time, the acceptable post flairs are: Comedy, Discussion, Meta & Donut, News, Sentiment, Trading, Media and Self Story...If certain flair commands are formatted correctly but do not work, please [inform the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fethtrader)....*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ethtrader) if you have any questions or concerns.*

To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:..    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**.       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts.

tldr; The Penpie DeFi protocol, a platform designed for liquidity provision and yield farming, was hacked on September 4, 2024, resulting in a loss of over $27 million in crypto assets, primarily Ethereum. Despite the Penpie team's efforts to recover the funds by offering a bounty and inviting the hacker to join as a white-hat hacker, the exploiter laundered all the stolen funds through the Tornado Cash platform, rejecting any negotiation with the Penpie team...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

tldr; Vice President Kamala Harris supports President Joe Biden's tax plan, which includes a 25% tax on unrealized gains for individuals with over $100 million in net assets, aiming to generate $5 trillion in revenue over a decade. This plan is part of a broader strategy to address the U.S. deficit and debt, ensuring high-net-worth individuals contribute a fairer share. It also proposes increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, which, combined with other taxes, could position the U.S. as having the highest total tax rate on corporate income in the developed world. The plan faces potential challenges in Congress, even with a Democratic majority...*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.
223
How the hell would that even work?  What happens if your unrealized gains are $250M on 1-1, but by 4-15, the stock tanks and you're only worth $10M?
143
To be fair its only for people with **at least $100 million in net assets.**..Still, it's still taxing unrealized gains which is insanity to me...>! !tip 1 !<
109
thankfully this effects absolutely nobody in this sub
95
$400k is great income but it’s not high-net worth. ..What part of taxing the 100+ times over millionaires and billionaires did they not understand. ..Making $400k is not rich. It’s doing well. But not rich by any stretch.
4
Taxing unrealized gains, no thanks...!tip 1
8
The very idea of taxing unrealized gains is ludicrous. And rest assured, if implemented, 30 years from now it will apply to the middle class as well.
26
25% tax on high net individual Indeed. The rich will take the taxes from the poor and give to the government. .That's how it has always been. ...!tip 1
9
Anyone who thinks this shit idea doesn’t creep it’s way to everyone within a decade is a ra-tard
11
They'll try to pass this by saying, "Hey! Don't worry! It will only be on people that make more than $100 million!"..Then, like literally every other tax, they will do two things when it doesn't get them enough money, just like the original Federal income tax and most state taxes. First, they will say, "Hey! We're creating a 10% bracket for those with more than $1 million. But don't worry! It's only on them!" Then it will be, "Hey! We're creating a 5% bracket, but it's only on those with more than $100,000!" EVERY country in the world that creates a tax has done this over time...The second thing is more insidious - they will absolutely not index any of our new tax brackets for inflation. The Alternative Minimum Tax. A 10% tax originally designed to target the richest 154 families, has gone to 21%, then 24%, 26% and now 28%. Today? The 2023 threshold for single taxpayers is $81,300, $63,250 for Married, filing separately...Aside from a few conservative states, how many times have you seen a government not do both?
5
How stupid do you have to be to even propose something like that
7
The Dems don't have an actual plan. They are attempting to buy votes with promises, like they did in 20. ..How's your student loan forgiveness?..Not to mention those with money will always have loopholes, namely trust fund and non profits. ..If they make you pay unrealised gains, do we also get unrealized loss deduct?

This is not a problem for those under 100m but if you think the government won’t claw to reduce this minimum threshold on this in our lifetime then you are delusional.
2
So this bill applies to those “with 100 million in wealth who do not pay 25% tax rate on their income”. Do you know ANYBODY that fits this criteria? It doesn’t affect you! ANNNNDDD, these people SHOULD pay 25%! I fucking pay more and make wayyy less!
8
Can’t wait for them to preach high net worth just the tippy top and 100m plus to end up being anyone with $1-2 million net worth lol. ...This is regressive and the logical conclusion of government and taxation.

I think there should be a billionaire tax...Once you have a billion in personal wealth, your as rich as you need to be. Everything beyond a billion is channelled back to those that are in need and a running total should be shown for each billionaire of the money they have provided those less fortunate.

I am for this. I think it aligns with the overarching philosophy of cryptocurrency in general...This policy will be a disincentive to hoard wealth, and effectively, redistribute it. Distributed, decentralized, sound familiar?..Right now, what we have with the super wealthy, is a situation where they'll never have to sell an asset to be liquid, and therefor, can continue to hoard additional wealth. How dose this work? You barrow against your wealth at a low percent, say 5%, and leave your assets in the market earning a higher percentage, lets say 7%...Now, instead of cashing out your investment to get cash, you've instead earned 2% simply by using someone else's money. This is a system of banking not available to the rest of us. In a situation like this, wealth accumulation is run away. Literally, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, on and on until all wealth in centralized in the top .0001%, which is the direction we are heading now. And, something crypto is meant to fight against. ..Lets take this example I just gave above of 5% and 7% and lets say the term of the loan is a year. You'll be earning 2% over the course of a year by spending the banks money, not your own investment capital. What this tax does, is knock that percentage down to 1.5%. That's it. Baby steps. ..This still leaves room for the rich to get richer, but it slows it down a bit. Now, the capital gain is still going to be taxed at some point, this just moves that tax event forward. You'll not be taxed for unrealized gains and then taxed on it again when they are realized. ..Anyone who's attracted to cryptocurrency as a philosophy should support this policy.

When does it evolve into. "Well you are a janitor now but your unrealized potential is CEO of the company. Pay us based on your unrealized potential".Absolute insanity to even propose a tax on unrealized gains. It shows the short sightedness and lack of understanding basic economics.  .Not that anyone reads more than a paragraph but it's a decent read on it. https://www.aier.org/article/unrealized-gains-tax-is-an-economic-fallacy/

Has anyone talked to them about closing the tax haven loopholes for the corporations first?..If I assign the asset ownership to a trust fund that foots all my bills but isn't owned by me, will it still count here?..Looks like Joe's delirious delusional fever dreams are rubbing off on Harris...
1
I have very limited financial literacy, so forgive the dumb question, but can someone walk me through this.....You create a corporation. As creator, you allocate the largest amount of stock in the company for yourself to maintain control of it (51% ownership) The company performs incredibly well and your stocks are worth 20x what they were...and now you as the creator must sell off portions of your stock to pay the capital gains you've made on your unrealized gains?! How do CEO's/Founders maintain control of their companies in this model?

So if you can get taxed for unrealized gains, couldn’t you also claim unrealized losses too? You could yank your own stock come tax season, and then pump it back up the rest of the year. Easy money

Can’t believe I’m considering voting for orange man

This isn't the way of doing it... You can't tax unrealized gains. SO fucking dumb.
1
Where did this come from? This is the most stupid thing I have heard. How would that even work? 25% is hyperbole. I could see a 0.1% tax or less on total tangible wealth.   .  .Hell, my LPL Financial account takes 1.5% of my total wealth every year. That is total wealth, not unrealized gain. That is, I pay whether I win or lose. And, furthermore, it sells assets to pay that fee, and then I have to pay tax on any realized gains of those sales. ..It can be done in a similar manner, but 25% is ridiculous.

How bout they just stop spending out the hoo-ha.

about time! or rather make it 80% tax rste for the next 10 years for anyone making 100million and above.

You all realize this is how your retirement is drained. You will own nothing and be happy right

Horrible idea👎
1
In 1913, regular income tax started out as just for the wealthy, a way to "soak the rich"--we see how that turned out. This is a slippery slope.
1
This is not a well thought out policy. I’m not in the brackets targeted but there is no way this is fair. If and when this is law it opens the post of ridiculous treatment of anyone that saves for retirement. I vote democratic but only by the other side is so fucked up. Some things are just wrong in principle.

"unrealized "what does that mean ?

Unrealized gains are just that not sold yet. This is a bad idea. Sets a precident you can't undo. Will not stop there

They know in the next 15 to 20 years the dept to gdp will be at 200% .Once they get there no amount of raising tax's and cutting spending will save them

Thats how starts and sheeple.support this... just like the 600 dollars transfers down from 10k.
1
I fear this will slowly trickle done from $100M net worth to affect more and more people over time. Just like income tax.
1
Could you imagine if they tax those people on unrealized gains and then the market tanks
1
What should worry people is the government has a habit of opening a door like this then changing over time who is taxed like this.  Meaning 10 years from know it’s people who make 250k as an example.  Because the gov always needs more money.
1
This is the main rebuttal "But it doesn't target you, why are you against it"..This is the main answer I give. [Legal history of income tax in the United States - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_income_tax_in_the_United_States#First_income_tax_law)

We should have the highest corporate tax rate you should pay a premium simply because you make more money here than you do anywhere else on the planet. When I hear people complain about taxes they owe I say sh*t  I wish I made enough money to owe taxes lol. I mean I pay taxes but I look forward to tax season because I get money back those of you that owe should thank your country by giving back a little for giving you the opportunity to make that kind of money. That’s the american dream. That’s why people come here with there ideas because American capitalism is structured so that you can trap the rewards. People don’t take their ideas to China because they know that communism will only let you keep what you make until they decide you have too much then you disappear for a while and pop up like Jack Ma singing the song of Chi’s choice. Here you can openly mock your government and make millions or billions. Like Warren Buffet says I’m happy to pay taxes this country is the only country I could be as successful as I am.
1
Lip service. Taxing unrealized income isn’t even lightly legal.
1
Aren’t property taxes also taxes on unrealized gains or losses? When value goes up you pay more? When value goes down, you still pay but pay less? That’s why I oppose any new creative tax even though it will never apply to me.
1
**What's False**..… The plan specified that the tax would apply only to those with wealth exceeding $100 million — i.e., not the middle class. Given that it would therefore only affect the wealthiest 0.01% in the country, it is unlikely to cause an "economic calamity."..[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harris-capital-gains-tax/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harris-capital-gains-tax/)

Everyone saying “it’s only if you have 100M in assets”…. Not realizing this is just HOW IT STARTS.. You think they stop there or keep going over time until they are taxing everyone, even if it’s “just a little”…. .  Our forefathers are rolling in their graves.

The rich don't pay taxes of any kind and never will. All us middle class shlubs will always foot the bill. Oh wait even all of our money doesn't make a f#@k. Bankruptcy here we come...

I don’t believe cutting corporate tax rates attracts businesses all it does is make the rich richer our institutions regulations and laws that support a robust capitalism with out prejudice, attracts businesses furthermore, if cutting tax rates supposed to mean that CEOs could afford to pay higher wages well that might be true until you get down to the blue collar workers they never see a dime of that

If unrealized gains get taxed , realize unrealized losses are a write off, it’s proposed and cannot be practically traced. Tactics are, don’t believe this can be achieved by a government that the IRS fails daily,,, millions/billions gained in any vested account this market money will just  be placed in the other market ….This passes no financial gain market test world wide ,,,,, this is another read & vote not in fear of the bold header… just not true

The magat working at a saw mill will be up in arms about a tax on something he doesn't even participate in.

Just curious, how exactly are unrealized gains taxed?
1
ok here with taxing a few of the ultra rich a bit more.  Not sure why one would complain except to reduce loop hold or squabble over the definition of ultrarich
1
Have they ever thought of spending less….
1
and please stop with the slippery slope argument, its silly.  Oh, we are going to raise taxes on the rich, next thing they will start taxing the kinda rich, and then the kinda middle class, and then the poor, and where will it end because once it starts there is of course no end.  Well of course it will end with the government going after our pets and taking a portion of their kibbles, but no, it won't stop there, they will them go after our pet fish food.
1
The amount of money the .01% has sent offshore, without paying tax is more than the national debt. May be that money SHOULD be used to pay off the debt.
1
A tax on unrealized gains is fucking stupid and illogical,  but fuck it. It's time. I don't care about ethics or morals anymore. Take the billionaires' money. 25% is too low. Anything over $25m in unrealized gains should be taxed at 100%.
1
I will ALWAYS support heavy taxes on people who inherit trust funds and live lives of luxury off their investments without ever having to work...However, this seems like a tax nightmare. Is this really better than just increasing the capital gains tax on top earners along with an increased estate tax? Wouldn't that achieve the same result?
1
It is criminal and non sensical to have someone in power who knows so little about economics.

This doesn’t affect any of you mentally regarded regards

The government just prints money and sells debt to other countries. There's no point in having taxes.

If this has a chance of working then they need to tax the unrealized gains when they are used as collateral.

Get bent

These people are just going to leave the U.S. and our government will be even poorer than before, then to make up for it they’ll print themselves money to make up for it and cause the value of our mo yea to decrease even further. I’m all for having the rich pay their fair share, but we can’t drive these people out with ridiculous tax rates.

I would only support a wealth tax if the money collected is directly redistributed equally to all citizens. I would never use a tax on billionaires to pay off the national debt. Do not reward government irresponsibility. Instead, if the wealth gap is large just nip it in the bud and reduce it. Call it a citizen dividend and base it on some metric that measures the size of the gap between the rich and the middle class. It pays out like profit sharing or something. If the wealth gap increases then everybody gets a bigger dividend, if the wealth gap decreases then everybody gets a smaller dividend. There are 333 million Americans and 756 billionaires or something like that. If all of the billionaires were to pay a proportional wealth tax amounting to an extra $25/month income for every American, direct deposit, that would cost about $100B/year. Would the billionaires be able to pay that? Well, the total wealth of American billionaires is around $5.5T. If we divide $5.5T by $100B we get 55. That means American billionaires could make 55 annual payments of $100B to the American people and would not run out of money until like 2080 or something (not accounting for other factors obviously). But that would not be enough money to really help people. It is a way of increasing the velocity of money though. It's dumb to inflate the money supply with stimulus. If you want people to spend money just take it from the ultra rich and give it to everybody. 333 million people getting an extra $25/month would mean the government would be taking a total of $8B/month from the ultra rich and redistributing it equally among the citizenry. The people then spend it, some save, they support businesses and pay taxes. As I said though, the key is to make the dividend as small as possible, and never let it get too large. I would guess it would need to stay between $0 and $50 per month. Maybe it hovers around $10/month most of the time. Maybe right now it would be at like $40/month. Or maybe it's just a load of bread and you have to wait in line for hours to get it.
1
What was the tax when the Boston tea party happened?
1
I'm surprised that their approach wasn't a little bit more reasonable. ..It would make more sense to tax lending on unrealized gains. So if I own something worth a billion dollars and I am going to leverage that in order to borrow 250 million. Tax that amount that I am borrowing. Maybe something like 10%, so 25 million. So I would have to borrow a little bit closer to 275 million to cover my 250 million purchase...The problem with taxing unrealized gains instead of just taxing different forms of spending is that unrealized gains are unrealized. That thing I own which is worth 1 billion won't always be worth that. It might go to zero. You can't text me on something that can just as easily go to zero. We have to stay focused on taxing money when it is actually being acted upon.
1
And all that money will just go to defense spending, Ukraine, and Israel
1
Well, I foresee a significant problem. The very people in Congress that will have to craft this legislation are, in fact, high-net-worth individuals. If they are not themselves, the Corporations and individuals that funnel them “donations” most certainly are...I honestly believe this is an election year talking point that won’t go anywhere.
1
This is absolutely insane to me. You have to pay for something which is not yet realized and if the asset goes down after the payment? xD..!tip 1
1
Will someone who supports tax increases please explain why you think it’s okay to take other people’s things? It just feels like graft. We don’t know where the money is going. It’s not like a gas tax (which makes sense) which goes directly to the highway trust fund and helps repair roads. It’s just money for them to do whatever with and it’ll probably end up supporting another country that hates us. You are advocating for the government to have more of its peoples’ money. That’s it. But please… explain.
1
Saying it is one thing, when are they ever going to pass this? Wasn’t Biden trying this his entire term? It’s just empty promises to wi. The election until it actually gets done.

Hell yes!

It starts off with "high net worth" individuals , and then will slowly spread to everyone. Don't vote her in

Why don't they implement that right now? She could literally tell Biden to do this

Earnings should be announced during market hours not before and after

It is fucked up. It is smoke.  The wealthy would not allow that to happen...Honestly, as a poor person with some investments, I don't want it to happen either - I mean how could I pay the tax without selling what I have first?
1
They did the same in 1913 with federal income tax. It was only supposed to affect the wealthy... now I lose 35% of my pay to leaches...Fuck that hoe.

Tax the rich, plain and simple.

Why not tax individuals less? I mean, they're going to print whatever they want, whenever they want. Right?

It’s a retarded plan and has 0 chance of passing. It’s just pandering to low info voters

I'm gonna be really mad if I ever multiply my net worth 100x...Unforced error on her part either way.

So they get taxed just holding? Then if they sell they pay tax again? Seems like theft

This prostitute will tax everyone. Puppet of deep state to take down America
1
The people Kamala is targeting are not dumb. They can afford powerful lawyers that create tax-avoidance strategies...Besides, tax on unrealized gains is stupid. So if I pay taxes on $10 million paper gains, what happens if the gains evaporate tomorrow? Would the govt refund the tax they already collected?..Most investors would cash out of their investment if they're forced to pay taxes on them. Of course, that would kill a lot of companies, who then won't have money to operate.
1
So long as I’m able to take unrealized losses. I may loose 250m next year. So I’m gonna go ahead and take that write off. I expect a fantastic tax refund check.
1
Just tax 1% of the wealth on everybody… no admin, no complaints, no headaches
1
For those that are saying “this won’t effect me, who cares”, keep this in mind. The rich will get around this, and with the government wanting their money, it will trickle down to the middle class since the precedence has been set. Back in the 60s, you could buy a home for 60k. Now that same home may be worth 300-400k, and for most it is there biggest asset. Add in inflation, you’ll see governments assessing homes and then forcing people to sell just to cover their unrealized gains.
1
All the broke ass haters gonna be defending the 1% on this

I remember in the UK when Jeremy Corbyn was proposing something similar during that tv question time one of the audience mentioned that he read the proposed law and it said “wealthy” was defined as about 100k a year he said he made that much and he wasn’t wealthy. They told him over $100k the Labour government considered him wealthy

Good when someone who holds enough shares to become the richest person overnight should have to sell and pay taxes instead of just taking out fucking loans to pay for yachts and mansions using their capital as leverage and then never ever having to pay taxes at all because they are in a infinite loop of taking out mega loans.

Thats like taxing for holding
1
Billionaires are going to spend more money spreading misinformation about this and lobbying politicians then they would've spent on the tax.
1
Imagine proposing something that would totally wipe out the stock market, and sabotage businesses...Like let's say you owned controlling share of a company and you were managing it really well...Then everyone saw that and decided to buy your stock. It goes up by 300%..Due to the unrealized capital gains tax, you're forced to sell massive amounts of your stock to pay the taxes...You have to sell a large amount of your shares to cover it.  You now tank the stock price.  And also potentially losing controlling share...This is also ridiculously stupid. Considering the value of the us stock market is 50 trillion dollars and the total m2 money supply is only 20 trillion dollar, hypothetically the government could be requesting more money in that's than what's in existance under the right circumstances and assuming the value continues to diverge
1
Does this even work for most billionaires? Don’t they like all have money in a trust fund technically not in their name so it doesn’t count as their legal net worth? They’ll just use loopholes to avoid having a high net worth tied to their name..
1
I mean wouldn't ot be great if thr government stopped the majority of ots spending and we could get rid of taxes
1
Good policy. Only impacts those with 100m

A wild idea, what if they rather rationalize public spending and spend within the budget means, as every freaking other person/company does, rather than implement new taxes and raise existent ones?

The income tax also only targeted the rich. If this becomes a reality, it 100% will make its way down to everyone else

I find it hard to believe that they would lower it to a much lower threshold because I don’t think most wealthy politicians would want it to apply to them!
1
So in simple words. "tax the rich" sounds good to me
1
So far only 19 of my friends are freaking out over this because their source of news doesn't mention the small detail about it being on income of $100 million dollars.

I know where a couple of 105s are fully transferable. No class III application

So if the stock/account tanks does the government pay you, or refund tax it took, lol. This will never happen, but it sounds great to middle class voters she is appealing to.

Good make them pay

So if the stock goes down after you pay the tax are they going to give it back,? If you lose money are they going to make you whole?
1
Once you hear from bureaucrats "Don't worry....we'll ***only*** do it to ***those*** people"...the gig is up.
1
Tax loans that are backed by assets that have not been taxed. If you take out a loan backed by stocks you get taxed, if you take out a loan backed by your house you don't pay taxes that loan because you already pay taxes on the house.Seems pretty simple...Not that I don't think we shouldn't tax the hell out of ultra wealthy. I don't like the idea of taxing unrealized gains outright because that value is unrealized your tax is based on something that hasn't been actioned on. If you take out a loan on it then you are creating value. It's more the principal behind it could eventually creep down to the point it impacts me the average person. You think I'm crazy but they keep raising retirement age and when social security was first created they said they would never raise it.
1
There are actual millionaires and embarrassed millionaires aka not millionaires who believe these policies will affect them somehow.  ..That being said, taxing unrealized gains is insanity.
1
Yea and in no time itll apply to everyone else.

This is absolutely stupid to the 10th degree. I hope this is misinformation. This is the kind of crap that is going to force me to vote trump

How would those with over $100million in net assets pay this tax? Would they have to hand over their assets or cash them out?

Some seriously braindead takes and simping for billionaires in this thread..Or just bots

look, I support wealth redistribution 100%, but this is quite easy to bypass. rich people arent dumb, they are going to take their money and invest in a different country, more US jobs will be lost, and things will only get worse. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m legitimately concerned that this bill might not help as much as we thought…

All this will do is get high-net-worth individuals to transfer all their financial vehicles into an LLC.

It is a 25% minimum tax which includes taxing unrealized gains if you have over $100M.

The good news is that Harris'  tax policies which sound good on face value, but probably will attack the working class and the professional class versus the ultra rich, will never come to fruition.  even if Harris is able to eak  out a win November,  the Senate is going to go Republican. having a divided government  is probably the best thing for the people earning between $150,000-$400,000. republicans  help people making over $400,000.  Democrats help people making less than hundred thousand dollars.  the people that do the work making between 150,000 and $400,000 get fucked over by everyone!!

To then to what with that money?  More wars? More genocide? More police brutality?  More corporate greed?  ..The government doesn’t need more money.  They need to use the money they already have to benefit the people.  Taxing the rich won’t help the people when our government is morally bankrupt.

CORRECTION: Kamala's handlers proposed a 25% tax on unrealized gain. She doesn't know what this gobbledygook means.
1
25 % is way too high. It’s impossible to get everyone agree but rising inequality is a time bomb waiting to explode. It will be ideal if the taxation somehow made to reflect inequality. It can be a metric based on one’s networth and income. A thriving economy is only possible with eradication of poverty and a healthy demography of middle class. Corporate profits do NOT reflect health of economy. Trickle down is a myth.

I propose a 100% tax on Kamala Harris

It is a disgusting thing and it is for all individuals!

Can these headlines have the 100m part in them? That's literally the most important part. ..The fuck.

The 16th Amendment clearly states that taxes can only be levied on income and not property. It will either be banned by the Supreme Court or we no longer have a viable US Constitution.
1
That’s stupid
1
Every American should be against this. It won’t affect you now but the government will change it year by year administration by administration til every American is paying taxes in there houses net worth and retirement accounts. Don’t let them get a foothold on unrealized gains

im okay with this. Us 8-figure poors need the government to tax the shit out of those 9+ figure earners

Taxation on unrealized gain is theft

F…k her and all those listening to her

This is being peddled as affecting average hardworking American’s home values when they sell. ..People who’s net worth is less than $100 million don’t need to worry lol

It's not just tor high earners that's a lie! It will affect the middle class as well

Levy a heavy tax on the donors that just put $500 million into her campaign?..Never. Will never ever happen. Because why do you think they gave her $500 million? Not because they like her, but because they can control her.

Wait until they change the definition to ultra rich to anyone who owns a home and earns 50k or more a year.

Corporations will temporarily spend more on r& d build a new building or otherwise spend profits so they dont show a surplus therefore avoiding the higher rates. Next time a republican administration lowers the rate they buy back shares and pay a lower rate . Noone tries to pay more.
1
I like it
1
If it was clear that the government could spend money effectively, then I would absolutely be in favor of more taxes, but they are grossly inefficient, slow, and bloated. Increasing taxes and blindly throwing money at things does not fix things. It can make it worse in some cases.
1
The amount of partisan bullshit in this thread is significant. Take it for what it is, an attempt at limiting generational wealth and  cutting tax loss harvesting. Let’s just say if you’re fundamentally pro to either idea or agains, that is your stance on this. ../s Either way I’m calling you a piece of shit if you don’t side with what I believe. /s

Ways to ruin a country 101. Unrealized gains taxes and 44% capital gains taxes. If people think this won’t trickle down in the future, you’ve lost it.
1
Evryones a liberal until it affects them

People always are bewildered how they would tax unrealized gains. It’s simple really. DCA your portfolio, at the end of the year you get an average worth of your assets. Pay taxes on that average worth. If it goes up you pay more, if it goes down, pay less ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. If on average your 100,000 shares of NVDA were worth $100 each, then you pay taxes on $10,000,000. If you buy and sell within the year, it’s not subject to unrealized gains tax. The whole point is long term assets that the rich use as collateral.
1
This would impact around 10,000 people in U.S. rest of you shouldn’t care

The corporations will just raise prices and cut workers hours again. The CEO  isn't taking a pay cut. The shareholders aren't taking a hit on their roi. It affects us all.

A tax on unrealized gains is evil and the dumbest economic policy ever proposed and it would destroy the country. ..You might ask, how so? ..Well, this would create yet another tax on literally anything of value that you own - your home, retirement funds, stocks, investment funds, baseball card collection, etc etc) - anything really.  And if the government tells you your asset is worth more, the IRS will come knocking on your door and want money. Remember, you haven’t sold anything so you don’t have any new money, it’s all a theoretical gain you might realize if you sell your asset. ..Here is a simply example. Image a family farmer or any person who owns a home and the IRS/ government decides the value of the farm or your home is now 30% higher and they want you to write them another check. With the massive inflation we’ve seen over the last 4 years, that scenario is very likely. The farmer or homeowner hasn’t sold their farm or home,  so where are they going to get $ to pay this tax on the unrealized gain the IRS decides you have on your farm or home?????  ..What would happen is family farms will need to be sold to get the money to pay the tax. And guess who would buy the farm, some massive corporation and they will now control the food supply. ..The same thing will happen with your family home...Most people don’t have extra funds so they will need to sell their homes to generate the funds to pay the IRS, and they will be forced to move into apartments and rentals.  ..Don’t forget what the World Economic Forum believes, “You’ll own nothing and be happy”.  ..A tax on unrealized gains will make that a reality very quickly.
1
Do not believe the political lies. They keep the poor in chains and worship the rich.
1
Income tax also started as a tax on high earners. And then it came to everyone else. You give the government this power and soon the middle class will pay taxes on the increase of value on their home and 401k the main key to wealth and retirement for middle class Americans.
1
If you think, raising the corporate tax rate and taxing unrealized gains doesn't affect everyone that has an income you're out of your tiny mind

I assume this is in response to what CEO’s like Bezos have been doing for years. They take low interest loans out against the value of the stocks they hold each year, use the money to live on and invest in other growth assets (tax free of course), pay back the principal on the loan when due and keep the gains which are funnelled through tax havens. ..Rinse and repeat and never actually pay tax in the country you live in. ..This law would at least capture loan money that would otherwise disappear offshore.

This sucks. Anybody who thinks that Dems will stop with billionaires is mistaken.

Let her tax people who voted for her!

Dear Lord people this is only for people with more than $100M in assets.....It's made to combat folks like hedge fund managers who compound assets and then take loans against them so they never have to pay taxes. ..It's also for people who buy incredibly large life insurance policies as a method of evading taxes. ..It's exactly the kind of law we need to close the loopholes that allow the ultra wealthy to not pay anything in taxes. ..That said, it will probably never make it through Congress. ..But all you people freaking out have no clue what you're talking about.

“It’s worth noting that Biden’s proposed 25% tax on unrealized gains would solely affect individual taxpayers with over $100 million in net assets.”..You’ll be fine.

You sell in order to pay the tax...A tax on unrealized gains doesn't make things noticeable more complicated for people with over 100,000,000 in assets. .At the level of complexity these portfolios operate at, it can be factored in without being notably more difficult than it already is, or it applies to simple products like index funds and is simple to account for...It is ridiculous to think people with this level of wealth are incapable of paying for unrealized gains tax due to complexity. They already employ armies of PHDs to manage their finances.

If you have 100 million in net worth, you'll live...So this applies to like, nobody here.

Just keep it under 100m net worth then. Easy enough

This affects individual taxpayers with over $100 million in net assets… So no one on this sub and only .01% of the population. On top of that only folks making $400k per year and about 5% of households or somewhere between the 98th and 99th percentile of tax filers. ..Yet we keep have clowns pumping out these articles like it’s going to affect the majority of American. Yet I never hear or see articles on 10-20% tariffs Trump wants to impose on every country which is about a 4%+ sales tax on goods for the middle class. On top of the couple trillions he wants to give the wealthy in tax cuts…

Pretty helpful bot

So dumb. Anyone with that net worth can and will leave the states tomorrow for greener pastures

The real joke is that most Americans think taxes help people...News flash. The federal government doesnt need your taxes. When they have an issue they print more money.  The real reason they tax you is to make themselves wealthier
4
This will trigger a liquidity crisis and the stock market will collapse. Money will move to offshore accounts and never return to the American capital markets.

Maybe they could stop sending trillion dollar aircraft carriers and stealth jets to bomb the shit out of guys in flip flops. Just a wild budget sparing idea.

Ummm.... no...Because it starts with "high net worth individuals" and then "well what about millionaires?" Then "middle class" people realize they are millionaires when their house value goes up, but have no money to pay because their worth is tied up in a living necessity they can't (and shouldn't) be borrowing against...This is a stupid idea. Tax on money borrowed above cost basis of investments. Boom. Done.

Lmfao it also faces issues with the constitution, anyone thinking taxation on unrealized gains isn’t going to be challenged in court is smoking some absurdly good stuff.

Individuals with extreme wealth often contribute disproportionately little to society compared to their means. Yes it’s a good thing to use our finite economic resources in a way to produce more economic resources. Instead of squandering and wasting them. Don’t know if I necessarily agree with the tax through. There may be better/ more efficient ways at raising more revenue from the 0.01 percent. ..By the way a tax on people with over $100 million in assets would only affect 9,630 people.

So,  if you own stocks that gain 100 million in value,  you'd have to sell your stocks to pay the 25 percent in taxes? Sounds like it could cause significant problems.

It doesn’t even impact donald trump. No way he is worth 100m no matter how much he tries to say mara lago is worth.

1. Individuals worth more than $100m AND.2. Dont already pay 25% income tax AND.3. Have 80% of their wealth held as tradable assets ..It’s also spread over 3 years and unrealized losses are offset.

We have a Similar tax in Spain (Impuesto al Patrimonio) which includes unrealized gains. The value of your assets, including investments is calculated using the value on December 31st...It fucking sucks if you have highly volatile assets like crypto...Edit: In Spain, this tax is paid by anyone with more than 700k€ in assets. First residence is exempt up to 300k. So it is not only a tax for the super rich...The tax is lower though. From 0.5% to 3.5% if you have over 10M€...So yeah, it's just another fucking little thing that drags you down.
101
Worry about how it works when your net worth is over 100 million dollars. Or not and keep losing sleep about the taxes billionaires pay. They laugh at people like you all the way to the bank.
18
If you go from 250 to 10 million by tanking stocks you get a medal from wallstreetbets and kamikazecash is gonna make a video about you. 
12
The proposal spells is out quite clearly. It's only applicable to individuals with net worth over 100m...It's basically a running balance with the govt that gets trued up annually. The initial payment can be paid equally over 9 years. There's a 25% flat tax on all income for people in the bracket.
6
Yea...maybe don't take all that risk?.Why are we rewarding such risky behavior?
1
The exact same way it would work for your property taxes if you had a $250M seaside mansion on 1-1 but on 4-15 a cyclone/tsunami destroyed it

I guess you’re shit of luck body boyo/s.

It's political theater. This has nowhere even close to the 60 votes needed in the Senate. Probably not even half that.

Ypu only have to worry if you have over $100 million in assets.

Im not gonna read it either.

lol I highly doubt that anyone worth 100M+ is going to have all their shit in one stock. Come on...But I guess if it did happen, you get a bunch of deductions?

This is misinformation she hasn’t said she wants to tax unrealized gains

some countries have such a wealth tax...it sucks. Worst country I know is Spain. I would never want to live in Spain because of that.

You're supposed to pay your tax bill in cash. How you get the money is not their problem...Most of the voters Harris is pandering to don't understand what net worth means and how it's different from cash on hand. This idea does not work mechanically so it likely will not survive to implementation...If we actually wanted to tax wealth, we should tax debt made against unrealized gains. That's how the wealthy dodge the existing capital gains tax now.
1
They want to introduce such a system in the Netherlands (in 2027), only difference it will be 36% tax. Years with losses can be compensated with future gains.
1
If you have $250m on 1/1, and then lose 96% of your NW by 4/15 you’re not exactly the savvy investor/wealthy individual they care about ..!tip 1
1
Thats why you short it and make money when it tanks 😀...Always hedge your bets and have dry powder ready
1
Oh no! What if we can't discern how many billions the billionaires have?
1
It makes sense for them b/c they can take your money…
1
You sell leading up to 1/1 so you can pay your tax liability. Do you keep your realized gains reinvested without paying tax until filing? Tax is due when it’s earned, not at the filing date. I’m sure they’d have a late payment penalty if they waited until 4/15. ..Of course selling so much would likely cause stock prices to tank, so they’d probably have to slowly offload enough to pay during each tax year.
1
It won't work...But it might buy a few votes from economically naive people...And that's the real point of this proposal.
1
Lol who cares about taxes, this is why defi exists

This will happen too. ..People will have to sell American assets to foreigners to pay the tax. So prices will drop between December and April

A consistent date or other consistent benchmark? Don’t act like this is breaking the laws of physics.

Also worth noting the article is implying she proposed it and says explicitly she endorsed it. If you click on the link of where they say she endorsed it you get taken to an unrelated page.

I believe currently if you receive RSUs you are taxed on the RSUs as income and then again as capital gains when sold. But if they turn out to be worthless you can't claim a loss to offset the tax you paid on them as income? Also there are times when you trade one type of RSU for another and pay capital gains, but still without liquidating them. TLDR taxes are confusing when it comes to this stuff.
5
One really cool feature of this, actually, is it disincentivizes founders from hoarding more than $100m of founder stock. Imagine if Elon had to sell a bit of his TSLA on the way up. It would have provided much more market stability to have it more evenly held by retail...This is going to be really weird for founders whose primary assets are like, a billion dollars of stock in a company they founded. They're going to be incentivized to actually sell some, and not just use their stock as leverage to take out tax-free loans or whatever (since collateralized loans don't count as income)...Not only will this only affect the ultra wealthy, but it's only going to be really weird for the ultra wealthy who play shitty games with founder/early stage stock, since those are the only assets that will have weird price movements if someone dumps suddenly...I'd also like to point out that $100m, when invested in the most conservative ways possible, is still basically a free money printer to the tune of $5m per year, and I'm pretty confident in saying that literally no single person needs that much money lying around.
12
But "poor" people  (those who like to be poor and comfortable not improving their skills or ambitions) need help. The super rich are the bane of society and are evil...!tip 1

I'll call bullshit on this. I will read through the details but as per usual, this is likely a distortion of the truth.
4
Ummm guess who the rich will pass all that shit onto.. lol
4
it will drive the rich away. and that 100$ million will get lower with time...In countries like the Netherlands, it starts at 150k if I am not mistaken.
6
To be fair she has 0% chance of passing this. This is cute campaign messaging that's trying to communicate where she stands on income inequality and wealth inequality. 
3
That's literally **always** how it starts. Once the tax rule is implemented, changing the definition of "high-net worth individuals" is all too easy. Today it's $100M+, tomorrow it's $1M+, and in 5 years it's $100k+...In the Netherlands such a tax exists for people who have more than 100k+ Euros in assets, but they'll inevitably eventually decrease that to 10k or even 5k Euros.
5
See my comment just above - that is for now. It will inevitably get them less than they think so they'll gradually move the threshold down. They always do.
2
That’s how I come taxes started
1
The fucking most important thing about this and it’s in the comments.
1
For now

Doesn't matter if it's just the rich, that's how they got that crappy federal income tax through, and now look at us.

You have to sell enough appreciated stock to pay the taxes on unrealized gains. If you’ve held less than a year, you would be taxed additionally on that realized gain, at ordinary income rates. If it’s over a year, it should be taxed at long term capital gains rates, depending on taxable income. Income tax rates have been based on income, rather than wealth.
1
So you want billionaires never to pay taxes? They dont earn any meaningful income they take out loans against their assets and pay only interest. They sell just enough to cover that. Then when they die all those gains are not taxed and their kids get the asset at its new much higher cost basis. Google borrow and die.
1
There is some serious tax fuckery in the ultra high end...Also, mark to market taxation of stocks  is not so crazy and would in some ways promote MORE efficient capital markets.
1
Not being ok with someone stealing from you but being ok with someone stealing from someone “rich” is so hypocritical. This is like saying some third world country refugee should be entitled to steal your car because you are 100x richer than them.
1
people at that level have teams of world-class fiscal specialist and almost always get away with it
1
But the mega rich never HAVE to realize their gains because they just get loans when they need cash. There are times when poorer people have to sell because they need cash. It’s kind of unfair they have so much money that they never need to sell and can just keep accumulating wealth without paying tax
1
it would be a wealth tax..we all pay a type of wealth tax when we pay our property taxes
1
Yeah it's like the income tax was originally phrases "only 1% and only on the top earners"...If you believe that will not slippery slope all the way to your bags, I don't know what to tell you.
1
To be fair… LOL
1
It’s for people with at least $100 million in net assets…for now…..Grant them the ability to tax unrealized gains on rich people and in 50 years all unrealized gains will be taxed. Not to mention the immediate effect of the tax hike being a market crash as banks and the wealthy pull their money before they’re hit with taxes.
1
If you can borrow against unrealized gains, you should pay taxes on them too.
1
Yea, obviously they are targeting certain types of wealth that transfer. Just be explicit in the language and target just those wealth sources.
1
I think a better law would be to maintain cost-basis on inheritances after wealthy people die... Currently, when a wealthy person dies - their kids get all the money tax free!!!
0
Now they can easily justify it on rich people, look at the sentiment of this sub people don’t care but In a time of crisis they can easily just extend it to lower incomes. This is not a good precedent to set...The government has a spending problem and until that’s fixed no amount of money is enough for them. They need to balance their books. At the end of the day we get nothing more in return this is just to cover the deficit spending which is snow balling out of control.

Taxation is theft!!..!tip 1

Don’t you realize everybody in this sub is this close 🤏 to being a multi-millionaire? Just one more lucky trade.
13
It actually does. If high net worth individuals need to liquidate say 2-2.5% of their net worth every year that is going to tank stock markets or at least severely slow down the stock market growth.
24
Second & Third order effects and the expansion of policy from the precedence this sets will eventually affect everyone on this sub..Taxing unrealized gains is a no-go for anyone. They should just tax capital borrowed against high value assets and we avoid this mess

Not quite. If it forces whales to sell then the price goes down and everyones bags are worth less.

Bullshit

Fucks everyone with stocks including the index fund weenies who just want to retire some day.

It absolutely baffles me me that so many people don’t understand as simple concept as second- or third-order effects. ..We’re doomed.

Not directly. And not yet...Gatta boil that frog over a few years.

Don't you worry. It will be pushed to the lower and middle class just like all other taxes created "for the rich."

So forced selling by the people who hold 80% of assets won't affect anyone here at all?

You're fucking tripping dude. 400k a year is absolutely past middle class. I don't care if you live in Vancouver or Switzerland.

making 400 thousand dollars a year is rich in any city in the world. not fuck you rich, not i can buy anything and idgaf rich, but it’s still in the category of rich
2
Good thing it only would effect people with net worths over 100m
1
Paying hedge funds / VCs / PE shops 2-and-20 on unrealized gains, no thanks
2
The other option to tax the richest is to tax loans. Billionaires sell very little of their assets in general and use loans to pay for things. Also fix the loophole for bringing the cost basis up when they are inherited by your kids.
7
There’s a middle class?
1
why, what precedence says this will happen.
1
This.
1
The issue is the rich cheat.  Instead of cashing out when they need to spend money they take out loans instead and get tax breaks.  I appreciate that some of these billionaires have moved us forward in a way that wouldn’t have been possible without being insanely rich, looking at you musk, but the system needs to change to reflect our current world...It is clear that there needs to be a redistribution of wealth to provide for everyone.  ..1. Healthcare for everyone.2. Affordable Shelter  -  single family homes should not be owned by corps.3. UBI - as AI grows so will this..You should be able to live a simple life without needing to kneel before the corporate overlords.  If we have basic needs met then corporations won’t be able to abuse workers.

She hasn’t said she wants to do it. It’s propaganda

Ludicrous? So why do hedge funds charge 2% on AUM? - meaning not just the money I gave them, but also all the unrealized gains? Rules for thee and not for me?

There won't be a middle class in 30 years if you don't slow down the transfer of wealth to the top few percent. Policy discussions like this are healthy, the status quo is not growing a happy and healthy working class it's eroding it away

I love it when people whine about being taxed on wealth gains accrued from the stock market. Like you literally made money on a bet, you got lucky and the money came from nowhere, likely off the backs of the exploited workers of the company's holding the stock. These aren't your hard earned wages, it's gambling money that the gambling fairy gave you. Jesus Christ.

As opposed to trumps plan which is “I’ll make everything great”

People are already subjected to this. It’s called property tax and unrealized gains are adjusted and taxed every single year

They may reduce it but it would still a very high amount that 99.99999% of us would never reach.  There is zero reason to do this to middle class and even the upper class.  This is a filthy rich person issue.

The concept is just unacceptable and stupid.

its not a logical conclusion at all. And while going back to higher taxes on the extremely wealthy is regressive, that does not make it a bad decision.

Sure, and even with this tax, billionares can still exist, and keep accumulating money if they're doing productive shit in the economy. They just can't sit on idle and keep extracting wealth from the US dollar while doing nothing (until they get down to that $100m point).

I agree with this.

hahahah you kidding.. it will be passed onto us peasants as always... either through increased prices on good or services these very same godzillionaires own..

You're naive. The very notion of taxing something that doesn't exist crosses a threshold of brazen stupidity. Once they get used to that idea, they'll start to implement it elsewhere

Right, because we all exist in isolated economic systems and not one larger US economy for which this would be a net MASSIVE "L."

Trump will tariff every single item and you think this is worse? Sorry most people don't care that people with 100m are getting taxed more...HOMEGROWORDEATH is a coward MAGA supporter who blocks immediately like the coward he is...Below are 17 charts that show the many facets of the Trump and Biden economies (with the caveat that presidents only have a limited influence). Judging by the data alone, Biden produced better results, but deep psychological impact of inflation has led most voters to say they trust Trump over Biden on the economy...https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/18/trump-biden-economy-charts-compare/

Hey, go look at the original inception of the income tax and get back to me.

If you don’t think 28% corporate takes effects anyone on this sub you got another thing coming.  This is how offshoring happened last time.  Bye bye job
21
Lol...what?
1
DOESNT matter. It’s still the principle. What a shortsighted comment
1
 Now, the key word you’re missing is now. When it doesn’t work, they will expand it to everyone, like income tax.
1
slippery slope. these people will need to sell assets to raise cash to pay the taxes... thus affecting all asset classes and all classes of investors including everyone on this sub. it's going to be a vicious spiral of wealth destruction and deflation everywhere.
1
lmaoooo burnt, but yeah this is so real
1
lol. Government incrementally takes more over time.  ...Might take a few decades but value of net assets/income they tax will decrease over time. 20-30 years goes by faster than a lot of the young people on the crypto subs realize....I partially understand why mainstream republicans aren't favored by many, but I really don't get the love for Harris or democrats. Especially by crypto supporters. 
1
TIL this sub is full of temporarily embarrassed decamillionaires..Edit: centamillionaires

Just out of curiosity, what happens to asset prices when these high net worth individuals need to pay this tax? Do you think they all just have the cash sitting around?
1
Ironically this is the most active post on this subreddit for years in terms of comments lol
1
For now.   It always starts with "it doesn't effect me" ..They go after the people who get no sympathy first.
1
This impacts everyone!  What do you think will happen when the selling begins to avoid the effective date of this tax? Markets will sell off and people will panic. Margin accounts will have margin calls leading to more selling.   This is a nightmare plan. .And anyone who believes they will stick to $100M level are fools. Look at history - Taxes started at 2% and now literally everything is taxed!  🤷🏻‍♂️
1
It doesn't affect anyone because it's not a serious proposal that will ever be implemented
1
How clueless are you, no one has 25% of their net worth in liquid cash, they would have to sell investments and crash the market???
1
Still a horrible policy. It makes taxes incredibly more complicated for no benefit. You pay the tax when you make the money; it makes sense, there's no need to screw with it.
1
It will. They always introduce a tax with the wealthy and then it moves to everyone
1
the unrealized gains tax will definitely affect everyone. this will lead to less investment in the US. stop being so short sighted. horrible policy.....not to mention, the increase to 28% in corporate tax WILL affect every single business owner.
1
Yeah it does it always trickles down
1
But it would affect the economy if everyone holding over 100 million in stock was forced to sell.
1
Lmao it always hurts the little guy in stocks or crypto. Experienced traders with large capital will just find ways to avoid through their lawyer and financial aids. None of you that say this is not a big deal never tried to educate yourself or understand taxes, capital gains and the stock market. “Doesn’t effect anyone” shows a huge misunderstanding and how little most people think ahead and focus on investing. Just say you have you never educated yourself on financial freedom and how assets are affected by policy. ..I’ve been in stocks and crypto for years this tax is bad for the market and individuals in it. Why people trust politicians is beyond me and why people vote for more taxes for inept govt… yeah I’ll never understand that.
1
Corporate taxes affect everyone.  Because all taxes are taxes on wealth, and all wealth is held by individuals, corporations don't really pay the taxes - we do. Corporations just collect the taxes for the government.  When corporate taxes increase, they pay them in three ways:  reducing dividens to the share holders, reducing wages / bonuses to the employees, and increasing the cost of their goods and services...If you have a 401K or other market account, you are affected by the first way. If you are employed by a corporation, you are affected by the second, and if you purchase goods, you are affected by the third.  Everyone is affected by corporate tax.
1
Oh, just you wait.
1
No but 45% capital gains will make sure it’s not worth it to build up a nest egg over years, just for almost half to be taken. Are they going to pay me back 45% of my losses when I lose money?
1
So bill gates has to pay taxes on his stocks...Bill gates sells Microsoft stock. Microsoft price goes down. My 401k/retirement goes down. It affects everyone…....Crazy how people don’t get it
1
Except it will cause stock prices to.Fall and corporate headquarters to push out of the US.
1
Corporate tax effects almost everyone. That's your 401k retirement. If you want to fairly tax wealthy you need to raise the capital gains tax which is income earned from not working.
1
This affects me.
1
Until inflation continues so that you need 100MM to retire
1
Stupidest thing I’ve read today (I think).
1
Yeah if you don't think the economy impacts you then you're right
1
Until those above the cap sell off enough to pay the taxes until they are eventually under the cap.  Once the number of individuals drops below a threshold, they will lower the ceiling.  This will continue until it eventually reaches the middle class, their 401k and homes (since home price inflation is an unrealized gain)
1
Until they decide to write that rule where all Americans unrealized gains are taxed.

Insanely childish thinking.

Don’t think you understand the meaning behind **Pandora’s Box** do you?..This is a **”Pandora’s Box”**, a curse unleashed, as it sets the precedence for the unlawful seizure of property in the future. ..If you realize that nation states [currently] hold a monopoly on violence and the issuance of money (legal tender) and taxation in that legal tender, you begin to understand the implications and **WHY**, the PEOPLE, are reluctant to embrace such a move. ..**It is a gross over reach of power and a signal of an intent to erode your liberty.**..You absolutely should go read the history of income tax in the United States:..> In 1913, the top tax bracket was 7 percent on all income over $500,000 ($11 million in today’s dollars1); and the lowest tax bracket was 1 percent.

Read history much? If you honestly think it won’t soon hit every other wealth threshold, then you deserve everything coming to you. ..This is how almost every tax in history started. Get people to buy in because it’s “tax the rich” and set the precedent. Then over the next decades roll it out to everyone.

The fact you don’t think raising corporate tax rates to 28% won’t impact anyone here is scary.
1
Do you really think a 28% corporate tax rate would not affect anyone in this sub?
1
A corporate tax hike affects anyone who owns US equities or has an interest in the growth rate of the US economy.
1
Just because it doesn't directly effect most Americans doesn't mean it's a good idea. It's hard to say what it would do to the economy until implemented but it sets the precedent, which many have already noted will be applied more broadly as time passes.
1
That’s what people said when the income tax was proposed “only for the rich”…. And now….
1
Im all for rich people being taxed but taxing unrealized gains is not something we don’t want for anyone. Just remove the loopholes available and do a 25% tax on realized gains.
1
It hasn’t stopped conservatives from using Harris’s tax plan as a talking point about how she’ll tax us to death. My conservative coworker earns $100k per year and he’s telling everyone how he’ll have to pay $25k in taxes more per year because of Kamala’s tax plan. Like, you aren’t that important bro, you’ll be fine.

There are no people with small business in this sub reddit?  Guarantee it will effect them

Until it does. Income taxes started and were passed by saying it was only for the mega wealthy and now look where we are. They want to tax the hundreds of trillions of unrealized gains in your retirement accounts. This paves the way to that.
1
Actually it will,because they might have to dump non liquid assets to pay their tax bills. ..Plenty of rich people would rather move countries, pay exit taxes and lose their US citizenship
1
Yeah - forcing annual asset dumps by every whale to pay this tax will cause annual market crashes. Think about it - tax bill comes, they dump stock/crypto to pay it, market supply increases, prices come down, repeat every year…..This is about as basic of economic principles as you can get and so few people understand it… quite alarming how dumb every single person who supports this is. You can immediately determine if someone has any level of critical thinking just by their support for this one policy.

Lmfao so stupid. What in the world do you think will happen to the people in this subreddit as a result of this going into effect? Are unable to comprehend the downstream effects or are you that narrow minded?

Until it does.

While I think the pros of such a tax plan outweigh the cons, this is simply not true. Just because you won't be directly taxed doesn't mean the downstream effect on the market won't impact every investor

But…but my rights!

Corporate tax will 100% effect all of us. You don’t think they will raise prices or lay off staff if this is incorporated?
1
Yes it will. This is the part of trickle down that does trickle down.
1
That’s not really true.  Even the Biden administration hired more irs workers to go after the ultra rich and they got tons of of tax revenue back.  ..You are correct that they will find every loophole they can but they will pay more or they wouldn’t be fighting these policies so hard

Exactly!  If they bring in 1 billion dollars, they’ll just give 2 billion to Ukraine

...is to give the USD any value, and combat inflation...You think Senators are paid commission on revenue?

This. People assume my opposition to taxes like this is because I’m worried about it being taken out of my income. That’s only part of it...I detest the people running our government and I don’t want them to have more money from *anyone* because it all goes to funding wars and corporations.

I wonder if this will incentivize ultra high net worth individuals to purchase more houses/more expensive houses/luxury goods to avoid the tax. That seems like a risk that wealthy people will consume more. 
5
Just like the income tax originally only was to affect a very small percentage of people - it will be expanded.
3
It's still dumb as hell
4
Are vested stock options considered tradable assets? Because if so, this means you are forcing owners of growing companies to liquidate their ownership interests in their own company to cover the 25% tax on their unrealized gains every year… this math doesn’t math. ..Also people saying “it won’t affect you unless you are ultra rich!!” Don’t understand how precedent works. Once a concept is accepted, it will be expanded on continually until the application of the concept 20 years from now will be well beyond the originally communicated intention.

You also have to remember if they don't have the cash on hand they have to sell the stock putting downward pressure on the whole stock market. They means less returns for everyone.

Strictly speaking impuesto sobre el Patrimonio is a wealth tax, not an unrealised gains tax. You could have €15m in assets and have an unrealised capital loss of €4m euros and still be on the hook for Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio, just with an €11m tax basis instead of a €15m one...You would not, however, be on the hook for an unrealised gains tax in this scenario, because you in fact have an unrealised loss.
1
And that’s why no one with ambition starts companies in Spain

Except when this barely increases government revenue and they realize they already have the enforcement infrastructure in place, that “$100m” will be lowered. After all, it’s just for people with over $10m, then over $1m, then eventually everyone, just like income tax...You have to stand up for an injustice done for people you dislike unless you want it done to yourself.

Almost - you’re taxed a la AMT when your RSUs vest for the value at time of vesting, and then if the stock goes down, as an example, you actually can claim a loss but there are restrictions on how quickly you can get the loss back.  During the dot com crash, I lost a lot of money because of this but still had to pay the AMT tax bill, and then only got the money back $3k at a time per year.  They had since changed to accelerate the ways you could get the money back but it was still slow.  It’s been a while but i think you would need to spread effectively through 3-5 years - something like you get 30% of it back at a time until it reaches a certain dollar threshold that you get the rest back.  So, I guess that if you had 10’s of millions in losses, you would get the money back over a large number of years..Effectively, that would make it an interest free loan to the government.  ..My bigger issue with this is that there is absolutely no discussion or policy proposal to cut spending.  If we’re just being taxed to generate more revenue so that the deficit is smaller, then we’re still growing the national debt.  ..I take exception to the politicians trying to confuse people between deficit and debt.  They reduced the deficit but they just made it less shitty of a situation.  They need to eliminate the deficit and balance the budget.  These new taxes will NOT pay even for the new spending that people want to do.  This will therefore allow inflation to actually reaccelerate and put this country into another wave of big problems.

RSU taxes only come into play upon vesting unless you do an 83b election which for a private company id probably do unless it’s a dogshit company going nowhere and you’re getting issued at a high with some prayer of IPO or down rounds are on the horizon.  No 83b-at vesting you owe $20 on the $100 of stock.  Why would they be worthless unless the company totally tanks or you get diluted to the tits?
1
No, they will be incentivized to find other ways around the tax, through shell & holding companies, family members, citizenships, and lastly; moving their company somewhere else.

Sounds like a recipe for stock market crash

This is a great point. I can totally see founders getting affected by this as their shares approach $100M. Think about how so many founders changed as they approach these unicorn levels: WeWork, OpenAI, Uber, etc. Maybe even Theranos would have been saved if Holmes had an exit strategy pre-100M.

Yes, I am sure you are just a day away from being impacted by this proposed tax.

I read into this a bit a few weeks ago when Marc Andreessen was bitching about it on his podcast. I totally get why taxing unrealized gains is weird, but this bill seems to be targeted at the right place...I still don't understand how price for a given year will be determined, which is kind of a big issue, since different strategies will cause different types of market fuckery, but I still think it's a good idea. My comment below provides a bit more context as to the cooler aspects of this...[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1f2hmpm/comment/lk6wi7e/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1f2hmpm/comment/lk6wi7e/)

You can say that about anything that rich people are forced to do so that's a terrible reason to not do anything.

"it will drive the rich away." Don't threaten me with a good time.

Why waste time on something that has 0% chance of passing?
1
"But if they tax wealthy people, then surely they'll start taxing poor people next!" is a completely braindead take, you get that right? The entire point of raising taxes on the ultra-wealthy who can afford it is to reduce the tax burden from everyone else, who probably would have a harder time paying them. Would you rather they just tax poor people instead? What are you proposing here?..Taxes are used to pay for services. If you think we already have too many services in the US for improving quality of life, then you can make the argument that we don't need more tax revenue, but it seems to me that a lot of people are hurting and could use the extra support, especially when it comes to things like healthcare.

Funny I'm getting down voted for the same thought in my comment...Comeyely agree though, obviously. Just another revenue source for the government to incrementally toy with.

Or a load of selling end of  this year so not to be affected by the proposed bill.
1
I mean, can't you apply this logic to *any* tax on capital gains?..Most people with that kind of net worth aren't taking the proceeds of their stock sales and spending it all on yachts, they're reinvesting it in stocks in other market sectors, and that buy pressure pushes those stocks' value up - so, then, any tax on *realized* capital gains decreases how much is getting reinvested, which decreases said buy pressure, so the price of those stocks doesn't rise as quickly...So, you can't actually *avoid* the slowdown you're referring to unless you reduce the capital gains tax rate to 0%, you can only delay it, which seems like a recipe for creating a bubble. Alternatively, if you allow that slight slowdown each year, growth is slightly slower, but the probability of creating a bubble that eventually collapses is also lower.
1
Oh you mean I can buy stocks for less money? Yes please!

small pull back not the worst thing in the world for an overvalued market isn't a bad thing. prevent a huge collapse when things come back to reality. unfettered growth is not a positive thing; that's exactly what cancer is

1
You didn’t read the article linked in this post I guess? ..He’s referring to a line in the linked article for this post. There’s a specific line that says “ Furthermore, in outlining the new tax plan, Biden assured that individuals earning less than $400,000 annually would not face tax hikes.”..The unrealized gains portion only effect people who make over 100M, but the other action items in the proposal DO effect people under 100M(specifically 400k-100M+.
1
 Let’s be real here, neither of you gentleman have nearly enough assets for this to affect you and you may not even be close to getting there in the next 4-8 years. Stop acting like you’re millionaires and join reality. In the eyes of the elite, you’re both just as worthless as the rest of us.

Well maybe the fact the us has 30+ trillion of e debt that will need to be paid. So they have to raise more money. Over history there have been multiple examples of taxes that started with the rich and made their way to everyone else. Like basic income tax for example.
1
Almost all of them? First, income taxes at the state and Federal level are generally not indexed for inflation, so if prices double in 10 years and your wages double in 10 years, you've gone into a higher tax bracket and are paying more taxes even though your purchasing power has stayed the same. ..Regarding rates, I live in Illinois. Initially, the rate was 2.5%, then 3%, now 5%. It's a flat rate, so no brackets...Our gas tax has increased from 19% in 2018, to 39% in 2019, to 40% in 2020. This with gas prices averaging $2.94 per gallon in 2018 versus $3.95 per gallon in 2022. Good times...Our sales tax tripled from its original 2% to 6.25% and when you combine it with city and county sales taxes, our state averages about 9% with Chicago at 10.25%, among the highest in the country...I won't even get into property taxes, where we have the second highest in the country, after New Jersey...

Lol. Not a fan of capitalism, I take it?..First, the companies don't hold the stock, except for a small amount of treasury shares. ..Second, last time I checked, we didn't have slavery or indentured servitude. Everyone with a job chose to work there. Well, except for China, but I suspect you are a fan of theirs. ..Third, this "gambling" is how companies raise money to build things like factories and places where people work and make stuff. ..Last, you know this is a crypto sub, right? Most people consider that to be far more akin to gambling than investing in the S&P 500.
1
What you're saying is that every single year they will lose 25%  of their wealth, 25% no matter even if they are down. That won't even make it to the floor because they need their money to be re-elected. They could just tax their companies at a regular rate instead of giving them unnecessary tax credits every year

This is just the beginning. The 100 million will be lowered and lower until it is most of us.

Oh, so this is what they're doing to us peasants now. However, if other guardrails are in place, the U.S. enforces its anti-monopoly laws seriously, and eases barriers for new businesses entering industries, it will be much harder to shift the burden onto the middle and working class. There isn't going to be a single silver bullet but it's going to take a comprehensive plan.

As if offshoring stopped or reduced after corporate tax reduced to 20%. Almost all companies already moved their headquarters to Ireland and many are paying in single digits anyway.
24
If corporations can offshore jobs to save or make money they aren’t going to wait for 28% to finally do it. They will already have done it.
19
Yeah it was even called out if you actually read the whole article. The hike on corporate taxes will potentially cause middle income earners to have less opportunity for jobs and raises in pay.

And did lowering their taxes bring back jobs? No.

It will affect regular ppl, but the question is whether the net benefits will outweigh the cons (I think so).

We could prevent that by eliminating deductions for the cost of moving jobs overseas.

No, this is not how off-shoring happened. You don’t sound like you have any clue.

It will decrease my chances of buying more property and will actually increase the cost of homes. The people footing the bill for those that shouldn’t own a home to begin with will be those that actually put down a down payment. We will have people buying 400k +  homes with 25k down payments. You can’t make this shit up. This will cause another 2008 housing crisis. People have to be either extremely stupid or naive to vote for this bullshit.

Corporate tax rates were literally 3x higher during americas most productive and prosperous times.  Google it
2
I'm sure it will but...do you think they won't still increase prices and lay off staff if they aren't taxed? As the last 4 years have shown they can and WILL layoff thousands of people and raise prices sky high to gain more profit. If the outcome is the same either way...make them pay taxes.

Idk how any of the poor corporations survived.... 7 years ago when it was higher than 28%

My last company had record profits last year.  The executives got their bonus.  Everyone else did not meet corporate’s expectations.  As a result our bonus was 1/2 of what it should have been.  This was after having the lowest effective tax rate in the history of the company.  Now they are talking about Q4 lay offs.  ..Greedy fuckers are going to be little greedy bastards no matter that the tax rate.

You can borrow against your vested stock options right? So I would at yes. If ultra wealthy can use those assets to get more cash/loan themselves money, I absolutely agree it should be able to be taxed. ..The trickle down “argument” isn’t even worth addressing.
0
You have to remember if they don’t pay their share of taxes normal people have to continue paying their 35% allowing the ultra wealthy to continue their upward trajectory. ..I’d be curious how many people actually fall into the realm of 100m net worth, with 80% in tradable assets, and don’t pay 25%. Quit the fear mongering.
1
It isn’t very many people, but they are very high net worth, and I believe the estimation is that it would move the needle, since right now those people pay very low effective tax rates.
1
Is way more complicated than that. I’m pretty sure is an average. Also last time I read this tax is only when you have holding stock +3 years, and then on the 4 or the 3rd year they will tax it...So this is because most ultra rich people 100000k people don’t use money like you and me, they use the brokerage system to pay for their expenses without paying taxes. This is not as simple as you think it is.
13
From my understanding it only affects people with 100 million in stocks and other assets and would only prevent them from having a tax rate of the 18% per year due to their accounting tricks.  Because these people don't have a traditional job and live off the capital gains, they don't pay the higher interest income tax rate.   The purpose is to lift them up to the 20%ish range of others paying income tax...It is to go after hedge fund managers and estimates are that it will affect about 400 people aka not you...I'm pretty sure you just want them to suck your balls anyway so I won't stop you.
22
It’s her money, you are just temporarily holding it.
11
People with $100m in net assets don’t have a majority of assets in highly volatile- at least those who intend on keeping a net worth that high.
10
That is kind of the point, to reduce volatility of investments, so the markets shift to more stable and long term investments.
1
no one will kno if u 'keep it a secret'.....cash em out off shore..
1
You’re talking about $100k - this is for $100 million. We average Americans can’t even fathom having $100 million in assets. The tax isn’t for us, stop thinking it is.
1
In essence yes. So even if this is “not affecting you because you don’t have $100m”, it will affect markets where your investments are held when wealthy people are selling mass amounts of investments to pay taxes on paper gains

700k in assets is not super rich by any means, nor can lawyers do much about it for most people whose assets are located in Spain.
3
It's one more tax that was supposed to be for the "super rich", whose brackets haven't been updated with inflation over the years, so now it affects people with less and less purchasing power (700K now is not 700K 20 years ago). Also, the way it's calculated, it can disproportionately affect people with volatile assets.
1
You have to have over 100 million for it to apply to you trust me it’s never going to happen
6
The people this impacts aren’t moving up classes.
11
What social class do you move up to after you’ve already accumulated 100 million which is who this tax applies to.

Move up from being worth $99M in assets ?

It only for rich folks,  poor upwardly mobile folks can benefit from programs - as has happened before. ( VA)

that's the goal! democrats want the people to depend on the government and limit the upside individuals have making it less attractive for anyone interested in starting a business or innovating.

Sounds like more scare tactics from MAGA.

Keep worrying about the tax rates billionaires pay because they aren’t worrying about people like you.

TIL asking people who have obtained (usually by exploiting workers and /or finite natural resources, at best) more money than they could possibly ever spend to give a tiny fraction of that excess wealth (which will have zero impact on their - or their descendants - quality of life) back to the society they live in and profit from is an “injustice”.
1
Yeah, I agree we need to be linking revenue increases to spending cuts as well. These both have recessionary impacts that we could absorb given FF rates at 5% but it's something to monitor and honestly I'm not sure we have a choice.

That’s the best part, they’re going to increase taxes AND spending.

I don't even begin to understand the sort of algorithm they would use to tax "potential gains". Do you get a write off for "potential losses"? If so, they would likely offset each other to some extent.

Your comment is how shit is sold to the public, but it isn’t how things work. ..The income tax started only for the supremely wealthy, and then continued to be applied to more and more of the public over a period of decades. Now, it applies to almost everyone. OP is suggesting this will happen here as well...The vast majority of income tax revenue is used to pay interest on the debt, not for services. I believe it is projected to be something like 80% of income tax will be paid to interest next year. Services are paid by debt...Tax increases on the rich are not generally followed by tax breaks for others...The last 4 times that the tax rate for the richest people went down (60s, 80s, 2000s, 20teens) the percentage of all taxes paid by rich people went up and the total income tax collection went up. Even in this last round of tax cuts with Trump, tax revenue collected by the government went up, not down...People think the argument for tax breaks for the rich is “trickle down economics will make the average income for poor people will go up” - this is demonstrably untrue, but it isn’t really the point of tax policy, either...It turns out tax policy is really hard and complicated. Higher taxes on the rich don’t mean more tax revenue, less tax burden for everyone else, or even that rich people will pay a higher percentage of total income tax. ..This wealth tax is likely to do nothing at best and hurt retirement portfolios at worst. It is best characterized as political theater.

You honestly think that there are plans to REDUCE the tax burden? Government expenses go one way only - up.

This is a naive fairy tale version of how life works and is utterly divorced from reality.

LOL - I posted this before...They'll try to pass this by saying, "Hey! Don't worry! It will only be on people that make more than $100 million!"..Then, like literally every other tax, they will do two things when it doesn't get them enough money, just like the original Federal income tax and most state taxes. First, they will say, "Hey! We're creating a 10% bracket for those with more than $1 million. But don't worry! It's only on them!" Then it will be, "Hey! We're creating a 5% bracket, but it's only on those with more than $100,000!" EVERY country in the world that creates a tax has done this over time...The second thing is more insidious - they will absolutely not index any of our new tax brackets for inflation. The Alternative Minimum Tax. A 10% tax originally designed to target the richest 154 families, has gone to 21%, then 24%, 26% and now 28%. Today? The 2023 threshold for single taxpayers is $81,300, $63,250 for Married, filing separately...TLDR: When the AMT was introduced, it was for people who made $200k in 1969, the equivalent of $1.7 million. Today, the AMT hits people making $63,000.

The market money consolidates in the winner’s hands generally. So they sell all the time, but they’re on average buying more than they sell. If they start selling 2.5% annually of their portfolio without replacement, the market will be greatly affected. More than 2.5% for sure.

No - you can control/choose when to realize capital gains. Zero flexibility here.

That would not be a one off pullback. It would be a permanent slowdown of stock markets valuation growth

You… 😆 nevermind
1
Lol, it's not a buying opportunity. There will be a permanentkh increased selling pressure on stocks...It will slow down stock price growth ratio.
1
Yeah, it will get priced in by slightly suppressing the growth rate. And that's the impact I have been talking about

Index funds grow what 7% avg yearly? A yearly selling pressure like this could drop that to below inflation rate. ..Another thing to keep people working until they're dead.

You didn’t read the article linked in this post I guess? ..He’s referring to a line in the linked article for this post. There’s a specific line that says “ Furthermore, in outlining the new tax plan, Biden assured that individuals earning less than $400,000 annually would not face tax hikes.”..The unrealized gains portion only affects people who make over 100M, but the other action items in the proposal DO affect people under 100M(specifically 400k-100M+. ..Maybe you should actually read the article before you criticize the reading comprehension of others. ..I should also note before you reply, that I’m in full support of the unrealized gains tax.
1
They do not. You can get loans backed by a stock portfolio with no mandatory repayment plan. It just keeps accruing interest until you die (or the stock tanks below an established threshold) then the lender can liquidize a portion of your portfolio to make the money back...Its basically a mortgage with stocks and no monthly payments.

You are not understanding. They still pay almost no taxes while alive. Read about it.

What are the other examples?  Because every time this comes up, all I hear is Income tax this, Income tax that.  Income tax started 140 years ago.  It was a completely different world back then.  There is zero reason to tax unrealized gains for the middle class.
1
its just a really weak argument to use.  We have to pay off debt, and taxes is one way to do that, so lets not put in place another tax on the very wealthy as then the feds might put that same tax on the middle class.  Makes no sense.
1
I'm not a fan no, but I understand how it functions from a political and economic perspective. I'm not going to argue that we have a slavery system like some lefties might, but to say you have a "choice" is disingenuous. Unless you were born wealthy you don't have a choice not to work, "choosing" to live a destitute life by not having any income is hardly a real choice, capitalism is by no means the worst political system that has existed, you could argue its the best one so far, but it's not the economic end state. Time moves forward and capitalism will eventually be replaced by a new system that better serves humanity, but we're getting off topic. ..People of high net worth should be taxed on unrealised gains, crypto, stocks, whatever the case may be. I think 100m is a very generous threshold and think 10m is far more reasonable, not that I think the tax brackets should remain the same. 10m in the S&P 500 with a 3% drawdown per year (300k a year) is for most people and obscenely luxurious lifestyle and at a 3% withdrawal (as well as adjusting for inflation each year) you'll likely die with more money than you started with, all while getting to live a life completely insulated from any financial hardship. People with that amount of wealth should be taxed for it, it won't hurt them, they'll still be just fine.
1
Very very sure they dont consider blatantly taxing already taxed money
1
It’s 25% of the gains, not net worth (which is VERY different), am I wrong?

Yeah i don't care it doesn't apply to me. It's a fundamentally unfair tax so i will never support it...But if you have a victim mindset you won't take the effort to think and just see taxes on billionaires and agree stupidly.

So I took your advice and looked into it, rather than taking your word for it, and according to TaxFoundation.org the effective tax rate for 93% of the USA population has been falling consistently.

jfc youre not worth enough to make taking unrealized capital gains worth it. the political fight would be absurdly hard. youre arguing total nonsense.

 It sure if you realize but both corporate and income taxes today are significantly lower than they were 50 years ago

You have to be silly if you think any dem politician has the desire to place a 25% on unrealized gains for the average American. Tax the rich has been a talking point for at least a decade now. Never heard the Dems running on a platform of tax the poor. You also have to be silly if you think this will ever even become a reality. Every billionaire in this country will use all of their power and sway to stop it.
1
1. do you really think there will be so much inflation in the next 100% years where the average American will have a nominal net worth of 100 million?..2. Would it be better to define the cutoff as 6 standard deviations above the mean instead of 100 million? ..3. Or are you opposed to any additional tax at all because it is “theft”?
1
Yea because going after middle americas money won’t hurt them during elections or anything.  Did you even think before you posted?
1
Yeah because cutting taxes for the ultra wealthy helps to feed the middle class. 🙄..We’re already bankrupting families by having such dog shit social safety nets. You want to talk about not reinvesting in the economy?

Well, trickle down economics never quite made it down far enough. Maybe trickle down tax increases won't make it down  past the $400,000/yr income group. I'm willing to try it out and see.

Why don't you make this case when they propose that change? This particular law doesn't affect any middle class people but only the ultra rich.

The average household doesn't have shit for unrealized capital gains. Especially in stocks.
1
I’m so tired of slippery slope arguments that stand in the way of otherwise reasonable policy. ..No. It would be political suicide to apply this to ordinary Americans. The slope isn’t that slippery. But someone has to close the loophole that lets people borrow against unrealized gains and avoid taxes entirely with their heirs getting a step up basis on death.
1
If they start to move the tax down to the middle class, we can just vote them out. Make our voice heard, no higher tax on the middle class and lower class.
1
This would be true if they weren't going to generate a shit ton of money just by going after the ultra rich. Literally nothing to worry about there - now if the other side gets in charge again expect them to tax cut the rich and hit the working/middle class hard, just like they did last time they were in charge.

Taxes don’t bankrupt people. Ffs

Do you honestly think that a family who is scraping by would even have money to invest in stocks? A lot of folks can't even afford their own homes now. How would this supposed rule for an individual with more than 100 million net worth even get down to the average American who's net worth is around 300k. The government has been trying to get less for the last 40 years and you can see the effects. People today complain about high college tuition costs but don't realize that college tuition used to be low because State and Federal governments used to pay for more than half.

So is that your way of saying that we should do nothing about wealth inequality, even when we seem to be moving towards a world where eventually 99% of us will own nothing?

This is just the slippery slope fallacy. Even if they eventually lowered it to 10 million dollar threshold, it still wouldn’t effect 99% of people

Or we can kick 50 million people off of healthcare and social security like the republicans plan to...But seriously the massive debt is a huge problem for young people’s future.  How do you tackle that?  ..This seems like the best solution, and quite frankly the fear mongering on its going to come to everyone just seems like that, fear mongering

Increasing corporate tax rates expedites offshoring, bringing it back and trying to be competitive will take way longer. .You can offshore and maintain or increase profits, once you are offshore, financially it doesn’t work to bring it back unless conditions make it lucrative to do so. Why is this difficult for people to understand???.Stop creating conditions to offshore jobs, keep them here.  .I work manufacturing. I’ve lost my job two times, once in September of 08, the other in April 24. Everyone knows what happened in 08, and now in 24 wages went up, housing went up food went up. Subsequently no one is buying homes, and surely no one is fixing them up with the consumer goods domestically produced. California minimum wage closed my facility this year. .Tariffs will bring goods back onshore. Lower taxes will bring more companies to work for. I’ll find work, but not in CA…the problem isn’t US companies, it’s government spending hard earned money on people who aren’t working as hard.
1
you give one a reason to go taste the pie, they then want the whole pie even when the reason is taken away. Thats how this works. Only thing US can do to bring back business is compete and set corporate tax to single digits or lower. But of course they won't do that lol.

It doesn’t happen over night.  People need to feel confidence in the economy to take a huge risk and start a business, and grow it. Bringing jobs back takes time, unlike offshoring jobs.  You mention government mandated minimum wage, and government mandated this or that, businesses factor that into costs. And for those who don’t understand how or what a business does, the moment the effort to run the business and the costs to run it are closer to the revenues, the business closes, restructuring happens, businesses ask its employees to do more work with less people. .It’s lunacy to continue to push the same economic theories and expect different outcomes. History has shown us government involvement in our lives has led to the worst economic downturns in various countries. .Putting earned money in everyone’s pocket instead of the governments, will give the consumer confidence and the gov gets the tax revenue. Blowing it in projects like researching how cats jack off is a waste of my tax dollars. Surely everyone can agree on that….

No there’s the actual problem!
1
You need to lower the deficit or we pay for it in the future with higher inflation.  No one increased the deficit more than Donald Trump and that was even before he spent 4 trillion during Covid and spiked inflation...Dealing with the deficit you either tax the wealthy a little more or you can deal with it the way Trump wants to which is kick people off healthcare and social security

11
I agree with you but this is a very corny reply
-5
It’s called precedent- once the concept of taxing unrealized gains becomes accepted, it will be expanded on. ..The first income tax in the US was a 3% income tax from the Revenue Act of 1862 which was only applicable to those earning > $800/year which excluded lower incomes being affected. Idk about you but today I’m paying 34% income tax and have zero yachts or mansions to my name. ..You are gaslighting people into accepting something that will definitely affect them down the line.

IDK man I put the question and your answer in chatgpt and it didn't understand how it covers stock tanking either. It seems to me that your argument is that people worth over $100m just can take the loss.

How are they avoiding paying income taxes? The top 1% pays 40-45% of the income taxes, right?..If they’re not paying what they owe (i.e. breaking the law), prosecute them. ..Taxing people for money they haven’t even made yet is a separate issue. ..Not like it matters though, this will never even get to the Senate. Just another ploy for votes.

I'm not happy with any taxation - it's all theft.

>they use the brokerage system to pay for their expenses without paying taxes..You mean they offset their gains with losses? You can literally do this with like 300 bucks on Robinhood.

Crypto is pretty volatile. So are regular stocks like IRobot, now at $7.53, but $119 in 2021, $41 in 2020, $129 in 2019, $30 in 2016. If they taxed an unrealized gain from 2020 to 2021,how would they reimburse the investor in 2024?

Yeah but purely the concept.. taxing something you don’t have… it’s so fucking disgusting… I suppose spanish people reaching that threshold leave the country to avoid that theft..

It's just the greedy being greedy - anyone arguing against taxes on unrealized gains at this level of wealth are just pissed that they can't use those unrealized gains to continue to abuse the system. ..IMO, at the very least, they should tax unrealized gains in instances where loans are being taken using those unrealized gains as leverage for the loan...Buy, borrow, die is cancerous and stems from lack of oversight on massive amounts of unrealized wealth. Something needs to be done. Granted, higher interest rates as of late are stifling this kind of abuse, but the fact that the system supports it in the first place is ridiculous.

There is no amount of benefit the government could provide me with my share of Bezo’s tax income that would compensate me for the value Amazon gives me as an employee, customer, and now seller.

But it’s about a poorly thought out populist proposal with devastating second-order effects.

Wealth is created from thin air, not “exploited”. And they already give 90% to 99% back to society without even considering taxes...Their wealth is used not to support themselves, but to change the world for the better. Selfish and materialistic people like you don’t understand that. Bill Gates has saved millions of lives, and if he had been taxed it would’ve just gone to fund more interest payments on the national debt.

Of course we have a choice.  But it is like a lot of what people are dealing with - the credit card is max’ed and cannot get any more.  Gotta start paying the debt down.  We have to do this otherwise the credit will get worse and therefore the interest rates on our debt both current and any additional debt we need to issue, will be even more expensive.  It is also a matter of national security, in my mind.  ..Recessionary impacts, yes.  That’s an inevitability.

the money goes to military and to healthcare..they need to be cut in order to balance that budget

Yes. Why would you create a hundred billion dollar opportunity, risk hundreds of millions, forgo 10s of millions of guaranteed salary somewhere else, just to get a hundred million?..Startup Founders already on average don’t make that much compared to just getting a job.

If the majority of the stock is owned by individuals with more than >100m, then yeah, maybe, but the point here is that those situations shoudn't exist in a healthy market that's actually supported by retail, not just whales playing weird whale games.

It's not a delta, it's a sum. If the sum of all your assets is greater than $100m, including unrealized gains from investments, then you owe some percent on money greater than that...If you realize those losses, then yeah, you can claim them as lost income. That has always been a thing, but that's just normal capital gains stuff. "Unrealized losses" don't make sense in this context because it's not really the "unrealized gains" you're paying the wealth tax it, it's just the total assets.
1
that means she doesn't have policy within the realm of possibilities?
1
Nope, income tax only really applies to people making $60k+, and only applies on income made above that. I'd love for it to be bumped up to $100k or so, and track inflation, but we are where we are. Less than 60% of US households were required to pay income tax in 2022...Are you actually worried about hurting retirement portfolios of people whith over $100m? That seems like a pretty wild argument to me.

No way, I'm a very liberal Social Democrat, I think taxes are way too low :-D  And yes, I have had some 7 figure income years recently and I personally pay a fuck ton of taxes. We need to, at a minimum, figure out how to provide healthcare to the people who need it in the US. Heathcare costs are \*still\* the number one cause of bankruptcy, which is absolutely shameful for a modern society. ..Taxes are way too low in the US. I also think gas is way too cheap (largely due to shitty subsidies). I don't drive though, so don't really have any exposure to high gas prices.

gonna take a millennia for you to get affected with your 5k annual salary though.

I mean, yeah, that's pretty much what I said at the end - with taxes on unrealized gains you're forced to have a very small slowdown each year, instead of having the *flexibility* to create a bubble that gives you a massive slowdown all at once when it collapses...Also, my initial question was mostly rhetorical - pretty much any actual economist will tell you that, yes, *any* tax on capital gains will cause economic growth to be slower.

maybe some wealthy will sell of some stocks, dropping the indices, but thats a very short term impact.  The money from selling will go to other in estments, instead of being locked away.

The issue is high net worth individuals pay less than middle class. The issue isnt tax existing. (Protect the rich, cuz we're next) it's a fair and proportional tax.

Which just proves the point that “rich” is a subjective term. It’s all relative. Who is going to decide where “rich” ends and “comfortable” begins and “well off”, “middle class (high/mid/low” etc come into play. And even those classifications depend on where you live, what your job is, what personal choices you make in life etc. Seems like people are happy to let the govt make those distinctions.  The fact is you can take all the money and income from all the so called “rich” and it won’t be enough to cancel the US debt - AND congress will just up their spending and put us back in the same place. We have to get spending under control and we need elected officials with courage to take that on. The waste and over spending in this country an appalling.

You are not understanding. I am not talking about the tax structure whatsoever. I'm talking about the definition of a loophole.

What’s wrong with that?

You are far more rational than most of reddit, but still wrong. You do have a choice. You can do subsistence farming, grow your own food, trade/barter for clothes, etc. but you choose not to. But yes, in the end, everyone needs to work, whether it is working the land or working a job, even in unrealistic utopias that most of reddit envisions. Sure, there are those that assume everyone will be a poet or musician or artist, but that only works until the food runs out and there is no more electricity...Why do you get to choose the level of "acceptable" income, and why $300k? The average annual income in, say Somalia, is about $600. In India, it is $2,500, in the Philippines it is about $4,000. Why don't we say everyone gets $5,000 per year? That's double the amount in India, 4x the amount in Somalia!

They want to tax unrealized gains. So pretty much your net worth

You are correct,  the person above you is wrong.

>So explain why we need the ultra wealthy...There are trillions of dollars of debt, someone has to hold it.

No but apparently SCOTUS can. Regardless, this concept that the debt is “forgiven” is nonsense. Debt doesn’t disappear, it’s transferred. To you, to me, to our children. Don’t buy into the spin.

If you had read it correctly you would noticed I wrote most streets and schools not all. However, it begs the question where does the federal government get money from? Oh you say, the local tax payers. Why yes that is correct. They also are currently printing money beyond tax collections as well. But cutting the federal government will far exceed balancing the budget more than taxing the few billionaires there are. Contrary to what you think keyboard warrior, they know how to make and keep their money. No you say? Then why do they have it now and you are crying about it. Easier to blame others for what you don’t have than go earn yourself something dude huh.

That’s because they have been coming for our guns for the last 60 years. Slowly chipping away, from banning certain weapons to arbitrary gun laws and restrictions, just check out the recent gun regulations passed down in most states ran by democrats.

Guns is a terrible example.  They’re still CONSTANTLY trying to take our guns, we just have people pushing back constantly...There’s some new “assault weapons” ban or other proposal every single election cycle.

you looked into the wrong thing..the income tax was considered unconstitutional for hundreds of years. It was finally passed when politicians said it’s just a 1% tax on the 1% most wealthy people..then, as always, once they got that through, they expanded it continuously

lmao maybe the dems of 50 years ago. dems want as much money for the gov as possible and as much people to rely on government as possible. never heard a dem say government takes too much of your money.

no, thank you i’ll try that next time.

true!.not reinvesting in the economy is huge! especially with this who want to own homes, stock, property, etc. if you’ll be taxed on it if it goes up in value. .this economy is already in shambles. cannot imagine the effects this will have…
1
exactly my point. it’s not if but when it will effect the average american.
1
not true. this will hold true for homeowners. ..example: if your house goes up in value, that will be taxed on that value increase. even though you did not sell your home. that in itself will harm most americans. ..it’s also not true at all that the average household doesn’t have assets (unrealized gains). many people have assets in various forms!
1
you cannot decide policy without looking at future ramifications. that’s incredibly short sighted. and again stressing the history of every government ever, government will always seek the most power as it benefits to itself are exponential… if you can’t see that, or refuse to then idk what to tell ya.
1
bruh you just don’t understand what taxing unrecognized gains means. that’s wild🤣
1
when you start to tax unrecognized gains that are not even liquidated yes you can legitimately bankrupt someone. if i have a shirt, and that shirt increases in its worth (but you don’t sell it) and then you’re taxed on that increase in worth (which is this new plan) then you well end up with a net loss. compound that tax each year you’ll be out of money eventually, if that shirt keeps increasing in value…. it’s straight up robbery
1
is that your way of saying you want to steal from others and give to people that don’t deserve it?.don’t get me wrong wealth inequality sucks but you cannot forcibly change it, that’s when you’re getting into some treacherous water. unless you’re a straight up communist then i guess it’s a normal friday.

we’re a rare breed (understanding something instead of just copying things you see and hear on the internet) lollll

This is the same way income tax started lol..What followed that is how we ended up here. ..Poors paying tax, while the rich do not through the actual tax system in itself. If you do not actually understand how this will end up flipping, I’m not sure you understand what you are supporting.

Property tax is a way to hold you as a renter indefinitely. You should not have to pay property tax yearly. ..IF property tax is to exist it should be paid when the house is bought. After that, you shouldn’t have to continually pay.
1
Property tax is a use tax. You pay for local schools, roads, police, etc. with it. It goes directly back into your town. Where this will go in to the federal general budget which you have zero input over. This is an attempt to offset a spending problem, not push additional services into the hands of those who actually will fund it.

Where do you think the national debt comes from? Majority of it at least.

Check History of Corporate Tax in USA. Your jobs would have moved to offshore even if the corporate tax is zero. As I pointed out  many Fortune 500 companies have headquarters in Ireland, which has 7%. Even with zero percent, offshore manufacturing and shipping will cost way less for manufacturing. These companies currently using, well long time, corporate tax as a smokescreen to move jobs offshore. Anyway, I respect your opinion. GD.
1
There is a lot at play here. Increasing taxes can/will stress the workforce as companies will cut fat. Decreasing taxes can create more profit, more investment and more jobs and companies scramble to find talent to implement new products to generate further profit. This has the potential impact to create competition in the labor market and increase wages. Wages go up too much it’s inflation, talent is too hard to find or too expensive and it’s time to offshore. There’s always this push and pull. When limits are reached it gets ugly on either side.

thats an absurd logical point unless you can explain why its not just a function of tax. in which case arguing about tax entirely is pointless and both of you are idiots.

Yeah, this is just a test before they start coming after the all poor peoples unrealized capital gains, right? Bezos thanks you for your service.

Okay, let’s say they lower the threshold like you say. Explain to me how you see it works? This is targeting individuals who live their entire life off from net worth without having liquid cash paid to them. It’s all credit, and shifting numbers around...Anyone who is making 100k or even 250k a year is still paying taxes. They aren’t living their life on credit, stocks, and dividends. So, they are paying their 25% instead of hiding all their money in non-taxable assets. This affects such a small percentage of people, and I would be surprised if a single person in the middle class or lower brackets would see even a cent more taking this way.
1
Realized gains is just an accounting concept though - if you hold tradeable shares they’re pretty much as liquid as cash (even for those holding sizeable chunks, there are ways to liquidate positions without dumping in the market)..If your shares went from 1M to 1B, you’re a billionaire wether you sell your shares or not.
